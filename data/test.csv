Summary,Text
I love Hills!,"My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!"
"Thank you, Amazon!","My mom, who has always believed that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, approved of this product for her kids as a good substitute, ever since it first came out. In recent years, she's lost a lot of weight, and has become a very picky eater. When she refuses to eat what's on hand, she's given a glass of this - she also likes it at nighttime. Strawberry is her favorite, and has become nearly impossible to find, except in some variety packs (why??). I'm thrilled and grateful that Amazon carries it, and hope it continues to do so - I'll definitely continue to buy it!"
"Good product, good price","This is my third container of this drink mix. Once you find a flavor and concentration amount that works for you, stick with it, I say. Buying in this quantity is the best price per serving.  Fast free delivery too."
Soooo Good!,"The first time I had a cup of this tea was at my accupuncturist's clinic.  I came in from a wet rainy day and she offered me a cup of tea.  She asked what kind, I said, ""you decide.""<br />WOW!  Didn't know they made heaven in a cup!<br />by far my favourite version of earl grey, the lavender is such a nice touch & the other brands that are similar to this one just can't touch it!"
Not as good as Libby's; cans in bad condition,"There have been ongoing problems with dented and leaking cans with this product.  But my dogs HAVE to have it for their digestion, so I ordered a case somewhat reluctantly.<br /><br />In the first shipment I received, the cans were so badly dented that they looked like they had either been dropped from a considerable height or beaten with machetes.  One was actually leaking.  What's worse, the cans around the outside were apparently undamaged and had the damage turned to the INSIDE - and every badly damaged can was on the interior of the package.  That would seem to indicate that they were repacked to hide the damage -- otherwise the worst damage would be on the OUTSIDE.<br /><br />Good news:  Amazon cheerfully and without complaint replaced the bad cans, and while the replacement cans had a few dents they were not severe and nothing was leaking.<br /><br />That said, the pumpkin itself is not as good as Libby's solid pack.  It's very watery, and there are black flecks throughout.  I wouldn't use it for pies, but the dogs don't seem to care and it does them no harm."
"BEST PRICE FOR NEWMAN'S OWN ""ANYWHERE""","I used to buy on-line from a pet store and pay very high shipping charges.  Now I get it automatically once a month with ""no"" shipping charges.  You just can't beat this from Amazon!! 5 stars"
A Thoughtful Experience,"I love to try new experiences like a new restaurant, a new wine or a tea that I've never tasted before.  While this can be delightful, it can also be a disappointment at times.<br />My first taste of Ran Watte was not delightful.  Then I realized the problem was not the tea.  Being unfamiliar with this larger leaf, I had used to much tea & brewed it to strong.  The second try was perfect for my taste.<br />This tea reminds me of a very light Jasmine tea.  It is wonderful to sip without amendments but a touch of honey would make a great compliment, also.  Most teas this light seem to have little taste which leaves me wondering at the attempt to market them.  This one shows an interesting character, lightly brisk & the slightest hint of salty aftertaste that is unusual but not at all unpleasant.  For my preference, this tea is a great 'afternoon with a good book' kind of tea."
Kids love them too + they're Vegan!,"These are the best bars I have ever had. They are all delicious. I have kids ages 14, 12,9 & 2, and they all love these! I love the fact that you can actually pronouce all the ingredients, so you know exactly what you are eating."
Excellent and Tasty  Cold Tea,"If you have a cod or Bronchitis this tea is for you. It tastes great and has many good herbal remedies in it like menthol, yarrow,fennel and mint."
Better than chips or popcorn!,"These are light to eat, lower in fat and sodium than most chips.  And you won't chip your teeth on hard kernels as in popcorn.  I like the white cheddar and kettle flavors the best.  So  glad I can get them at a great price through Amazon.  I am considering sending a case to special friends for birthdays or holidays!"
You know it's Fall when Pumpkin Spice latte appears,"I cheer every year, even if it is still 102 degrees and I see that Starbucks is offering pumpkin spice latte.  The only thing I don't cheer about is the price for this addictive habit.  Now, I can make a pumpkin spice latte that ALMOST tastes like the ones a barrista makes and I don't have to leave a tip!  This flavored coffee has very good  flavors, especially of nutmeg but cinnamon and cloves are in there too.  Like all these coffees, using really hot water and stirring for at least a minute, makes a better cup and prevents the bottom of the cup residue.  This is a light coffee, not a strong robust one so don't think it is going to wake you up in the morning if you did something the night before you shouldn't have!  But it is very nice mid-day or evening treat and won't keep you awake unless you are sensitive to small amounts of caffeine.  You don't really want to serve it with dessert because it is too much like dessert itself but some vanilla flavored cookies go nicely with it."
I really enjoy this,"This has a very rich chocolate/caramel flavor.  It's delicious.  I find it's not too sweet at all, just a very smooth true caramel flavor. I got a sample of this in the mail and was pleasantly surprised at how good this is.  I'm not even a coffee drinker.  And I don't usually like instant flavored coffee beverages of this typel I couldn't taste much if any coffee flavor.  This tasted to me more like hot cocoa mixed with caramel and cream.  I was expecting it to be too sweet for my taste but it wasn't.  Very good, and highly recommended.<br />I am at this moment preparing to buy more of this here on Amazon since I didn't find it at my local store."
Love this tea,Great tea and at a great price. Shipping was fast. I will probably buy this tea again. What I like best is it is caffeine free yet it has a lot of flavor.
The taste was AWFUL!,"I bought this thinking that I would be getting a scaled down version of real coconut water, boy was I wrong! What I got was a very sweet, artificial flavored coconut drink that left me feeling as those I had just drank Hawaiian Tropic tanning oil! I still get a little queasy thinking about it. I am a big fan of Sobe drinks but this one missed the mark by a mile!"
Very Good!,"The tea taste is very good, I've taken it yesterday for the first time. I'm taking it because of my pregnancy, many friends told me about its precious toning for the uterus."
Great seasoning,I love this seasoning and use it almost everyday. So much cheaper than in the stores. I hope Amazon continues to sell Goya products.
Delicious,This is the best dried hummus I've found.  It has a mild flavor and thus can be mixed with a variety of spices for a customized taste.
boy these are some tasty nuts !!,Ive had some tasty nuts before but these are exceptionaly good. try them ! im very happy with this product
Misleading Serving Size,"This review applies to most, but not all of Dr. MacDougalls' Instant soup mixes that come in a cup, to which you just add the enclosed packet and hot water. The problem is that these containers hold 2 servings. How is that supposed to work? How do you keep the second half of the prepared soup? Especially when at work - no kitchen here. Also when you look at the nutrition label, it is for only 1/2 the contents of the cup. There is a line hidden away, if you look hard enough that says the nutrition info is for "".50% "" of container. This should be much more prominently displayed. However,some of the varieties do only hold 1 serving, but the pictures all look the same."
Great tasting protein bars,These bars are great for people that have had gastric bypass surgery. Very good and they don't leave an after taste. I buy these all of the time now.
Nice product!,Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. The product was shipped very fast as well and it was well packaged.
Awesome granola!,"I find it humorous that people would reduce their star rating for a product on Amazon over the price (see other reviews).  I love this brand, I've been eating it since I was a kid along with a good selection of other cereals. It's crunchy and a naturally sweet and the raisins sticking to your teeth once in a while is part of the enjoyment.  Think of it as burning calories while you chew.  This is definitely a top favorite for me.<br /><br />Costco may have a better price but they won't drop it off at my door, and I hate fighting with the lineups in that huge store.  Shopping for groceries on Amazon is extremely convenient."
My cats best friend,"I was looking for a cat food without grains, and read the reviews on this line of cat food. So I took a chance and ordered it hoping my cats would like it. YES they do. I have 2 male cats one 12 yrs and one 7 yrs. The 7 year old has IBS and vomits most cat food up. He has not vomited this up once. (YEAH!) My older cat eats this and leaves most of the Fancy Feast I put in their bowls. I am so glad I found this as I believe that the grains and fruits they put in cat food is not good for them."
I love these little things!,"I recently bought these from Uwajimaya, a store in the International District of Seattle for 1.99. I love trying new things from there, so I bought them and I am in love with them! I can't wait to try the other flavours. I'm so glad that they're good for you. They're filling too, I don't feel like I have to eat 5 to get my sugar fix. I'm glad Amazon sells them if I can't get out to Seattle! Remember to shake them before freezing, cos they can separate."
It's perfect,"It's a cat liter scoop.  Very pedestrian chore, but one that none of us wants to make any more difficult.  This scoop is large and sturdy.  It makes scooping clumping cat litter very easy. It fits well in the hand.  The deep basket means the clumps stay in the basket when you're moving from litter box to garbage bag.<br /><br />What more can I say?  If you need a cat litter scoop this one is inexpensive, durable and well designed."
"great cereal, but too expensive online yet","I think pack of 4 for $25.00 is too much ($6.25 per box). I got them in Target for less than $3.00 sometimes. Also, maybe because of promotion, I got them for $2.80 or around that at Safeway. I will not buy this one online. TASTE is FIVE STARS, but price is ONE STAR."
I have never seen anything like it!,"Gross!  Efficient!  I bought the smaller size and it was completely filled in 2 days and making maggots!  YUCK!  If you want something that works, buy this.  In fact, buy a few.  They are cheap and worth it.  I am now purchasing the larger size."
No bargain,"I agree with the first reviewer.  I can get the same 12-pack from a local grocery for under $3.00.  This is a rip-off, pure and simple."
Potential fire hazard,"I'm a sucker for convenience, but with two kids and a job - do you really blame me? I'm the stereotypical busy mom, and I thought these would be great. I bought the popcorn in early August but quickly forgot about it as we moved into the fall months. While cleaning our pantry, I re-discovered them.<br /><br />Today I thought it would make a great addition to my lunch. I went to the break room, popped it on and waited patiently.<br /><br />It was still popping when I pulled out, but it just smelled burnt.<br /><br />To my surprise, it was. Not only that, but the bag had sprung a leak. Unpopped kernels and butter leaked out. Had I let it go the full 2 minutes, we would have been facing a massive fire. Cleaning the microwave after that was bad enough, but having to deal with the possible problems it could have caused? Even worse.<br /><br />I've only used one bag, but I'm throwing the rest of the box away. A fire hazard isn't worth it."
Solo is oh so good!,"Solo bars are so delicious, especially the Lemon Lift flavor.  I grab one on the go at lunch time and it keeps me going until dinner.  One of the best bars of this type I have ever had.  I am a fitness trainer and I recommend them to my clients of which some are diabetics and they love the Solo bars.  They do not experience the sugar spike and drop like with other bars or like candy bars.  Great product!"
WE LOVE IT!  More nutrient dense food for our dogs! They LOVE IT!,"I spent ALOT of time researching dogfood, and although we wanted a quality food, we just couldn't see spending over a hundred a month on their food.  So, I researched the researchers' recommendations and was happy to find this rated highly and up with the more expensive brands.  The name so cute that I would have bypassed it as just an advertising gimmick to appeal to sentimentally inclined customers  but the recommendation on a very picky dog food analysis site impressed me.<br />  We've found it to be very nutrient dense...the dogs need less to feel and look great.  They actually gained weight on it, and we had to cut back.  We have an AUSSIE and a MINIATURE POODLE we adopted. (We still can't believe we have this small poodle dog...but she is a terrier in her heart and has plenty of energy to keep up with the Aussie. We let her original owner (family)take her once a week for sleepovers which she loves.) She was on the Chicken Soup for puppies and she took off on this, and is actually large for her breed.<br />  Their coats are dense and great shape, eyes are bright, and skin great. No ear infections, allergies, or teeth scale buildup. We had an Airedale that had horrible allergies for which we tried everything from the vet.  Finally, put him on flaxseed and omega-3 fish oil tablets, and we got him off the cortisone.  This food seems to have the oils and nutrients for good health maintenance.<br />They love their food...always excited to eat it.  My husband says they just can't wait to dig into it.  They love it so much that we keep some in a little canister used for treats during the day. They think a kibble is a BIG deal.  Who are we to argue?  Also, we've never had it get stale smelling or off smelling like other more natural dog foods.<br />  This is our 3rd order, and we'd love to see it become an item that you can have sent on schedule plan so we could save even more.<br />I could be a spokesman for this food! I only wish we could had known of it for all our other adopted dogs:  Irish Setter, Standard Schnauzer, Airedale.  They would have loved it."
The Best Decaf Out There,"Because a kind soul brought her Keurig into work, I got to try Timothy's Columbian decaf.  The coffee doesn't have any of the after taste associated with decaf.  It just tastes like a smooth cup of coffee. After my colleague took her machine home, I craved another cup of that coffee.  So, I bought a Keurig and began searching for the best price I could get on Timothy's Columbian Decaf.  Thank you Amazon for making this 50 pack offer.  The deal is even better if you ""subscribe and save."""
My cat's favorite,"My cat is very, very picky when it comes to eating  food that he doesn't kill himself!  He loves this, pushes the peas away, but then, later goes back and eats them.  Go figure!"
Great drink!,"I was introduced to this product by a friend from CA and found it to be something I have enjoyed for some time.  It is easy to prepare, and on cold evenings, a joy to share.  I highly recommend to anyone who prefers good taste and - one of the best points-- it is healthy if you don't need the sugar!"
It's water.,"On the bottle's label is the statement ""Doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health."" The vagueness of that statement--does it mean that one doctor recommended Essentia as opposed to any other water? Or perhaps that doctors in general acknowledge what everyone knows, namely that water is essential to life?--amused me. There are a variety of claims on the label and at Essentia's website (including a testimonial by a ""Dr. G.N."" from Wisconsin), but it turns out that Essentia is just municipal tap water that's gone through a variety of processes designed, apparently, to provide electrolytes and improve hydration.<br /><br />I'm not in a position to judge these claims, though having reading books such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN3G4"">Bottlemania</a> and seen shows such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00019PDNY"">Penn & Teller's</a> show about bottled water, I am somewhat dubious of claims regarding bottled water. So I did an informal test. I filled three bottles with water: one with this product, one with simple tap water from my kitchen sink, and one with purified water from a generic brand. I put the three bottles into the refrigerator (with little pieces of paper taped to the bottom indicating the source), and shuffled them every day for two weeks until I was--or believe I was--unaware of the provenance of each bottle's contents.<br /><br />The results: A virtual dead heat. I could tell that one of the bottles (the Essentia, as it turned out) was slightly different. There was a slight aftertaste. It wasn't unpleasant, just there. But before I looked at the identities, I did rank the bottles. Tap water won. Essentia was second. And the purified water was third. Oddly, it tasted rather plastic and was the only one that did so despite the fact that all of the bottles were identical. (They were empty bottles of that same water.)<br /><br />In the end, though, I noticed no benefits of superior hydration or the additives. I simply tasted water that was slightly different from two others. Of course, my test wasn't scientific. It wasn't double-blind, though I tried hard to make it as close as possible. It represents, for what it's worth, my experience."
Yum!,"This is a fast, easy, tasty curry fix.  It's may be a little spicy for some people.  I'd rate it 2.5 stars on a four star hotness scale.<br /><br />I like it best made with boneless chicken thighs, but chicken breasts/tenders are OK (if a bit more dry.)  Cut the chicken into 1-2 inch pieces and throw it in the pot with the curry mixture.  You'll have 3-4 tasty meals in about twenty minutes.  I like to serve it over rice, but naan is fine.  Leftovers are good too.<br /><br />Personally, I'd rate it 4-1/2 stars, but that wasn't an option.  I eat this 3-4 times a month.<br /><br />Their other dishes are nice too, but this is my favorite."
best honey masque ever!,"This honey is great, I've used it in my tea, which tastes great, and I also sometimes just take a little half tbsp and it really helps with my digestion.  I use it as a skin care product, A layer on my face and wait about 20 minutes then rinse.  I've also mixed it with himalayan pink salt crystals and made an exfoliating mask.  My skin is much less irritated.  I have had acne and itchy skin for years, this honey feels like heaven on my skin."
Not good,"I ordered the 10 oz crab cakes.  Usually you expect a shell or so, but not in EVERY bite.  The 'lump' was not all lump meat either.  These were a great disappointment. The flavor is fine, but I would never order these again.  I have found G&M crab cakes to be true lump and much better than these."
Good - but expensive,"My daughter found this product on Amazon, after the purchase was done, I found the same product at another website for about 1/3 the price.  Shop this product around, you can probably do better, too."
"Great selection of coffee, but maybe I got lucky?!?!",This was a great selection of coffee that I managed to pick up at a great price ($16.49).  It contains most every Bold variety with just a few repeated.  I prefer the bolds but for some they may be very strong and overwhelming so make sure to check into it if this is the first time.  THEY also work great if you like to add ice to your coffee as it doesn't get weak/watery.  At the regular price it isn't anything special but if you watch the price and can get it for cheap this is a great selection to fill up your stock.  The dates on them were all into mid-August or later and I received in mid-June (2 months).  Another thing seems to be how the assortment works out.  I only received 7 Decafs and 28 Regular :)
Beware of the dust,"I bought a large bag of Celluclay for my children's school projects.  It has come in handy.  It stores well and is as easy to mold as Play-doh.  Depending on the size of the projects, the 5 pound bags will last a long time.<br /><br />My son's first project was to make an Indian grinding hole, which was basically a rock with a hole.  This was easy and quite authentic looking.  His next project is to cover a newspaper doll.  His classmate used paper mache and he's using Celluclay.<br /><br />A few things to remember and consider: Don't add too much water or the project will take forever and a day to dry.  My son's rock took more than a week to dry.  Also, mix it outside and use a dust mask.  It is extremely lightweight and powdery.  I made the mistake of not using a dust mask the first time I mixed it and accidentally inhaled the dust.  It's awful.  No matter how carefully water is added and how slowly it is mixed, the dust is everywhere.  I think there ought to be a warning label.  My lungs are still suffering the after effects."
Great Taste & Qualtiy,Ito En teas are a great source of antioxidants. I love this flavor in particular because it has a great taste without any sweeteners at all! When tea tastes this good you don't need other ingredients.
Omaha Steaks 8 (12 oz.) Private Reserve Ribeyes,"Well, Grandpa made out like a king this Christmas.  Grandma bought him some Omaha Steaks (12 oz. ribeyes) and I must tell you that they are delicious!  Gramps shared his steaks with Grams and we had a delightful dinner.  There are six more for him to enjoy and there's not a piece of fat anywhere on them.  They cook even better on the George Foreman grill that went with them as a second gift (also purchased through Amazon.com -- thank you).  It's so easy to clean and he was like a little kid waiting for Santa to finally bring the gifts this year.  Of course, I made out like a bandit this year also, so now we're both flat broke.<br /><br />Who cares?  We have our health, our children and grandchildren, and we have each other for the past 44 years.  Who could ask for anything more?  Thanks to Amazon.com for making our Christmases so special!!"
Great cookies!,"Absolutely the best gluten free cookie going! The best part is, they are soft and chewey instead of dry and crumbly like most GF cookies."
Tree nut contamination,"I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find that this product is produced on machinery that is shared with tree nuts. As someone with allergies to peanuts and tree nuts, it would be helpful and responsible if companies that purport to look out for consumers by bandying about the organic label would list this allergen information on their sale page."
Not real impresed with this thing.,"It might be just this one flavor, since the other flavors seem to be getting good reviews. My bowl popped, but the bottom layer of popcorn was burnt. I was paying attention, too. I followed the instructions on the bag to the letter. The unburnt kernels on the top came out fluffy and coated in a butter that I am absolutely positive is not good for me (tasted good, though). Another caveat, though: when I went to rip off the plastic film, it did not pull off like magic as in the ads. The right side came up, then I had to fight with the left side (but carefully, so as not the rip off the entire side of the bowl). Then I had the ""bowl,"" which is shaped uncomfortably like an upside down paper hat from a fast food joint. On the whole, the popcorn that came out right was tasty, but I'd still rather pop it on the stove and then dump it into a mixing bowl myself."
Ok for an expensive treat; not for a supplement,"Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere."
Tastes like licking a charred raspberry,"Imagine you took a raspberry, drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and then put it on a frying pan.  You turned on the frying pan and let it sizzle for about 3 or 4 hours.  Put that in a coffee filter and brew it.  Sound good?  I didn't think so.  Thats what this coffee tastes like to me.  I bought a double pack, and I don't like it.  I tried to like it, and even gave it a second shot.  I wish I knew what to do with the rest of it, but I wouldn't subject my friends to this, so I can't give it to them."
blk cherry juice,"Good product of high quality for a very good price, just as advertised. This product is very hard to find in grocery stores, thus this made it very convenient."
Fabulous Green Tea,"Tazo Zen green tea with lemongrass is an absolutely wonderful tea. The lemongrass moderates the slight bitterness that is common in plain green tea. I've experimented with adding a twist of lemongrass to a plain organic green tea, and the flavor is similar. The lemongrass complements the green tea flavor, deletes any hint of bitterness, and contributes a very faint lemon scent and flavor that can't be duplicated with ordinary lemon. I drink other green teas (for example, Tazo's decaf Lotus at night, or Tazo's jasmine when I'm in that flowery jasmine mood), but Zen is far and away my favorite. And, no, I don't own stock in the company!"
The ONLY flavor that makes sense...,"This is just my opinion, but whoever thought to use peppermint as a flavor for menthol cough drops was a pure, simple genius! The peppermint compliments the medication so well, these not only WORK better than any other flavor, but they actually TASTE decent too - like a really strong breath mint.<br /><br />Cough drops, by nature, are going to taste minty one way or another, so why fight it?<br /><br />Usage suggestion: Smash one so it'll dissolve quicker and stir the pieces into some hot chocolate. The result is a great mint-chocolate flavor and a cup of cocoa that will help ANY sore throat."
Stale,"I send this produce to my mother in NM.  The first couple of shipments were great.  The last one, all 3 boxes were stale.<br />I will be cancelling the order."
One of the best...,"The name is not very exciting, but don't let that deter you from tyring it. It is a great cup of coffee. It is not overly strong but absolutely not weak. No bitterness and no aftertaste. It has some very subtle flavors that I can't quite identify and that makes it a unique experience. This is one of my ""go to"" blends and I keep more of it on hand than the other varieties."
Tough to find,"I'm not sure why Kraft is so selective with where they sell this product. It use to be readily available at any store. The product is used for homemade mac and cheese recipe.  The product is great, although a bit pricey by the vendor. I highly recommend this product."
"Fabulous coffee, ridiculous price","Our local Costcos stopped carrying this brand. I went online to try to find some. Ouch! Now $48 for 4 pounds. Guess we will do without. If price is no issue and you want excellent coffee, this is one of the best we have tried. It has a wonderful richness, smooth, non-bitter, all around excellent coffee. If I had to pay $12 a pound for coffee, I guess this is the one I would choose. But for now, I'll keep looking."
overpriced and melted,"These are super delicious, and I really like the attempt to be more wholesome.  But kind of a rip-off, and mine all came melted and reformed into a giant ball!!  Gross... the canola oil is more noticeable like that"
Great but then,"I have ordered theses Vermont Style Fleecy Dog Toys frequently.  Up until the last order I was very pleased.  In the last order, two of three toys, per package, did not have the seem closed and I had to sew each up before I could give one to my dog."
Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."
classic candy,I remember buying these at a local store as a kid for a penny apiece. Now a theater box is around a buck and has 16 fish in it. Inflation sucks but I still grab a box once in a while for a little pick me up.
Not bad,I like orange juice. It makes me energized in the morning and it really got me healthier than usual. It's nice to give it for kids who go out and play. Buy this.
Yummy & Crumbely,"These bars are a must for anyone with hypoglycemia. I eat one before I go to bed and viola, no more night sweats and terrors. The apple tastes delicious (actually all the flavors I've tried do) but falls apart easily. So, expect pieces to fall off while eating. I also recommend Glucose Tablets to people with hypoglycemia. I've only tried the Target brand and raspberry is the best."
25 lb. bag Pamela's Bread Mix,This is a great product.  Now in a large bag it's more economical than ever.  It's so versatile.
terrible,"The taste of all the flavors is disgusting. If you want sparkling water, try the Sparkling Ice, Black Raspberry. It is delicious."
Finally a great healthy snack that my girls love!,"I recently tried the Grilled Cheese Puffs and thought they were great. The biggest test they had to pass was whether my 2 and 6 year girls would eat them. They LOVED them.  They got a great cheesy taste (like Cheeto's), but their hands didn't get dirty and it was much healthier.  The 4 ounce bags come PACKED to the top with puffs!  I bought some for kid's friends and they also loved them.  Definitely try them!"
Bad taste,"This product is sweetened with Splenda, and tastes very artificial. Maybe if you like diet soda you will like this, but the 3 people that sampled it did not."
It's got a Ginger twist,"I love having Ginger Ale to drink especially when my stomach isn't feeling well so I tried to purchase this and see how I would like it. It was nothing like I imagined it to taste like. It has a real taste to the actual ginger root and I was highly disappointed because it was nothing like what I expected especially with all the positive reviews. So Buyer Beware that this product has that ginger root taste to it. And now I am stuck with the bulk that I purchased, so I'll look into giving it away to friends who may enjoy it.<br /><br />I got this sadly comment back from some bored person:<br />Nowhereman says:<br /><br />Six of your eight reviews are one star. Perhaps it is merely poor judgment in purchasing decision making. Maybe you need to see someone for Postpartum depression. Any attempt at defensive rebuttal might help provide insight into the psychological origins of this hostility and help a professional to diagnose if you need education or treatment. Run, don't walk to caregivers. They can help you sort it out as I am uniquely unqualified to pinpoint the exact nature of the problem. It would not hurt to take English as a second language in either case.<br /><br />My take on your reply to my review: TOO BAD, if you don't like what you read you are free to move on. I don't post reviews for entertainment purposes as you seem to be evaluating and insulting comments posted. Before you judge someone from a petty post of review please keep in mind it does not give you the person's lifestyle nor psychological origins. I work in the medical field so if anyone needs help that is for you to seek, I also have two special needs children so please education does run deep in this household. Keep your comments to yourself. Sadly after what you have posted it's obvious you are in need of some Jesus and the love you lack in life. God Bless!"
carbonated juice beats sodas,"This drink is a nice blend of juices (mostly orange) and carbonated water.  There are no other ingredients.  It has a decent amount of natural sugars from the juice, so it is not a low-calorie drink.  I thought the balance of flavors and sweetness was quite nice and would definitely buy again."
excellent and filling little bar!,"I first bought Lara bars at a local grocery store, drawn by the idea of a bar that was nothing more than fruits and nuts. No additives. No added sugar. Yum!<br /><br />I was pretty pleased by the taste of my first purchases, and I liked these a lot, too.<br /><br />The taste of these is a bit tart (it's lemon, after all), but sweet at the same time.<br /><br />The texture is very soft, but with the tiny crunch of minced nuts.<br /><br />Excellent!"
Fantastic,"The most exceptional tea, meticulously packaged and labeled, produced and shipped in a timely manner, at a price that works for me. The new technology used for the wraps (Biopack) keeps the coca tea fresh until the last bag consumed, It is a safe biodegradable and I love the idea of ""Environmentally Friendly Packaging"" ... So far my favorite!<br />I wish the Private Reserve ( Amber color) Flour was still available; I am patiently waiting for next year production."
Our dog loves these.....,"When we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldn't.  Looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts.  Taste is awful.  Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food."
curry paste,"we love this stuff....all their flavors.  i mix one of these with lots of quinoa, wild rice or brown rice or mung bean noodles and veggies.  1 3.5 box is quite spicy so mixed it's great flavor."
A tasty snack for the health conscious,"I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar. Most foods that advertise themselves as a ""healthy"" snack are not really all that good for you. Often they are too high in calories or they use products that you just shouldn't eat. This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG. They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber. (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious. They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip. The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat. I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip. I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out. I tried the Buffalo flavor and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected. I still like them, but not as much as the plain.  I really enjoy eating the Multigrain with a little lowfat queso!"
Great for mac and cheese!,"If your recipe calls for shells for mac and cheese, be SURE to grab these!  They hold any sauce exceptionally well, and just have that perfect consistency you're seeking in your recipes.  I've been using these for years and seldom buy anything else.  They cook up well, and do not turn mushy or pasty in the dish. You can certainly believe the commercials for this product. Highly recommend!"
Multiples for real heat,"These are exquisite. As others have mentioned, they are quite possibly the best picked sausage on the market. They are still sold in some California stores but are becoming almost impossible to find. I started buying all that I could find, due to their increasing rarity.  Their heat is perfect. One is not too hot, and the taste is great. Taste's better quality meat than the slushy types. It doesn't taste ""mushy"". That's a big plus. If you want real heat, eat multiples. Three or four of these will leave your mouth burning, and some level of regret the next day, but individually, always worth it and a great snack.  I've just added them to my wish list, so I can always find them in future. :D"
Sweet Hot is exactly that,"Definitely a moister, kippered-style jerky.  Not the ultra dry kind that makes your teeth hurt.  I can see why some might find it too ""oily"", as I have found brands like that before.<br /><br />But it definitely works here, at least with the Sweet and Hot.  I haven't tried the other flavors.<br /><br />And it's not too sweet or too hot.  Kinda like a Chinese spare rib, without the bone.  I'd buy more."
tasty but too expensive on Amazon!,buy this stuff all the time but I'm not sure why anyone buys it off Amazon because it is $4.17 a box here and its $2.00 a box at Walmart??
NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!,"This stuff tastes really, really good. My only complain: Not enough paneer bits! But I am obsessed with paneer so this opinion is to be expected. It has the right amount of veggies and such in it and a very wonderful taste. It goes really well with Jasmine rice, which is how I eat it. It was a very good purchase on sale. If you like Indian food, this is a very good brand to buy."
great for a pick me up,I love these drinks they are a good alternative.  Finally got me off a mountain dew habit from the 80's.  Also can be used to make a glass of beer totally turn to foam instantly :)
Great chips,"I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through."
SOOOOOOOOO GOod!,"OMG....these are so good, better than I thought, they actually do taste home made, and I gotta say they taste even better than my grandmothers, sorry grams...:) I will definetly try these again, I got lucky and got to try a delicious sample from the influenster team :) I love quaker, and influenster.com"
convenient and delicious,"totally satisfied with these delicious flakes. great taste; fresh, tangy, and a robust onion flavor."
Super fresh raisins,"Sadaf Golden Raisins are the freshest raisins I've ever eaten. I highly recommend them, in fact I plan to put this product on a schedule delivery."
So good - tastes like sushi without the fish.,"I am addicted to sushi, which is an expensive addiction.  I always keep a tin of these at work and at home to satisfy the craving.  My boyfriend, who doesn't like sushi, really enjoys these too, so they aren't just for sushi lovers.  I believe they are roasted, so they are not as healthy as raw almonds, but they still make a great afternoon snack."
Good chips with an occasional bad aftertaste,"These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous. Most of the time, the chips tasted quite good, but every now and then I'd get one with this somewhat bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Besides that, I would definitely buy these again."
Only one can?,"It says ""Pack of 2"" in the text and photo. Yet they sent me one can. They added a comment in the receipt: ""price is for ONE canister,"" as if they could change their minds after I placed my order.<br /><br />I've inquired and will report back what happens. If they send me another can, I'll change this to five stars. But it would be insane to pay for $20 for one can of cocoa, when it's $12 retail."
Nice snack--and good for you!,"One of my Amazon friends reviewed this product recently and sent me into a state of shame and guilt.  This is the kind of thing I ought to drink fairly regularly.  It's healthy and it tastes pretty good.  But the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and I tend to drink this for awhile--and then forget about it.<br /><br />Well, after having been shamed, I bought some of this just a short while ago.  And, yum, it tastes pretty good!  I've started having this as a part of a low calorie lunch. High levels of Vitamin C. It tastes pretty good!  I forget why I get out of the habit!<br /><br />The only downside that I see is that the sodium level is a bit high--but not as bad as with a lot of processed foods (take a look at canned soups!).<br /><br />So, I'm trying to begin the habit of having this regularly.  How long will it be before I get out of the habit??"
Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuccino,The coffee is wonderful with no bitter taste or after taste. I prefer a Cappucino style of coffee with all ingredients pre mixed. This is one of the best that I have tried and I know I will be re-ordering when I am done with my original purchase.
Canidae Dog Treats,"The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios.  The ""snap"" configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want.  I liked the nutritional content of the treats.  So many times the dogs may love the treats but they are not the healthiest for them.  These treats are good for them and they love them.....  I have switched my dogs to the Canidae dog food as well....."
Love this product,"Our family started using coconut oil as a replacement for butter.  I have made gluten free biscuits, scones, granola bars, pie crusts, cookies and breads with this brand and love it's versatility.  I have had other brands 'bake out' of my foods, but this one acts like butter when baking.  I like the taste, and I am not a coconut enthusiast.  I also use it to make a natural sugar scrub for the shower, lotion bars and for moisturizing bath salts.  This is the best price I have found, especially with the free shipping.  The health benefits of this oil are just a bonus for our family, it makes baking gluten/dairy/egg free much easier and tastier!!"
My cat likes it,My human roommate actually tasted it and he says it tastes terrible and his fish's food tastes a lot better. My cat likes it though and has prefers it over Friskies wet cat food.
An All Natural Winner,"Though I like to try and use all natural foods, I will not sacrifice flavor just to ""go natural"". From the 1st mini-chip to the last in one of the 1 oz snack-sized bags, I was entirely satisfied and will definitely buy these. I started eating the chips plain and, from the 1st bite, found the multigrain flavor satisfingly strong with a just a hint of sweetness that took the edge off the grain flavor. The size and shape of the chips (more like crackers than larger tortilla chips) was good for snacking, plus the thickness provided just the right texture and ""crunch"" factor.<br /><br />Later I finished the chips with a pesto dip and the complementary flavors worked perfectly: the chip didn't over power the dip, but neither did it roll over and die. I am sure I would enjoy these tortilla chips with other dips.<br /><br />Finally a last observation is how well these mini-chips kept their original shape. Out of the entire (albeit small) bag, only 1-2 chips were broken.<br /><br />An all natural winner that will have a permanent spot on my households snack-food roster."
tastes great,Packaged well item tastes great can be messy when you attempt to eat that clif bar falls apart. However I want more of this product.
Best I have tried of the exploding soups,"I have found that the Healthy Choice soups are not a good soup for the microwave.  Of all I tried this one is the best, it only explodes or jumps around a little bit, and usually no mess results if you wrap the container in paper towels.  Something in the Healthy Choice soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues.  I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel.  Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave.  This rice based soup recipe does not seem to have as severe of a problem as some of the other recipes I have tried."
Garbage,Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
Great Product.,"Came nicely packaged, fresh, timely fashion.  Very yummy.  If you love getting 5-6 of these around Halloween... wait till you get a tub of 240. =|"
Best stuff for grilled salmon,"My local gourmet grocery USED to carry this product - which is how I got hooked.  My parents also love this rub - it's super consistent - skin the salmon, brush with butter and add the rub - grill and eat.  I ordered the 16 oz tub for my dad as a Christmas gift - it was probably his favorite thing I got for him.  If you've not tried it before, buy the smaller tub - but my guess is you'll be back for the 16oz!"
"One, two, chai, chai, chai!","The India Spice Chai is delicious!  I usually buy the Chai Latte (which I love), but decided to try the Chai tea.  This is not a creamy drink like the Chai Latte.  It is a regular tea.  The spice blend is delicious.  The aroma is divine!  Try this, you won't be sorry."
Awesome Tea,I bought this Tea for my girlfriend who is ery health conscious. So far she is loving it and it tastes good too. :)
"Good to help with ""Sleeping""","I bought this originally to replace peanut butter, but nope I can not give up the PB for this yet. I did keep for use at night I was told that if you have a spoonful at night it levels out something in your system & helps you sleep better. If you bought it give it a try, it can't hurt to try. It texture is not smooth like peanut butter, but more like fine chopped up nuts. Not my favorite texture, but not bad on a spoon either. I did give it a try & I did sleep better that night at least. I will continue to try at night to see what happens. I have chronic insomnia & have had it for years. I will be back in the future to leave you an update. (If anyone has a good suggestion for safe effective sleep tips please leave me a comment!) Thank you and Good Eating to all!!!"
surprisingly flavorful,"I didn't expect to like this coffee since it's a medium roast and I'm a bold roast person.  However, I found it flavorful and strong.<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold"
Look out if you are sensitive to caffeine,"I purchased this beverage at costco, and took about 3 sips.  It hit my stomach like a bomb and I didn't sleep well for about 48 hours.  I became VERY dehydrated within 2 hours, had heart burn, and muscle spasms.  Then when the effect wore off on the second day, my joints ached and I felt like I'd been in a car accident.  I would never buy or use this product again."
Fog chaser is better!,"The San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count was a great value. This is my second time buying the SFB brand. I like the Fog Chaser much better and will stick with that one next time!"
so yummy in a smoothie,"These taste really great in smoothies! They add a creamy texture and a bit of a nutty flavor. What a great way to add protein to a veggie diet! Love them. They arrived fresh and packed nicely. If I ever run out of my 3 lb, I will order again from this seller."
Satisfaction after 30 days!,"I have owned several of these SAECO machines in Europe and everyone, including this machine, purchased from Amazon in the USA, have exceeded expectations.  They are reliable, simple to operate and produce great coffees!"
Great for pets that don't like to take pills.,"We have used the beef, chicken and the peanut butter Pill Pockets, we tried hot dogs before, but our dog would eat the hot dog and spit out the pills.  We tried the pill poctets and he actually ate the whole thing.  Great product."
Fiber Rich and Tasty,"This is a great product- I add it to rice, soups, veggie mixes or anything to boost the fiber content.  The texture is yummy, too.  Highly recommend these berries as a way of adding whole grains and fiber to your diet."
Wicked good,"These are awesome. And good for you to boot. Sure there's probably a little too much salt, but everything in moderation, right..."
Very Good Teas - Highly Recommended,"We bought the Celestial Seasonings K-Cup Tea Sampler for use in our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. Here are my observations:<br /><br />There are two boxes, each containing -<br /><br />* English Breakfast Black Tea; A very rich tea that works well in both small and large cup brew sizes<br />* Lemon Zinger; A very pleasant caffeine free tea that is perfect for winding down after work, I like it brewed on large cup<br />* Green Tea; A good tasting traditional Green Tea that is somewhat strong when brewed on the small cup setting<br />* Sleepy Time Herbal; Another caffeine free tea that is smooth and relaxing and, as the name suggests, perfect for bedtime<br /><br />This is an enjoyable selection of teas that come out nice in the single serving K-Cups.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
Easiest way to give your dog glucosamine,"Having a golden retriever with allergies, I have tried so many products.  Zukes does not set off the allergies and gives my girl what she needs now that she is getting older.  She moves better now."
Pleasant tasting water,"I conducted a blind taste test between 4 different waters:  tap water, tap water filtered through a Brita filter, a popular bottled water, and this product.  All of the waters were at room temperature. Not surprisingly, the tap water tasted the worst.  The bottled water was next, and I would say that this water tied with the Brita filter water for good taste.  The Essentia water tasted ""softer"" (similar to Evian), but with a better flavor. It has a little after-taste which I presume is related to the minerals.  I can't evaluate any health benefits because I've only tried the product for a few days, but I'll update this review if I notice anything.  Bottom line-- at home I'll still probably use Brita-filtered water because it's less expensive, but when buying water at the store or needing bottled water for any reason, this is an excellent choice and better-tasting than typical bottled water."
Good enough for me!,I like a bolder coffee than my husband does and this one is good enough for me. It leaves a pleasant after-flavor. I am impressed also with the design of the cups. I'd certainly order it again.
I love this flavor,"My department at work has a Keurig machine and drinking Jamaica Me Crazy while at work had me craving some coconut goodness on my off time.  I chose the Green Mountain Island Coconut for the price value but also because I've never been disappointed with Green Mountain.  This blend was not an exception.  The coconut taste is wonderful without being too mild or too overpowering.  For me, this has been a great blend from Green Mountain. Much like their blueberry coffe, I will continue to buy the Island Coconut throughout the season."
Awesome stuff!,"I love this! I do not buy it here, but at the store. I like it on pizza of course. But I also like to eat it right out of the container it comes in!  It's good on crackers by itself or with cheese, on hot dogs, in soup & pasta dishes. It is a little drier than other products I've tried. But that is ok, because I don't like peporoni that is too greasy. This product also does not give me heartburn & many of the others do. I like the product! GOOD!!"
Fantastic Salt,"I got this for work, as I am a cook. Everyone noticed that I have had a change in the flavors of my food. They said it was a good change. Personally I have enjoyed useing the salt in different foods. I do like it very much."
The best tea in the world (in my opinion),"In my opinion, PG tips make the best tea. ever.<br /><br />However, with all the tea-drinking at my house, I opted for the decaf version and it is every bit as good as the regular.<br /><br />I am a firm believer in the ""pyramid"" shaped tea bags enabling the tea to steep to a full flavor.<br /><br />I drink my tea rather strong with scant milk, but this does make an excellent iced tea, as well."
"Very nice green tea blend, fine flavor, great value","****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****"
Switch things up with this tasty energy drink.,"I've tried other flavors of Switch before, and I think this one (Kiwi Berry) is my favorite. The flavor is much better than Red Bull or Rockstar, which I've consumed my fair share of over the years. It's more like a carbonated fruit drink than an energy drink. I will definitely be purchasing more of these Switch beverages. I like all the flavors I've tried so far. If you are tired of the way energy drinks taste, maybe it's time for you to make the ""Switch""."
great substitute for non-fruit eater pre-schooler,My son doesn't eat much raw fruit so I've tried many dried fruit products - this is his favorite and so easy to put in his lunchbox
Actually really good.,"I had really low expectations for this soup because come on, it's dry soup. But it's actually really good. I made 2 packets in 1 mug because 1 wasn't enough. Even 2 packets (plus water) didn't fill up my mug completely. It's a very light soup with a good flavor. Good tasting noodles, although small, it's great for sipping. I can imagine this being very easy to eat while ill. It's not salty like other reviews claim, it's perfect. Either way I want to eat this soup while reading a good book. I really like this as an easy snack."
Toddler's Favorite!,This is my son's favorite flavor! He gets soo excited when he sees these pouches. They taste like applesauce. Great snack for a hot day. I enjoy them as well- they're not as gritty as some of the other flavors.
Good Balance Of Chocolate And Peanut Butter,"I think I was supposed to receive the Golden Oreo Fudge Creme Cookies, but what I actually received was The Peanut Butter Fudge Creme Cookies, so my review will be based on the peanut butter ones.<br /><br />The packaging was fine, but most of the cookies in my package were not in their individual slots, so quite a few of them had two cookies stuck together, or the cookies were broken.<br /><br />I did enjoy the combination of the smooth peanut butter, balanced with chocolate.  The cookies are thin and crisp.<br /><br />I would definitly buy these cookies again, but in a store.  Maybe products like this are too hard to ship intact.  They did ship is a very large box with air pillows, but I think the cookies got bounced around, so that is probably how they got stuck together, or broken.<br /><br />The cookie package was sealed, but bulging, from the cookies being jostled, so that they couldn't lie in their individual slots.<br /><br />A great cookie, for when you want the taste of peanut butter and chocolate together."
Got to have my Tiger,I was looking for a smooth robust coffee and I have found it with the Black Tiger
delighted,Love the curry and use it in thai dishes.  Give it 5 stars.  I accidently put 2 stars.
Cat food,"This canned cat food is my cat's favorite, and I'm happy to be able to feed it to her. Given what I have read about non-organic cat food, I hope this continues to be available.  She also likes the Newman's organic turkey canned cat food, but that's just her second-favorite."
the best,"This product makes yogurt making a no brainer.  Added benefits - no more non-recyclable containers and I know what is in my yogurt, and how fresh it is.  This starter dissolves easily, has clear instructions and good packaging."
Best Cookie in the World,This is without a doubt the most incredibly addictive packaged cookie in the world. The dark chocolate dipping at one end is a great contrast to the rolled wafer of the cookie itself. Why did I ever buy a whole case! Bless Amazon for carrying the Bahlsen line of fabulous cookies because it is not available in Montana.
a rip off,what a crock. the entire kit can be purchased at walmart for 10.50. won't be buying this plain fudge again.
good deal,"I love this salt. I fill my little shaker with more whenever i need. this salt is more saltier, so you can use a little less. this was a good price."
Tasty Tea,I bought this for my mother who tasted the tea in a restaurant.  This is now her favorite tea.
Simply the Best...,"The Ruth Chris of Cup-Of-Noodles!  This flavorful deluxe bowl of special palm and cottonseed oils, natural MSG, potato starch, beef tallow, and other ingredients, is probably the best tasting high-sodium instant filler-foods out there!  Good for you too!- It has casein- one of the protein building blocks to gaining muscle mass.  The best noodle-flavored sodium product there is; and even though it's got a Korean name, it's made with the ""choicest"" ingredients (they claim) and  made here in the good 'ol U.S. and A.!  This is a perfect precursor to your next New Year's health resolution!  Support our country, and keep your cardiologist working!"
mmm!,"This is a very rich and tasty delight if you enjoy lamb and liver. I prefer it to corn beef hash for flavor. Perfectly seasoned and one can makes several servings, as this haggis is rich in flavor. Try some and this is made in America and does NOT contain any lung tissue like haggis made in Scotland does."
Love this stuff!,"I use coconut oil for everything.  (hair, nails, skin, cooking) My husband laughs at me, but it's great.  Need to order another round."
Jet Fuel Dark Roast,Jet Fuel Dark Roast is currently our favorite of the coffees we have tried.  We like a bold coffee flavor and the Jet fuel Dark Roast meets all expectations.
Awesome toy,"My almost 3 year old loves this toy. She likes to copy my patterns and count the beads. My only complaint is that the colors of my set are way off. The crackers are neon orange and the pretzles are chocolate brown. My daughter doesn't care, but it bothers me, just a little. Otherwise, great value and many hours of fun!"
Tastes good to me,"I was getting sick of the office coffee. (Food catering company generic ground coffee).  I've tried instant coffee like Tasters Choice, and it's extremely weak.  I would have to put twice the suggested amount to make it drinkable, and the taste is still bleh.<br /><br />VIA tastes good, and the Italian roast is nice and strong.  The instructions suggest 8oz of water, I believe.  But I usually put 12oz or a little more of water.  Near the end of the cup, there are still some micro grounds that never dissolved.<br /><br />Overall, good stuff.  Once I finish this 50 pack, I might look into other options, but this one seems pretty good."
Great for weight watchers!,If you like strawberries you'll love Crunchies!  Only 98 calories per pouch - I snacked on one pouch all day and didn't finish it off!  Very convenient- resealable.  I have other varieties on order!
"Works, economical alternative to other 'diet' teas","This stuff works. As reported by real doctors, do not use this all the time, only when needed.  Listen to what your body is telling you."
more pumpkin please!,"First off let me say, You get A LOT of Tea!!!<br />It wasn't as pumkiny as I had hoped it was.<br />Stash usually makes really really good tea's<br /><br />I was sad to read it was decaf, something I didn't notice when I ordered it.<br />o well..<br /><br />still good stuff."
Highly recommended cat food,"I used to work in a specialty pet store, and cats were my specialty. I was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods, reading labels, and talking to customers. I'll share what I learned, and explain why I recommend this food. Science Diet is one of the worst foods for cats, and right down at the bottom you'll also find Purina, Meow Mix, Eukanuba, and Iams. These have by-products, fillers (corn, soybean mill run, corn gluten, grits, or white rice).<br /><br />Many of the better foods like Blue Buffalo, Artemis, Wellness, Instinct, Orijen, California Naturals, Innova Evo, Merrick, and my personal favorite Vet's Choice Health Extension are world's apart in quality and most are cheaper than Science Diet pound for pound in many stores.<br /><br />These are the ingredients for a typical Science Diet bag minus the vitamins/minerals, just to give you an example:<br /><br />Ground Whole Grain Corn, Chicken By-Product Meal, Animal Fat, Dried Beet Pulp, Soybean Oil, Dried Egg Product, Flaxseed.<br /><br />Corn is a filler, and it's the number one ingredient. By products are things like beaks, feathers, etc. They're waste products. The only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list, meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients. Now, let's look at a bag of Health Extension that's both cheaper AND of higher quality:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brown rice, Oats, Dried Egg Product, Chicken Fat, Flaxseed, Menhaden Fish Meal, Herring Oil, Sweet Potato, Cranberries, Blueberries, Tomato Pomace, Natural Barley Malt, Apple Cider Vinegar, Goji Berry, Garlic, Astragalus, Ginger, Blue Green Algae + 6 kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />The potato is a nice binder and good for digestion. The oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in Omegs 3's. The probiotics regulate digestion. The eggs and chicken are good sources of protein. You might not *need* some of the extra ingredients like Goji berry for example, but they're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats.<br /><br />I recommend this food because my cats love it, it's relatively cheap for a quality food, and the ingredients are top-notch. If you want better food, go with Instinct (which my cats love even better, especially the rabbit) but be prepared to pay much more. The absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies, or simply do it yourself if you've researched how to prepare it, but this is an even more expensive route."
"Smooth, but not very vanilla","I don't drink coffee often, but when I do it must be mild to medium roast and very smooooth.  I don't like bold roasts or most flavored coffees. I try to keep a little something different on hand for guests, and figured I couldn't go wrong with Starbucks Vanilla.  I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it's actually pretty good!  In my opinion it tastes less vanilla and more hazelnut, which isn't a bad thing.  I like hazelnut.  That said, the flavor was nicely subtle - just a hint - and did not overpower the coffee flavor.  I was still able to enjoy a medium roast flavor and thankfully it was also very smooth :)"
Great for on-the-go breakfast,Pros:<br />Protein<br />Fiber<br />Filling<br />Tasty<br />Easy for travel<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very crunchy<br /><br />Overall:<br />Delicious and a great fast breakfast
Tried the Sampler Pack.,"Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink."
CESAR DOG FOOD,"i RECEIVED THE SHIPMENT IN GOOD CONDITION AND AM HAPPY FOR THE SPEEDY SHIPMENT. MY WIFES DOG GOES CRAZY OVER THIS STUFF, AND THAT IS A GOOD THING.<br />I DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT ELSE TO WRITE OVER WHAT EVERYONE ELSE KNOWS ALREADY, GOOD STUFF."
Awesome.,"I tried a bunch of the fruity larabar flavors and thought that they were all sickeningly sweet.  Even with the coconut flavor that people seem to love, I could not finish the box.  I just got the chocolate mint jocolate bars and I love them.  I think the coco cuts the sweetness a lot.  I also like the dryer texture of these rather than the sticky texture of the fruit bars.  The same things I like about these bars the one star reviews seem to really dislike, so it seems like it is all about preference.  I don't like things that are super sweet.  I think milk chocolate is gross, and when I eat chocolate I prefer 85% coco or above.  So, maybe those things will be helpful to gauge if you will like these or not."
A great deal!,"This coconut oil is of great quality and the price is great. I paid $10 for an 8-oz jar in the local stores!<br /><br />I love cooking with this product. Scrambled eggs seem to come out very fluffy.<br /><br />I will warn new users to not use coconut oil on very light foods, as the oil does have a slight coconut taste and fragrance. In other foods, the taste disappears completely."
The Best Supplement EVER!!!,"When I read one of the reviews that stated that this supplement changed their life, I was immediately excited because this supplement has changed my life as well!  I started taking this supplement as a part of my diet plan (Ideal Protein).  I took it to help me with bowel movements.  Lucky for me, not only did it improve my bowel movements, it fixed my insomnia problem.  I had insomnia and could not fall into deep sleep for years.  Within 2 weeks of taking this supplement, I was sleeping like a new born baby!  In addition, I became more relaxed and my anxiety completely disappeared!!  It did not stop there...my menstrual cycle is regular now and I no longer have muscle twitches.  TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE!<br /><br />I was soo excited about the improvement in the quality of my life, so I quickly spread the news to all my family and friends.  I worked like wonders for all of my family members.  The results from my friends was a mixed bag.  I think that for the people that have a true magnesium deficiency, this is a miracle supplement.  For those that may not have a true magnesium deficiency, this may not be the magic bullet for them.  I hope that this review was helpful.  I was compelled to spread the word about this supplement because it has truly changed my life!!!"
Relaxing experience everyday,"I have long been an ardent fan of Pacific Chai teas but could no longer find it in the larger cans I liked to keep on hand.  Big Train tea is just as wonderful and relaxing.  The only down side is keeping one's consumption to a couple per day.  Great flavor, mixes easily with hot water.  Love it."
Excellent hot cereal,"This very tasty hot cereal makes a nice alternative to oatmeal and such. With 10 different types of grains, it has more 'depth' than oatmeal, and doesn't get gummy if you cook it a little too long, as oatmeal can do (though you can make it to a porridge-like consistency). And, it goes well with fruit -- fresh, frozen, or dehydrated -- and benefits from adding the sweetener of choice (I like maple syrup, molasses, or honey).<br /><br />I haven't tried making bread with it, but it sounds awesome."
"Couscous, Israeli (5 Lb.)","Fast delivery, Exactly as orderd,will order agin since it's a 200 mile round trip to buy Isareli Couscous."
Love Rihanna - don't love the Tropical taste,"Love Vita Coco - drink them 2x a day for years now - and love the Rihanna connection - but the taste of these is not growing on me. Oh well I'm just a city boy who's sick & tired of ""sports"" drinks with added sugar, no vitamins and made from concentrate. What do I know? Anyway I prefer the plain, peach/melon and tangerine, but will probably skip the Tropical in the future."
Did Not Include Kona as shown,"My husband loves the Kona and I am always looking for a little variety.  I thought this would be perfect, except that when I opened the box, there was no Kona.  Instead there was Tullys Breakfast Blend.  Yes, there was the French Roast.  Yes, there was the Italian Roast.  Yes, there was Tully's special House Blend.  But the 4th variety was NOT Kona, it was Breakfast Blend.  I purchased this from Amazon, and believed the photo.  I should have read the details a little better.  We are very disappointed."
Like Living in Morocco,"Having spent time in Morocco, I had the chance to sample authentic Turkish Delights.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very similar to the real thing<br />- Most types were delicious (I can't say I was a fan of the rose ones)<br />- Not too sugary<br />- Fresh tasting, obviously weren't sitting around in a warehouse<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The rose ones were a bit chalky<br />- So good I ate too many at a time and gave myself a stomach ache!"
cinnammon for health,I Started using  celon cinnamon as a tea before. sleep at nite  my sleep is more rest full .  quality of the product  is superior to others I've tried  I WILL write more later . Rustypots
Great Help for Bad Breath!!,"I tried these on the recommendation of our veterinarian for my 2 little dogs' bad breath. I didn't think they would like them, since the treat is hard & they favor soft treats. But both dogs love them! Within 2 days, their breath was improving. Now, they get their once a day treat to keep their breath smelling fresh."
Great party favor!,"Got these to give the 8 year old boys after coming to my sons video game birthday party. They were a hit.  I was planing on there being colored controllers, after reading on of the other reviews.  But they were all black and white which worked out even getter so no one had to have pink."
Dogs love it!,We have an agressive chewer and so are always looking for a variety of safe chewing items.  This fits the bill.  It takes her a couple of hours to a couple of days to get through it depending on what else is going on. I like that it is meant to be consumed so I don't have to worry about taking pieces away.
Excellent Gelatin Sheets,Works just the way they're suppose to. Worked with powder never sheets great to find something this easy. Thanks for such a good product.
Fiber one 2 point chocolate bars,These are awful....very dry and barely edible. Expected something much better!<br />Hope the birds like them!!! Hope they revamp these brownies.
Oolong Tea,"Do you ever have an upset stomach?  Then this is one product you need to have in your cupboard at all times.  It sooths and helps release excess stomach pressure.  Pretty clever, them Chinese"
Not as strong as previous orders,"I've bought this flavor a number of times before.  This latest order, the coffee simply isn't as strong as previous orders.  In fact, it's absolutely flavorless.  I'm not sure what is wrong with this batch, but it's completely unacceptable."
Great coffee,Love this coffee and ordering from Amazon is extremely convenient.  Can't beat the flavor or the service I get with Amazon.
My Current Favorite Bold and Rich KCup!,Jet Fuel has ousted Donut Shop and Black Tiger as my favorite K-Cup!<br /><br />I like my coffee rich and dark and Jet Fuel is the best in that category that I have tried so far.  I bought a Keurig Brewer a few years ago in an attempt to stop giving so much of my money to Starbucks. Jet Fuel comes close to the rich full-flavored coffee that you have come to expect from the premium coffee vendors!
Yummy!,This hit my sweet cravings perfectly. Definitely keeping this around. Yum.  I would definitely reccomend this to anyone wanting a quick snack that isn't a lot of calories.  Get the 94% fat free and it's only 100 calories.
Great Product and Fast Shipping!,The Maple Syrup was shipped very quickly.  We are very pleased with this seller and would purchsae from again and again!
Another Great Food!,The stew is a fan favorite in our house! All four large dogs love this stuff and their mama appreciates how healthy the dogs are! Blue fans for life!
UMMMM!!!!!!,"I usually dont like black herbal tea, but this one i was able to sip on the whole cup without making a face. It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past. The Rose flavour is the best. How much it really calms u, god only knows, but the pleasure is unbeatable."
giant gummi bear,Great seller. Item was as described and arrived on time. I gave it as a present and it was pleasantly accepted.
Smooth 3-way coffee,"Great coffee; Hot, Cold or Iced this Dark Roast Kona coffee is akin to aged single barrel Kentucky Whiskey!!  One 8-oz cup of Kona coffee and 1/2 tsp honey is my favorite cup-of-joe. Get whole bean and grind them yourself, and hot water to your French Press and I wait for 6 minutes then enjoy!!"
Formula Changed,The Newman's Own Organics 2nd Generation Turkey & Vegetable has changed the ingredients from Turkey Liver to Pultry Liver.<br />This is not good if your cat is allergic to Chicken as ours is.<br />The Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable original is no longer available.
Addicted to my Nescafe Dulce Gusto,"Love all the Dulce Gustos but not crazy about hot choc. Cappuccino & iced Cap are best! Sipping a hot one while I speak! Love latte, too, but not vanilla latte. Dark Roast is my favorite ""daily."" Thank heavens Amazon offers it and much more affordable prices than anyone else - trust me, I've researched. Best price is on subscription, and so much fun to receive. Great packing and speed - always get before projected date. It's almost affordable! But it's part of my ""champagne taste"" condition! I'll try peach tea - yum - next summer."
"Not a hit with both cats, but blame them not the food!","One of my cats who eats everything loved this food. The other more picky one, not so much.<br />My cats are old though, and weren't raised in this era of healthy cat food, and most of the time wont touch the stuff. So I was happy that at least one of them liked it.<br />I like how all the ingredients are fresh and how there are only a few; not a list 30 things, where half of the words are unpronounceable. The food doesn't smell as bad as most cat food, the kind where as soon as you open it wafts through the house. It also has fresh chunks of chicken and fresh corn and carrots. The gravy in it is very watery and not thick like most cat foods, so it spilled everywhere the first time i opened it. Since then it hasn't, because I haven been more careful.<br />I wish both of my cats liked this food because I know it is so much better for them than what they do like! But I give much kudos to Petit Cuisine on making healthy food for cats."
Great toy but won't last long for strong chewers,"This toy was extremely great . . .My dog learned how to think and figure out ways to get the treats. I have 2 criticisms: 1) if your dog is a strong chewer, that rope won't last long. . . . but that's only if you leave the toy with your dog to play with; if you only use it as a way of dispensing food, then you should take it away after he has finished getting his food/treats out; that should hopefully allow the toy to last longer 2) i wish the bottle itself was made of rubber instead of hard plastic. I have (soft) wood floors so i cringe every time my dog plays with it on the floors . . .it can be loud and my dog's strength when he's playing with it causes me worry that i'm going to find dents in my soft wood floors. Other than that, it's a great toy and I would recommend it."
Great Buy,"These large boxes offere more than we can eat at one sitting, I like the plain version because I can add my own spices.  The texture is perfect, the taste is great, the price is right.  Great change from rice."
"Num, num, num!","Larabar fruit bars are good, especially for we who have many food allergies.  But their Chocolate Coconut Chews are REALLY good!  I think I'm eating a tasty, moist brownie.  Yum!!!<br /><br />Sylvia"
USED To be my favorite graham cracker!,"I wrote the company to tell them about how I did not like the changes they made a couple of years ago to this product.  The texture and quality are different and the packaging has changed, and NOT for the better. This WAS our family's favorite graham cracker. They told me they changed production and there was no going back to the old way.  Too bad, they lost a customer. Also, the last case I received went rancid before the expiration date.  I store these in my pantry, which is cool and dry.  Not sure why that happened, but it was a waste. They also arrive very cracked and broken, due to the way they are packaged. I won't be buying these anymore."
Ken's Steak House Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette is VinaiGREAT! Absolutely delicious.,"First, let me start of by saying that if you don't like other vinaigrette dressings, you're not going to like this one either. It's still made primarily with oil and vinegar. Some people can't stand the way it tastes on a salad, much preferring the creamy dressings. (Which have their place.) But if you like vinaigrettes in general, and raspberry vinaigrette in particular, then this stuff is freakin' spectacular. It has a nice sweet fruity flavor, but almost no sugar. It has that vinegar zip and zing, but not overwhelmingly so. A little bit coats a LOT of lettuce, and it's so delicious that I often find myself surprised by the fact that it has so few calories. This stuff is so good, I'm able to stick to my salad and soup diet, and lost 93 pounds when I first started, which was before I got sick. Since I got sick, I've lost a LOT of weight, but I STILL stick to this dietary plan because the dressing is so good.<br />  Another nice twist, though it has a bit more calories, is Ken's Raspberry Pecan dressing. I've been unable to find it here on Amazon, but my local store carries it. Their other vinaigrette's are just as delicious, though this raspberry walnut remains my favorite. (Another good one is: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00374WLNU"">Ken's Light Balsamic Vinaigrette - 6 Pack</a>) Again, if you like vinaigrette dressing in general, then this is one of the best ones I've ever tasted. Ken's makes a pretty good line of dressing, whether you're in the market for the vinaigrette's, or just looking for some pretty darn good Ranch. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MZ2GZW"">Kens Ranch Dressing (Case of 60)</a> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00436SF7C"">Kens Fat Free Ranch (box of 60)</a>) If you're looking for a vinaigrette that's a cut above the rest, then give this stuff a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Thanks for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"
Absolutely Fantastic,"I bought a box to keep for myself at work. Yesterday, they were gone. I only had one from the entire box. Great for the afternoon hunger and good for you."
zukes,"We have a border collie/husky. She is 13 years old and we love her dearly. She has such a sweet disposition. I keep the Zuke's treats in a basket in the utility room. Whenever I go to that room, Sasha follows me and starts doing some of her tricks on her own hoping she will get one of her treats she loves. Judy Watson"
good quality product,"I use bulghur for tabhoulli and this fine grind soaks up really fast. It's a little TOO fine for my taste, at least on its own, so I mix it with a coarser grind to give it more texture. Good quality product and shipped quickly."
Not very strong,"I've been ordering Jet Fuel for a few years now because it's a good strong coffee. Rainforrest Esspresso is not one. It is very mild and not full body at all. If you like a good cup of Joe, this is not one for you"
The Energy Boost I Need...Without The Jitters!,"I love using 5-Hour Energy to keep up with my kids, my family's hectic schedule - you name it!  This product gives me the boost of energy I need and I don't get left with jitters like I have with other energy products on the market.  This product is great for when you start to feel sluggish in the afternoon and need that extra pick me up to finish out your day.  I still love my morning cup of coffee, but 5-Hour energy is there to help me out later if needed.  I would definitely recommend this product to others!<br /><br />*Disclosure:  I received a sample of this product for review courtesy of Smiley360.com on behalf of 5-Hour Energy."
"Fast, tasty, convenient","This rice is a wonderful microwaveable dish, very convenient.  It smells as good as it tastes, and it doesn't take long to cook."
Da Vinci creamer,I did not like it at all. Tasted to much like maple syrup and it was toooo sweet. I wanted the taste of the pumpkin spice that Starbucks has in there drink. I gave the stuff away.
Yummy!,"Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy."
GREAT WAFFLES,This mix is so easy - just add water. The taste is hearty and VERY GOOD. Makes outstanding waffles. If you have a family of 4 or more this is great size. I open the bag and put mix into an metal cannister to keep it fresh.
Too salty!,Otherwise great. If you're a saltoholic like my husband you'll love these. I got these for the kids' lunchboxes but ended up not using them for that because of the salt.
The only thing that worked,"I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat."
Let them eat cake!!,"Thank you Betty Crocker for making a Gluten Free product that is yummy, easy to make and gluten free! Typically a gluten free cake is more of a science experiment and rarely if ever tastes as good as Betty's does. I highly recommend all of Betty Crocker's  GF mixes to anyone who is gluten intolerant."
My cat loves this stuff,Over the past 2 weeks I've been transitioning my 10 month old cat from dry to wet food. This is the only wet food that he really eats with enthusiasm. I really think it helped in the transition. We've also tried Wellness Core and EVO (also high quality foods) but he likes this stuff the best.
Best chicken marinade ever!!!,"We absolutely love the flavor of Weber's White Wine & Herb marinade.  The flavors are so delicious, we always get many compliments from friends and family.  I simply season my chicken with sea salt, red pepper & black pepper, then pour the marinade on top, and refrigerate overnight to let the flavors soak in.  Kroger's stopped carrying it, so I am delighted to have found it on amazon.com."
Baby mum-mums are AWESOME!!,"My mom gave my son baby mum mums while we were walking around a store one day, and I had never seen them, and he LOVED them!!!  After that, I had such a hard time finding them!!  I was thrilled to find them here.  My son loves them. They are the perfect size for his little hands, and he can chew them fast or they just dissolve in his mouth if he has small chunks left.  He has been eating them for 6 months now, and he still loves them.  He prefers the vegetable, but will eat both flavors.  Will buy them again!!"
Very pleased w/ all Twinings decaf teas,We've been drinking Twinings decaf teas for a while now & this one is new to us. Very pleased with it -- lighter in flavor than Earl Grey -- most enjoyable in the afternoons.
season sardines,"terrible - not tiny as described - had 19 in can. they are cross packed, but should have 30 -32 in can to be the real good ones. KING OSCAR  are the best of all - if you can find them. no more of these for me  (SEASONS)ever."
"ride hard, stay hydrated with cytomax",cyto sport will send you test packets if you call them up. i tested all 4 of their flavors and only liked one! that is pomegranate berry. it tastes great and it works better to quench my thirst and keep my body hydrated for hours with a 1.5 cups into a standard water bottle than any heed product from hammer nutrition
Nectresse A Sweet Option,"Amazon Vine sent me a container of a new product, by the makers of Splenda, called Nectresse. I have been a fan of Splenda since several members of my family were diabetic. Sugar gives me a headache, Splenda didn't. But, I personally found Splenda disappointing to bake with, and the half and half mix really was not a save for me.<br />Meanwhile, I gave up any hope of making several items, until something even better came along. Then came Nectresse, made from Monk Fruit. It is said that the Monks in Vietnam began cultivating the fruit some 800 years ago. It is naturally sweet and low calorie and is now in this wonderful new product. My husband and I tried it this morning in our tea. We don't require tea to be over sweet, but I like to take the biting edge off the brand of green tea that I buy. We both agree that the taste of this is product is full and sweet. I didn't get a headache. I can't wait to make biscotti this year. I will update this review when I am able to share that experience.<br />For now, we find Nectresse an excellent product and look forward to finding many more ways to use it."
Best BBQ Sauce,"I grew up with Open Pit BBQ sauce in IN and could no longer find it in TN. Thanks to the sellers on Amazon, I can continue to enjoy this excellent sauce.  My step sons had never had it before, but it quickly became there favorite. It is the best sauce out there and I would recommend it."
Boring,"This was a just a boring type of coffee, kind of like the kind you can get in a bank that has been sitting out for awhile, nothing exciting about it.  With that stated my two top K cups are Santa's Buzz and Gloria Jean Butter Tofee if that let's you know my taste preferences."
Breakfast on the go! or a Sweet Treat,Gave these breakfast cookies to my Mom for Mother's Day and kept a box for myself.  Much healthier cookie than what she was eating for breakfast.  Great taste and goes good with a cup of coffee.  It's 3 points if you are on weight-watchers.  Mom informed me that she ate them all and Mother's Day was only two weeks ago.  I think she liked them....
Are they kidding with the price?,"Either I'm missing something and this is a double pack, which the description does not seem to support, or these people are insane.  There are loads of places to get this same product for $3.99, $4.99, even as high as $5.99.  What are they thinking?"
Economical higher-quality FLUTD food,"I live with three cats, one of which has to be on a relatively pricey canned prescription diet for a urinary tract condition.  The problem is, this very same cat (Fred) loves to gobble down anything he can find, especially leftovers from the other two.  I've started feeding this to my other two cats that don't have the condition, as a preventative measure, and also to feel safe feeding them all at the same time and not having to worry if Fred picks up their scraps.  I adopted him as an adult, and I think the people that had him as a kitten starved him or fed him a lot of ""people food,"" as I've caught him eating the weirdest stuff -- from pizza to sugar cookies to jalapenos.  This also might explain why his system is a little messed up.<br /><br />Frisky's also has a ""Special Diet"", which is cheaper and therefor probably not as good for kitties.  I ordered that, too, just as a back-up if my other two wouldn't eat Proplan.  I would say they all preferred ProPlan over Frisky's Special Diet (except Fred, who would gleefully scarf down hot garbage if he could get his paws on it).  Cats like what they like, and my cats have slightly more expensive taste -- again, except for Fred, who has quite an indiscriminate attitude towards food.<br /><br />I spoke with the vet about possibly switching Fred from his prescription diet to ProPlan and they reassured me that this was a very good food for cats with urinary tract problems, too.  Fred is the least picky cat I know when it comes to food, so I would only switch if cost because an issue.  I love my cats and they have a great life with me, but there are very occasionally some months where I have to eat off-brand ramen so I can pay the bills....so sometimes my cats have to slum it with me.  They are pretty good sports about it.  :)  I am planning to keep feeding this to my other two cats, with extras on hand for Fred if necessary.<br /><br />The delivery option is GREAT to save on trips to the store, and you can ""subscribe"" and save a buck or so.  If you do the math right (I didn't the first time, whoops), you can ensure the new palate arrives just as your little friends are polishing off the last couple cans.  If you have prime, it even ships for free.  Extremely convenient, cost effective, and perfect for the cat owner who would rather spend time at home with their cats than out running errands for them.  I would highly recommend this product, especially with the subscription if you're kind of lazy and a home-body like me :)<br /><br />Only negative thing I have to say:  I just wish they came in bigger cans.  I do recycle, but I feel that one large can would make less waste than two smaller cans.  On the other hand, my fridge isn't full of half-full cans after the cats eat their breakfast...."
"Flavorful coffee, not for automatic espresso machine though","The beans are extremely oily, so you should not be using it with an automatic espresso machine as it clogs it. The coffee is very rich and flavorful. I used Keurig coffee maker, it took some time for the water to drip through the oily coffee, but it was worth waiting. Recommended for regular coffee makers."
GREAT TEA,I purchase one box of this just to try something different...well when I got it home and tried it...AMAZING flavor...When you drink it I do believe that it does suppress your appetite.  I did not know that was a benefit of this tea but it does work.  Another GREAT Stash Tea.  I also really enjoy the Vanilla Nut Creme Tea and Earl Grey by Stash.
Disappointing,"The nuts arrived super fast.  Kudos for that.  But I found the flavor very disappointing.  I knew they were not salted but I was extremely disappointed in their flavor.  I will toss them out as I just can't stomach them.  I wish I could find the ones I ordered 6 months ago as they were delicious.  Alas, Amazon does not carry them anymore."
Great for Trifle,"I have used Birds Custard Powder for years when making trifle.  I am so happy to find that Amazon carries this, as it's usually not available in local grocery stores.  This is my preferred custard for trifle.  Thanks, Amazon!"
very yummy and excellent protein,"The bar is very tasty and has the protein I was looking for. A great product. I canceled just this month because the price went up by nearly $2. With shipping, a box now costs $14, which is still not bad compared to many other protein/nut bars on the market. Just a little too expensive for me."
Delicious Jerky!,"If you have been disappointed by the jerky sold in the stores, order this stuff instead. The Sweet Chipolte jerky is very flavorful, yet the meat was soft and tender, and easy to pull apart. While a little more expensive, you can taste the difference. Trust me, you will Krave more of this jerky."
Maple Syrup,Good price for the size I wanted and great quality.  It was just what I needed for a mead project.  Items was delivered quickly.
Definitely their worst bar. Tastes like coffee grounds!,"We love Gnu Bars, and have tried almost all the flavors now (but one).<br />But this one needs to go back to the kitchen for a rework!!<br /><br />One word description: YUCK!<br /><br />We all love coffee flavored items, so really, I thought this one might be a favorite.<br />However, it doesn't taste like coffee liquid. It tastes like someone poured the old coffee<br />grounds from a pot into the bars!<br />Seriously, it was that bad.<br /><br />Three people who like coffee gave it double thumbs-down.<br />Seriously iffy texture, and the taste of licking a paper cone<br />full of coffee grounds. NOT good!<br /><br />FYI since it isn't in the listing - Espresso Chip Bar<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Gnu High Fiber Blend (whole rolled oats, organic whole wheat flour, wheat bran, organic kamut, psyllium, flax, millet)<br />chicory root inulin, fruit juices, rice dextrins, canola oil, cocoa powder, plums, rice, ground coffee beans,<br />chocolate chips (sugar, chocolate flavor, cocoa butter, dextrose, lecithin), natural flavors, wheat protein isolate, baking power.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />Serving size - 1 bar<br />Calories - 140<br />Total fat - 4g<br />Cholestrol - 0 mg<br />Sodium - 35 mg<br />Total Carb - 30g<br />Protein - 4g"
INFO ABOUT RECALL- and my personal review at the end,"March 1, 2011<br /><br />Vet Med received notification today from WellPet® LLC., the parent company for WELLNESS® Pet Foods, that specific lots of WELLNESS® canned cat foods, purchased from our store, should be returned to us immediately for replacement.<br /><br />The company has reassured us that there is no immediate threat to the health of our customer's beloved pets, however, recent testing has indicated that specific lots might contain less than adequate levels of thiamine (also known as Vitamin B1).<br /><br />Cats fed only these products over time could be at risk for developing thiamine deficiency. Although the risk for thiamine deficiency is remote, the company is taking the extra precaution of voluntarily removing these products from store shelves and asking customers to return any of the affected lots. The company has also taken additional steps in their manufacturing process to ensure that this does not happen again.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I have been feeding Wellness for years. My ten year old is in optimal health. She's never had a surgery other than her spay, and has only been on antibiotics a couple times. She's been fed Wellness since I received her."
Perfect!!!!,Thank you!! We live in the middle of nowhere and can't by this product local!!! so again thanks!!<br />I love Amazon!!
Decent energy. Awful taste.,"This was one of the most disgusting things I've ever tasted.  I could only manage to stomach half of the can before I had to pour the other half down the sink. On the plus side, if I had managed to finish the can, I might have gotten a decent energy boost out of it, since the half I was able to drink was enough to at least keep me awake for the last few hours of my shift."
Smells good...,"I had high hopes for this, despite knowing from reviews here that it contained a sugar substitute. I love hot cider, and especially caramel cider. It smelled great brewing but when I went to take a sip -- ick! The artificial sugar makes this intolerable for me. People who routinely use stuff like Sweet n Low will probably love this. Me, I'm just glad I got this in a sampler rather than buying a huge box as I was tempted to do. Grove Square needs to offer an option that uses real sugar because I think they got it right otherwise. Disappointed. Wanted to really like this."
Great Breakfast option.,I have used Carnation Instant Breakfast Sugarfree  before and love it for a quick satisfying breakfast.  It is very difficult to find anything other than the SF chocolate in a canister so it's was nice to order a quanity of the variety pack from Amazon.
Love my Pet,"I did alot of research on this product and all products I give my pets, first and formost is it good for my pet and does my pet like the product,which they really do,I like the fact it is all natural and healthy, and the manufacturing of this product seems to be state of the art."
pasta purchase,"this pasta is no longer available in our local grocery stores so was thrilled to find it here....ordered a ""bunch"" and shared it with several family members - so glad I found it !!"
Very nice cup of coffee,"I ordered this for the ""mocha"" flavor but really cannot say that I found it.  I will say however that this does make a very nice smooth cup of coffee, so much so that although I ordered this for ""after dinner"" coffee, I have been making it for breakfast."
Really tiny bears!,"I was surprised when I opened these up to see how ""mini"" the bears and the packages are.  For some reason I thought mini applied to the size of the packs!  That being said they are delicious as all haribo products are.  The tiny bears and tiny packs make them a good size for small rewards or for cupcake decorating."
Hansen Energy Drink,"I really like Hansen Energy Pro! It has B vitamins, Ta-urine, Ginseng, and Ginkgo- All nutrients that help support<br />a busy lifestyle. It gives me a boost without the jittery crash later and it tastes great! I order it online because I cannot find it anywhere in my area."
Excellent Dog Treat,"My ultra finicky American Eskimo dog, Precious, loves these treats. I buy this brand because they are manufactured in the US not China. Originally I bought the duck jerky PetsMart carried, which was from China and it made Precious extremely ill. Now I only buy treats made in the US or Canada. These particular treats are best for smaller size dogs, big dogs would probably gulp them down instead of chewing them up."
Very flavorful!,"After ignoring these in the supermarket for some time, I was introduced to them at my new job where everyone kept scarfing them down. Being a garlic lover, I just had to try one. I'm hooked. They are light, airy, and so full of flavor. They do get your hands a bit greasy reminding you that they aren't a fat free light food. I'm not into potato chips, so I searched my supermarket for the garlic flavor to no avail. How delightful I can order them from Amazon!<br /><br />I gave the review 4 stars because sometimes the bag is full of broken pieces instead of full bagel chips. As another reviewer said, a resealable bag would add to the product. However, maybe the creators know how quickly they will be devoured... :)"
Family Pleaser,"This is a terrific seasoning for all kinds of meat. I may even try it on fish. I have used it with beef burritos, chicken enchiladas, tacos, etc. Everytime I use it, my family and friends love it and ask for ""my"" recipe."
"Big name, mediocre product","Another reviewer summed it up nicely:  ""The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike.""  Additionally, the company itself is not customer friendly.  Don't expect much help if there's a problem with the order or delivery."
Going down the bin!,"One of the worst pani puris ever. When you mix the ingredients, everything is so spicy that you would probably need a gallon of water just after a bite or two (and this is coming from a person who adds tons of spices to just about anything, but this thing was just insane like eating a lot of wasabis together). The water made from the paste is just ridiculous. I am just going to throw everything away...buy and see for yourself...you'll be disappointed if you've ever tasted the real thing before."
This is serious,"Folks,now that I have your attention:  Buy these crackers and replace all the typical crap you have lying around your house. These are known as a ""heart healthy"" and are recommended by my cardiology group. (Note: I am not a cardiologist but I slept at a Holiday Inn last nite!) These are low sugar,low fat, no trans fat,etc. As important, if you consume these instead of potato chips,cheese doodles,onion dip and salsa chips you will be replacing the bad cholesterol stuff with the good stuff and keeping your sugar intake low as well. A lot of eating is emotional and psychological based,not hunger based. Do the above mentioned swap,give it six weeks and you will be proactively ahead of the curve. I put these in my music store as well,on the front counter. customers eat about half and my employees gobble the rest of them up.""Wanna buy a banjo,here..have a handful of these while you think about it!"""
BEST MUSTARD EVER!,"This mustard was on the table at Milton's (a deli style restaurant iin Del Mar, CA. I loved it and bought a bottle to take home. I was happy to find that I wouldn't have to drive back to Del Mar to get some more.<br />The price is great on Amazon and the product is wonderful."
A matter of taste,"After seeing the reviews on these fruit thins, I was afraid they would be a big disappointment.  However, I was delighted to find they were delicious.  I think it's a matter of taste, and expectation.  I was not expecting these to even be comparable to Fig Newtons.  I expected, and wanted, a cookie - not ""fruit and cake.""  And this is definitely more of a cookie, with a crunch.  I agree with another reviewer that they smell wonderful.  They are a good size (about the same size as Chips Ahoy cookies, only thinner), and you get three cookies to a serving for 140 calories. I found them to be similar to a tea cookie.  In fact, I enjoyed them with a cup of hot tea as a nice treat.<br /><br />Yes, the fig is a subtle flavor (despite the bits of it in the cookie).  Yet, I didn't find this to be a detriment; they are a lightly sweet cookie, which make for a reasonably low calorie snack.  If I wanted a strong fig flavor, I'd just buy Fig Newtons!  Overall, I loved them and would buy them again."
not much better than I the salmon flavored one.,"Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him."
Good product,"These work well in recipes where you want to ""sneak"" in some chia so no one the the family can see it!  Another plus, they are not manufactured with peanut.<br />I use them to sprinkle on oatmeal, cereal, salads, spaghetti, even on pizza.  Easy way to get some healthy fats added without a ton of calories.<br />They also work well in cookies, just be sure and not cook over 350."
Aptly named -- this stuff is greatness...,"I'm a big fan of jerk chicken/pork/shrimp. I have enjoyed the products made by others but found they didn't suit my preferences exactly -- until stumbling across this product during my quest for a fine jerk marinade. Since then I've been a regular user of The Shizzle as I have found that it is amazingly versatile, easy to use and quite tasty.  Perhaps most importantly I have also discovered that everyone in the family enjoys it.  The regular Shizzle is has the perfect amount of zing to please even those who like a bit of spice but won't chase away those who don't.  That is the beauty of this stuff.  I've some harsh critics in the family so the first time I broke this stuff out I didn't mention it until they tried it.  The all asked what it was and then asked for more -- I knew I'd found my stuff.<br /><br />I also own some of the Voodoo Hot Shizzle which is not outrageous but just right for those of us who enjoy some kick.  I skewer my fresh shrimp and then let it bathe in this stuff overnight prior to firing up the grill and it is OUTSTANDING.<br /><br />I guess the real beauty of this product is the knowledge that there is no crap in there.  It's made from all natural stuff and all of it is good.  Bottom line -- this is the jerk marinade I would make if I were talented enough to make a good jerk marinade."
yummy,These are so tasty.  A little high in fat but they are a long-lasting snack.  I haven't seen this flavor in stores.
This tea is the lowest quality,"Not only it's the low quality but also it's old, must produced and leaving in the air years before it arrive on my hand. Here is the thing: The green tea, no matter how the grade they are, the frashness is the most important. Low end green tea if they produced within one year they still have good vitamin even their taster is not so good. If they exposed in air more than one year, the vitamin get oxidazed, even the good grade tea become worthless. Unfortunately these tea didn't wrapping in the air tight package, loose like made in last century."
Great product once again from Jolly Time.,I love Jolly Time white popcorn.  This particular product almost extinct from Utah.  I knew Amazon had it and knew their price was awesome; so I ordered it and then discovered I liked their other product as well or even better for my diet.  Thanks Jolly Time!!!
Delicious!,"A taste sensation, whether you make it by the package directions or spruce it up as other reviewers have done.  One of the best pre-packaged gluten free products on the market."
Tea?,"This stuff is awful, cheap leaves and just not good. I've made better tea drying blackberry leaves! Stick to Liptons or Red Rose!!"
Not good,"I bought the 16oz package after my previous supplier was back ordered. The ginger was dark, springy and had an off flavor. Maybe I am just spoiled, but I threw out the whole lot, after I received my 5lbs from previous supplier."
Wonderful creamy grits,"These are very creamy, great tasting grits.  Taste even better than locally ground corn grits.  The only drawback is the fact that it is such a small package."
Best dog food EVER!,"Looked everywhere and couldnt find the food In my home town, finally decided to look on line luckly.found it on amazon.com, my picky dog Corona, loves this foods, n shes more active,coats is shinner, n beter for here digestive system. After going though many bags n brands, finally found the keeper, only dowbad thing was when I arrived home the box rapping n the bad was ripped n ants were starting to get in, overall 4stars Coron(blue-healer) approvrd."
Great meal replacement shake,"I love the taste of this shake, it is better than chocolate milk, and when I am hungry it talks away the feeling for a few hours.  I have this shake setup now with Amazon auto-ship now, as the store called: mother's doesn't seem to keep in regular supply"
Perfect,"I received my case of Zico Coconut Water within the two days advertised by ""Amazon Prime"".  It was interesting to me that, what with the free shipping, this was more than a dollar a bottle cheaper than I buy it for in the grocery store.  It came double boxed.  That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any ""hidden"" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories."
Terrible tasting tea; also contains citric acid,"Unfortunately, I found this tea to have a simply awful taste.<br />I did not mind the box haphazardly-crammed full of 100 tea envelopes, but the tea itself has a nasty bitter taste--I have used lots of different kinds of ginger teas, so I believe I know how ginger tea should taste.<br />I was surprised to find that one of the ingredients is citric acid, though I don't understand why they would include that ingredient in an herbal tea."
All broken up,"I have ordered chips from Amazon before and they have come no more broken up than what you would buy at the grocery store -- specifically, the Bearitos blue corn chips.  They came double boxed with outer box being particularly strong.<br /><br />This time, these Mexi-Snax Sesame chips were sent in the original manufacturer's box and were really smashed.  I called Amazon, and said it must be the single box vs. double box that got them all smashed.  Amazon graciously and quickly sent me a new case of the chips, double boxed as requested.  They were smashed up even more!  I finally figured it out:  these chips were packaged like they were ""vacuum-sealed""... there was absolutely almost no air in the bags, and that's why they crushed easily.  (The Bearitos chips had plenty of air in the bag, allowing for shifting during shipping, which is why they arrived in almost perfect condition.)<br /><br />I called Amazon again, thanked them for sending the chips double boxed, but told them they were more crushed than ever, and I felt it was a manufacturer's packaging problem and the apparent ""vacuum-sealing"" of the product.  They quickly refunded my money.<br /><br />So while I was not pleased with the Mexi-Snax chips, I was extremely satisfied with Amazon's customer service representatives and their handling of the situation."
they sort of work,they arrived on time but dont quite melt as advertised required much stiring and left something of a sludge at the bottom of the cup
Wolfgang Puck coffee for Keurig maker,The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I don't think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase.
Doesn't fit! False advertising on packaging.,"These pods do not fit in the Senseo machines. The lid will not shut with just a single pod in the holder. My husband did manage to shut the lid but then the coffee leaked out the sides of the machine because the seal couldn't properly close around the pod. Packaging says ""Fits all coffee pod brewers!"" and it is a total lie."
Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound,"I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only ""dog foods"" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend."
No quality issues but taste is sub-par.,I haven't been having quality issues like some of the others.  However I really don't care for the Fuhgeddaboutit flavor.  It tastes like cheap instant coffee.  Very ashy and bland.<br /><br />6/15/12 Update:<br />Thank you Brooklyn Bean for the excellent response and the variety box.  After tasting all the flavors I've determined that I just don't like the dark roasts from Brooklyn Bean.  I like the medium and light roasts.<br /><br />However I am getting a lot of grounds in my cup from quite a few of these.  Our commercial machines at work really don't like these for some reason.
Perfect for Wilton Candy Melts,"These flavors work perfectly with Wilton Candy Melts! I used them to flavor a wide variety of chocolate and candy melt creations. The flavors taste natural, and are strong enough to require very little per batch."
Fruity Good!!!,"I just received my shipment of this tea and all I can say is WOW! The tea comes in a nice large 1 lb bag, so you really get your moneys worth. When you open the bag the smell hits you right away. It has a very fruity and light flowery smell to it. I brewed my tea and the tea gave a nice deep red color and the smell was just nice. I have tried alot of teas and have to say this is the best tea I ever had. If you like berry or fruit flavored teas, I would highly recommend this. The only disappointment I had was that I didn't realize it was caffeine free. I like my caffeine so when I need it I just mix this with another one I have with caffeine. I also like my teas over ice and this is just great. Thank God I used the subsribe and save. I think I am going to have to make them ship my next shipment sooner than 6 months, that's how good this one is."
"Great, Strong Coffee","Personally, I received this product by going down the list of K-Cups trying to find that perfect cup to put on scheduled delivery.  This is a nice bold coffee, and oddly fiscal.  I personally like the first brew, and the house mate likes the second and third, now THAT is a good deal."
Bitter with no vanilla taste,"Smells great... too bad it didn't taste good too. I tasted no vanilla, and the coffee itself was very bitter for a medium roast. I wouldn't buy this product myself as I like to have FLAVOR in my flavored coffee and I don't think this had any. Overall, it was a disappointment."
My favorite coffee,This is a great product.  I love the Keurig and Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is just right for me.
this soup will spoil you,"If all you've got to compare this to is Campbell's version, you are in for a treat deluxe. Or perhaps you will be a little freaked out by the difference. One of the two. :-)<br /><br />This is not a gloppy, mushroom-free zone kind of soup. Nope, it's thick and flecked with mushroom bits along with chunks that don't have the consistency of rubber. You can taste the butter in this one; it's not strictly a low-cal food.<br /><br />It makes a great soup all on its own, and I'm totally in favor of a bowl of this with some Ryvita Pumpkin seeds and Oats crackers <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDBRI6"">Ryvita Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Pumpkin Seeds & Oats, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a> on the side.<br /><br />I also like this soup as a sauce for a variety of vegetables and even for meats like pork chops and chicken breasts. Normally, I find chicken breasts too dry and dense, but when simmered in this soup for about 20 minutes, they come out moist and flavorful. Yummy! Same goes for pork chops that you've first lightly browned then smothered with this soup and simmered over low heat for 30 minutes or so. Majorly yummy.<br /><br />One last thing I do with this soup is use it with pasta, like whole wheat elbow macaroni or rotini. Like other reviewers, I ""pump up"" the soup with fresh mushies and perhaps even some diced onion and green peppers.<br /><br />Whether you consume this as a soup or use it as sauce for other veggies/meats/grains/pastas, you'll be pretty pleased.<br /><br />And hey--it's organic, non-GMO, etc. What's to not like?"
"Cats love this, will eat nothing else. Amazon cost is too high though","I buy this at local grocer but it has been out of stock lately. Since my one outdoor cat is fussy he will eat nothing but this food. Not even the other flavors, has to be the grillers blend. SO, I had to find it online and while Amazon was the least costly of the options its still too high. I pay roughly $12 for the large bag at the grocer. The 9 pounds in this 3 pack were a couple dollars more. Even with prime shipping its too much. Buy at Walmart or grocer."
Love these smokies!,"Could only find at local Shell gas station......now I have a source to buy all I want!  Fast & secure delivery....price is great!  Will order again, and again, etc.,....."
A difference I can see.,"I recently switched to this food for my three dogs, an eight year old chocolate Lab, a ten year old miniature Dachshund and a one year old miniature Chihuahua. They all like it. The lab has actually left food in her bowl, but just because she is satisfied with less. She goes to her feeding eagerly but doesn't finish it all. The doxie has always been greedy, but now leaves the leftovers alone if I keep an eye on her. The littlest has been a free feeder from the start and may actually be eating a little more than before. The most important difference I see is their energy levels, the older ones are acting like puppies again. Their coats are shiny and thick, even the Chihuahua has thick fur now! I had hoped they would do well on a grain free diet, and this is even better than I expected. I have put this food on a subscribe and save basis so I will never run out!"
"No actual bears, just a fake cardboard pair","Ordered this thinking it came with two stuffed bears.  For the price it should have, but it was instead a cardboard photo copy of the bears.  What a joke.  Sending this back."
Good product.  Best price for the product.,Organic baby food is not cheap.  My daughter loves baby prunes.  She also loves bananas...so I love having the baby prunes around to counteract the bananas.  Amazon Subscribe & Save is definitely the cheapest and most convenient way to stock up on these healthy baby foods.
not the best but a good value,"I go through about a pound and a half of phoenix pearls a year.  I've purchased through local stores and over the net.  This is the only tea I've ever bought called ""dragon phoenix pearls"" that didn't have a jasmine flower in the center of the pearl.  I may be wrong but I thought the whole jasmine flower was necessary to be called a ""dragon phoenix pearl"".  Usually I get five or more infusions from each fresh load of tea.  This tea is washed out after three infusions.  That being said at the price this is a good jasmine tea.  The first couple of infusions are very flavorful.  And it was about the freshest tea I've ever purchased. It's up to you this may or may not technically be true ""dragon phoenix pearls"", but it is a very good jasmine tea for the price."
Nope,"Ordered malossol salmon caviar, received some orange mess in a regular green tin. Brave soul that I am - I have actually tried this nonsense. It does not come even close to resembling what a fresh, properly handled caviar should taste like. If I am still alive in 2 hours I guess you can call it ""edible""."
Must be mislabeled,"This is the hottest enchilada sauce I have ever tasted. Even although the can is marked ""Mild"" it is approximately one step away from bringing tears to your eyes. We actually had to throw the meal We prepared away because no one could eat it. If the can had been marked ""Medium"" ( which would still be a strech) or ""Hot"" We would not have purchased it."
As healthy as bars get,"The raw nuts and fruits in these bars make them as close to nature as anything you will find in a wrapper. The Larabar reminds me of the naturally zesty and sweet fruit rolls I used to eat as a kid but also has wonderful, flavorfull fresh nuts mixed in. Raw nuts contain healthy fats and the protein and fat in the nuts will lower the glycemic index of the food. If you don't want to lug around raw cherries and a snack bag of raw nuts, this is the convenient alternative.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are excellent treats for pets too. They are especially nice for birds who like to pick at the dried fruit and munch on the raw nuts. If you are going to offer these to a pet, please check the ingredients to be sure they are compatible with your species of pet."
Yummy snack,"My 8 pound Havanese loves these. I literally just got her yesterday but she eats these happily. I read the reviews about how delicious these smelled, and they do seem tempting. The flavors and ingredients are great. I am doing a mostly grain free diet with her so these are perfect. And the size is great for training. I break one up with no problem."
Only for some people who don't have H-Mart around.,"This is way expensive.<br />there are only 10 pc in a box.<br />I prefer Saeng Saeng Woodon.<br /><br />Actually, H-mart will soon import this ramen so plz be patient little more."
ROTTEN SERVICE...... ISH!,"Well, just be sure that you dont mind ordering bulk and getting an entirely different product than you ordered!!! ~Amazon.com sellers' return policy doesn't allow returns. I ordered Palak Paneer cans in count 12 but recieved 12 count of Mughal Shahi Rajma.  A dish I have absolutely no interest in and never would have ordered."
My Favorite Coconut Oil,"This truly is a wonderful, multi-purpose product! The scent is light and aromatic in the jar and smells great when you're cooking with it. I enjoy cooking with it but also use it on my skin and hair. No other product will leave your skin feeling so silky soft and nourished."
NOT Natural - Contains Nitrites,"While I read here the original flavor was natural, there was no list of ingredients available. And to my disappointment when this arrived it does indeed contain nitrites. The taste is alright, but I really would like to find jerky WITHOUT Nitrites or Nitrates. I've kept it in the fridge now for several months (i haven't had any mold issues) since I truly try to consume nitrites as little as possible, it will take a very long time to eat this or I'll end up trashing it. Please REVISE the description to be accurate! This brand DOES from my understanding have a truly natural version, that I cannot seem to find on Amazon."
YUMMY!,"These chocolate bars are the best.  Forget the Kit Kat that everybody compares them too.  They are superior.  They are not that easy to find, so get them here!"
Good Jerky,"I like the peppered flavor a lot better than the original or plain, it does have a good cracked pepper flavor. I also think the quality is better than most other brands that I have tried. I like the 1 oz. packages and great value compared to buying individually."
STALE.  Beware buying these on special!,"I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same."
Wonderful Earl Grey Tea,"I have been caffeine free for a year now and I do appreciate products that are truly caffiene-free (rather than low-caffeine). This tea is as caffeine free as they come, and it has a wonderful flavor -- unlike any other Earl Grey I have tried. This is truly a winner and I will be back for more when my current stash runs out."
Not as good as I remember`,I've bought these cookies before and they were just wonderful.  But these were not as good as I remember and the packing makes it difficult to retrieve a cookie without breaking it.
Strong,"This coffee is not bad.  It has a very strong, smokey flavor, but is a bit on the bitter side, which is why I did not give it a 5-Star rating.  I am still searching for a strong, smooth K-Cup that I can use in a profession office machine that is sold in Subscribe & Save."
Great Salt,"I haven't purchased the 5# bag yet, but I will now that I have found it! I love this salt, it really adds so much flavor to what I am cooking. Am a complete convert! My 2 year old son even asks for it!"
Cat Loved it.. BUT....Their hair started to fall out.,Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad.<br />Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine.<br />Back to feeding my cats Nature's Variety instinct.<br />I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon.<br />Will not use it again.
"The ""Replicator"" of our time.","We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic ""replicators"", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts.<br /><br />We love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher-end unit to our own home environment.<br /><br />We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience.<br /><br />I especially like the Hot-Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options.<br /><br />Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station."
Sugar Sugar Sugar,"While I was in a coma I ate these for desert.  They are very good tasting, don't have any ""Sugary muck"" taste, just plain, but really filling and don't give me gas.<br /><br />I like them with iced tea or pelican juice.<br /><br />Since there's no Sugar in them you can leave them out in the sun without getting a diabetic seizure.  Ants don't like them for some reason."
Very Effective,"I purchase this locally from a brick & mortar store and it works very well. It typically takes about 12-24 hours for the effects to kick in, but once they do cramping & bleeding is significantly reduced. It's not a magic cure, but it makes things bearable enough that you can function and get through the day without becoming homicidal or having to lie in bed curled up into a ball of misery."
Pamela's Ultimate  Baking and Pacake Mix,"This is one of our favorite gf products! We love making waffles,pancakes and cookies with this! No one can tell it is gluten free.<br />It uses almond flour and I think that is what keeps everything so moist. Alot of gluten free products are dry and do not hold together well. Not Pamela's! It has made my life simpler and is one of the besst products out there. I would not recommend it for bread unless it was a quick bread as it just doesn't have the texture and taste of bread. It is a little sweet. Pamela's is wonderful to meet 95% of your baking needs!"
Nice,"This conditioner made my hair silkier and softer as well as making my hair and scalp feel healthier. There have been no ill-effects and it keeps my hair nice just as well as my usual brand, Tresemme, does."
Great multi-use product,"I have purchased this exact product elsewhere & have yet to find this great of a deal! Nutiva tastes & smells amazing!! I truly appreciate the option to ""auto ship"" too. I use this oil from cooking, to hair care, to skin care...love it!"
"Good, not great","After the Protein Water in the bottle could not be found any where, I found the Mix in Amazon and tried, the taste is not the same, you can adjust it not to be too strong, or lighter but it still gave you an mild after taste.The good thing about it is it costs so much less, so I stay with it, after a while, you get used to and it still good after all."
Dogs Joy,My small dog loves these. He waits at the closet door every day begging for one. I try to keep them on hand for him. They also are nice when I go away. It keeps him busy till I get home.
Delightful pop!,"This salmon roe caviar is both affordable and delicious.  Each little pop of salty roe atop a blini or water cracker is devine.  Also good paired with raw quail egg, ponzu, sake, scallion, sea urchin roe and tobiko for an ""uni shooter""...Yummmmm..."
My dogs can't wait to eat,"My two black labs love this, I mix the Eagle Pack in with their dry food and they eat like they are starving.  I was looking for canned dog food that I could order online and have delivered quickly.  Shipping was fast and I tried the Eagle Pack beef right away (before I had used up my other brand cans).  I found out about it on one of the dog food reviews that listed five star and down dog foods.  My dogs had been leaving food in their bowls and it wasn't like them so I started looking at reviews and ingredients and pricing.  This was one of the best for everything.  Doesn't matter what I think, my dogs love it and they look healthier! Another plus was that two of the flavors were Amazon Prime eligible.  Fast and convenient."
"Chewy, but not gooey","These were pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. The texture was good, as far as soft cookies go. They were soft, but still held together in the package and when you removed them from the package. The flavor was stronger and more chocolatey than the ""megafudge""  version of this cookie, which I also sampled. They were not gooey, in spite of the name of the cookie, but I see that as a benefit.<br /><br />The cookies come in the resealable package, which works very well and I like.<br /><br />I probably would not buy these cookies in the store, but did like them well enough to eat several for dessert on the day I opened up the package."
YUM!,This is the best everyone! I can eat the whole box. And its all natural! Better than Kraft!
Made in China - won't buy anymore,"My dog became very ill (vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating pain) in mid-Oct and spent three days at the Emergency Vet - and cost us $3500! They ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have Irritable Bowel Disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional $1800. He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate. I can't say for sure that these were the cause but I won't be buying ANY dog food products (treats or otherwise) that are made in China. Treats made in the USA only for us!!"
love this,"I usually don't like sweetened teas but this is really good. I will try the other flavors as well, we keep a gallon in the fridge at all times."
Great Fun!!!  Ex-cel-lent!!!,"Great Taste.  Use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SU35"">Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> and gourmet oil and butter.  Ex-cel-lent."
Delicious and worth the price,"Someone recommended using dutch cocoa for my Christmas baking this year.  I am so glad they did!  It really does make a difference.  I've used it in a cake, brownies, and chocolate frosting.  The taste is smooth and delicious.<br /><br />I'm not a professional, but I loved the flavor.  I highly recommend using this product....give it a try!"
FedEx Smartpost is the StupidPost!,"I have no qualms whatsoever with the product. Haribo gummy frogs are my favorite candies and will always manage to put me in my happy place. My problem is with the means by it was delivered. If I had known it was being delivered through FedEx, I would have gone and bought the product through some other means.<br /><br />Here's my beef with FedEx. They are totally and completely unreliable and incompetent. Through the USPS, It take 4-5 days to deliver mail from New Jersey to New York City. FedEx so far is taking 7 days. What the fudge?!<br /><br />If you're willing to pay extra bucks to have it delivered quickly then you're not going to have a problem. However, if you don't plan to spend that much money on a bag of candy, I suggest you have it sent to a P.O. box or buy it somewhere else.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/10/12<br /><br />Still no sign of my package. An order from the UK showed up in one week. I strongly recommend paying the extra dollars for expedited delivery and/or ordering it through a website that does not use FedEx Smart Post."
"texture too ""sugary""","I like my ginger with a nice strong flavor, which these consistently have.  But...the quality is just too sugary for me.  It is like eating a sugar cube. I have had others bought online that are much less crumbly in the mouth and don't have a sugary, gritty feel.  Try others before this one.  my opinion only; everyone has a preference."
Great for busy families,"I have 3 children under the age of 8 and work fulltime, so we are always on the go.  The Happymorning product line has helped us immensely, not just in the mornings, but for afternoon snacks as well.  It is an easy way for my kids to grab a healthy snack while completing homework before we rush out the door to afternoon practices.  It is also an easy snack to toss in their lunchboxes and I do not have to worry about what they are eating while at school because they are not going to trade away their favorite snack! The Super Banana in particular is my childrens' favorite - they often fight over the last one!"
Hard,"Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard."
fantastic treat,"better than expected and delicious. well priced, soothing stomach warming remedy; cheaper than whole foods market and so nice to be deliverd"
Awesome Instant coffee!,I am a major coffee drinker. I love this coffee. It is my favorite instant coffee. You can't even tell it's instant. I recommend this to anyone who likes coffee and would enjoy the conveinence of having it ready in an instant!
So Tasty!,"My only problem with this lip balm is that it tastes so good I lick it off! If you like coconut anything you'll love this!<br /><br />I love that it's made with 100% vegetarian ingredients and is never tested on animals. The ingredients are also 82% certified organic, which is a nice plus."
Spectacular Brewing Failures but much less frequent (caffeinated only),"Something about the Brooklyn Bridge compelled me to try this product and - admittedly - I jump all over the K Cup spectrum trying each variety. I should also note that I'm hardly a coffee expert; even gas station coffee that has been sitting for two hours tastes fine to me. The ONLY reason I'd ever write a coffee review is if something about the packaging made life difficult and this is certainly the case here.<br /><br />On our first brew in the Keurig, coffee grinds were thrown out of the top of the machine and all over the counter. When we removed the pod, the foil had actually been shifted off of the base, creating about a half of an inch slit for grinds to be pushed out by the force of the water during the brewing cycle. To be fair, we tried three more pods and each exploded in their own, creative ways. On one , the hole created in the top was massive and allowed grinds to explode out of the container (I assume weak foil allowed the hole to grow during brewing. On another, for whatever reason, only an eighth of a cup of coffee was allowed out of the pod.<br /><br />OK - maybe our brewer needed cleaning or was in a state of disrepair? We put a pod of known good Timothy's in and the machine performed flawlessly.<br /><br />I'm assuming that in this first run of product, this coffee either missed on the specification for packing for the Keurig, used some bad materials, or perhaps both. But I'd steer clear for a while. I just tried to send these back but Amazon doesn't take returns on Grocery products. I'll be calling shortly to see what can be done. As is, these are useless and a pure waste of money.<br /><br />===Updated April 19, 2012===<br /><br />As you can see, Ruth from Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee used this thread to offer to replace my bad lots of coffee of which I had two, the Brooklyn Bridge Blend and the Decaf blend. I took her up on the offer, wrote her, gave my address, and indicated that I would change my review if warranted based on the results. Although I got no response to my email, two boxes of coffee showed up about a week later. So we put them to the test.<br /><br />The first box that I opened was the Brooklyn Bridge Blend. I tried four of the pods, and each worked without issue. The coffee was tasty enough but the real measuring stick for me was 'are there coffee grounds on my counter' and the answer in this case was no.<br /><br />Alas, we tried the Decaf. The first two pods immediately blew up during brewing. In one case, grounds came out of the coffee machine and in the other, grounds filled the coffee cup. In this case, the coffee failed my rather simple test criteria.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is this company knew they were replacing bad batches of pods, had all the advanced warning that they needed to select a batch of known good quality, and we encountered the same issues as on our first purchase.<br /><br />I'm very appreciative of this company's efforts to make this right but my sense is that they have immature quality control processes and I cannot recommend this brand based on the higher than acceptable probability that you will end up with a bad batch.<br /><br />===Edit May 3, 2012===<br /><br />Ruth at Brooklyn Bean sent me a sample pack which contained seven different caffeinated flavors for me to try. I very much appreciate the efforts of this company to show their quality control processes have been fixed. I am not quite done with the entire sample pack but I wanted to post my progress for those interested.<br /><br />First, though, to Lisa Lou and others who may be thinking it, I am confident that I have ruled out machine error as a factor in my previous reviews. First, the machine was fully cleaned and de-scaled before testing and I have numerous ""known good"" pods from other suppliers that function flawlessly.<br /><br />That being said, I can say that these samples have performed very well. I have tested the following:<br /><br />4 Donut Shop<br />2 Cyclone<br />4 Boardwalk Blend<br />4 French Roast<br />1 Breakfast Blend<br />1 Columbian<br />1 Fuhgeddaboutit<br /><br />Of these 17, only one time (with a Boardwalk Blend) did the pod explode in the manner described in my review. It did explode fabulously - with grinds coming onto the counter and filling the internal unit (very hard to clean) - requiring a full cleaning of the machine. This happened only once, however, and this rate of failure isn't out of line with what I've experienced with other brands (they just fail in different ways - like grinds in the cup or a half full cup of coffee).<br /><br />I can say with reasonable confidence that the production issues are probably solved for the *caffeinated* flavors. I have no way of determining if the issues associated with the decaf have been solved.<br /><br />I am switching my rating to 3 Star given the spectacular (but more rare) nature of failures with this brand and given the uncertainty of the performance of the decaf variety.<br /><br />I hope this helps."
no MSG? ahem,It contains autolyzed yeast extract  which is equivalent to MSG.  I checked the nutrition info on their website and it wasn't included in the list of ingredients so I grabbed a box I had in the kitchen and it was listed there.
Great Canned Cookies!,"These cookies are fantastically tasty,& arrived with only a little breakage (other reviewers complained of this, but given how ridiculously fragile these cookies are, it's not surprising).Perhaps the packaging folks at amazon were more careful-either way they arrived in good shape, the cookies themselves are quite tasty & remind me of lemon ""Trix"" only WAY better (I consider it a good sign when a food item brings back seemingly random childhood memories) they are so tasty in fact, that I'm eager to try their other cookies as well...the cans are useful when empty too...."
I'll use this for the health benefits,"I was surprised that this was not a great tasting product. It was not good at all, but in small amounts I'll add it to smoothies since I am very keen on my health."
Great product,"This is a great way to get dogs to take their pills willingly. My dog is very picky, but he thinks these are treats regardless of the pills inside. If you are giving a lot of pills every day you really have to shop around to get the best prices, and order in bulk. I buy both Small and Large pill pockets - 1 in Chicken flavor and one in Beef, just for variety. The Large pill pockets may be a better buy actually because each large pocket can be used to cover 2 or more pills depending on the pill size. The pill pockets are soft so you can mold this stuff like dough around any shape or size pill or capsule - once your sure your dog really likes them & doesn't hesitate to swallow them immediately. This is much easier and less messy than using peanut butter or hot dogs, and probably healthier too."
Can't live without greenies,My cavalier king charles spaniel and a friend's beagle can't survive without greenies!!!  Fantastic product and great seller...
Delicous Dark Chocolate,These dark chocolate truffes are the best dark chocolate I have had anywhere and the price is right.
Great Breakfast flavor!,"So, somehow Diamond captured the perfect flavor of french toast without all the calories. Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that ""Almond"" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.<br /><br />Now: To Diamond please rename to ""Buttery French Toast"", as this would be much better fitting."
Great buy on Licorice herbal tea,"Another product the puget consumer's co-op no longer carries. I am very glad to find it here for a very good price. This herbal tea is very good quality and is packaged to stay fresh, more so than it was in the bulk bins in the store.<br /><br />I use it in my version of chai or Yogi tea: with Fennel, ginger, cinnamon stick, whole cloves, fenugreek, cardamom seeds, cloves<br /><br />good drink for congestion, gas, asthma, or just tastes good. The licorice makes it sweet and is somewhat stimulating when you have a cold or congestion, but can also raise blood pressure if you use too much, so watch out if that is a problem for you"
Extremely good!,"It's already been said over and over, but these are SO much better than canned. I honestly can't eat canned because they taste so bad but I love these! The best part? They're ready in like 5 minutes :-)"
great substitute,I try to find different snacks for my girlfriend who is gluten intolerant. She really likes these and I have had a few myself and think they taste pretty good too!
Cats love it,"The box was mangled, I don't know if it was the shippers fault or the packers fault, but man o man I can't believe the cans did not get squished."
Dogs love it.,"This is the ""all gone"" treat after dinner.  It's the only treat that the dogs work for; and I did run the chance of losing a hand.  They know a new command now:  ""be gentle"" when taking liver treats."
Delicous!,"sent them for my birthday, received them and they were delicous. All my friends keep asking me to bring them more.<br />Even though they said it was going to be shipped cool, when i got them the cool packs were room temperature, nothing melted or was messed up. I just put them in the fridge and went about indulging in them . :) happy, they've lasted for three days so far and still got plenty left. :))"
Not what I expected,"I searched for a coffee that was not extra bold. This is not listed anywhere as ""extra bold"" yet that is what arrived at my door. Stuck with it, I've been drinking it, but not at all enjoying it. I will not buy another of this brand because now I just don't trust it."
arrived not sealed,needed to be returned back to amazon. Was not sealed properly. Spilled all over box and then apartment. What a mess.
Delicate Hazelnut Wafer Cookies: Magnificent!,"These are essentially the yummiest, most delicate wafer cookies I've come across. The hazelnut tastes exactly like Nutella, perfect. Each little cookie is 0.5 Weight Watchers points, which is terrific for those of us watching our figures. I usually have four cookies (2 points) with my tea and am VERY satisfied. They taste so decadent. I'm going to try the Lemon next and hopefully will be able to track down the Espresso flavor!"
A bowl of cartilage,"I heard about Miracle Noodles on Dr. Oz recently and couldn't resist trying them out, because they were touted as a delicious low carb alternative to pasta. Yes, I'd read the reviews and heard a lot of horror stories about how weird they tasted and smelled, but in spite of the negative reviews, I still got a pack of these because I'm a fan of all things Asian and figured that the poor reviews were from people not used to exotic food.<br /><br />Well, I tried them and can now render my verdict. You know that saying, ""The truth between two extremes lies somewhere in the middle?"" Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to people's reactions to these noodles. They are neither what the haters make them out to be nor at all what the ravers claim that they are.<br /><br />Let's talk about the negative reviews first. Contrary to what so many people are saying, Miracle Noodles do not have a pungent fishy odor or the texture of squid, calamari, or rubber bands. When I first opened the bag I had to really sniff for a ""fishy"" smell, since it was barely discernible. However, I did smell something else, a mild aroma not unlike that of sweetened soy milk. Not to worry, as these smells easily disappeared when rinsing and boiling the noodles.<br /><br />As for the texture? Not at all ""rubbery"", but very... gelatinous. At first I thought it was similar to those chewy fruity bits you often find in Asian puddings and drinks. But after chomping on the noodles for awhile, the texture became unmistakeable-- it was like cartilage. And no, this is not an exaggeration. The noodles had the exact semi-gelatinous, semi-crunchy consistency of cartilage. Did the texture make these noodles inedible or the worst thing ever? Not at all. Just very... jarring.<br /><br />What about the rave reviews claiming that this product is a perfect substitute for fettucine or other types of pasta? No way, Jose. Because their texture has a ""fleshy"" quality to it, Miracle Noodles are more suitable as a vegetarian substitute for meat, fish, and poultry dishes, especially since they absorb flavors so well. (When I poured oyster sauce on mine, they really did taste like a seafood-like dish.) But as a replacement for pasta? Good Lord, no. Not in a million years. I can see someone hankering for these if they want to have something in lieu of meat, but there's no way someone would be craving these in lieu of pasta. There are no similarities whatsoever between the two.<br /><br />So basically, don't believe the hype about this product, because it's definitely been mismarketed to the wrong eaters. Miracle Noodles do have some potential as a staple in the diet of someone either foregoing meat altogether or trying to cut down on it. But as a substitute for pasta or carbs? Not a chance."
ez sweetz,"I read the reviews before purchasing this item and its true its not as sweet as the company claims. One drop doesn't equal one packet of splendia regardless of which size you buy. It takes two drops to equal one packet even when you use the tiny size bottles.<br /><br />But I don't care!!!! It's awesome. NO CARBS!! I use it in my ice cream maker, in my coffee, cooking etc. I love this product and the price too. Plus, if you go to their Facebook page they have a 30% coupon which I used."
Kind of meh.,"I'm a long-time coffee drinker.  I don't suffer from chronic stomach acidity, so I can't attest to it's effect on tender stomachs.  What I CAN do is attest to the smoothness and flavor, which weren't anything to write home about.  It did seem to lack acidity, so I suppose those with tender stomachs could drink this with little worry.  The question is, should they bother with this?  I don't think so.  Stick to tea or do without.  The taste doesn't justify the bother to make it low acid."
Reidel Wine Sreies is Great!,Riedel Wine Sreies is the best value out there for wine lovers.  The unique shape of each glass for different varietals and types of wine truly enhance the wine drinking experience.  Delicate rims and the fluted stem are an elegant touch.
What the #@$%%?,"I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the 0 Calorie description.  I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch (or dressing for that matter).  I can't believe that two reviews imply that this stuff has flavor.  Well, that's true, but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one."
Tasty,"These brownies were super easy to make, and tasted really good!  I would recommend to any low carb dieter in need of a chocolate fix!"
Strong Carob Taste,"Many of my friends love this, which is lucky for me because I foolishly ordered the 6 pack. The price was so much better buying 6 and I was sure I'd love anything chocolate (I always have). The 3 star rating is because of the friends who like it--for me it would have been a 1 because I really don't enjoy the taste of carob and that's what I smell and taste in this drink. I didn't want to say anything negative about this, it's a fine product as long as you like carob, but thought it would be a good idea to warn people in case you're thinking of ordering 6 of them and you don't care for carob."
Best coffee,"My family is full of coffee snobs.  If you like robust coffee and use k-cups, this is the product for you."
Taste like Hot Wings,"I can't give these a 5 because the ingredients show they are very processed.  I'm not sure how healthy they are.<br /><br />But the taste is great - very hot  - like about a nuclear on the Zaxby's scale.  If you like hot wings, you'll like these.  Be prepared to not be able to leave them alone.  When my husband buys a bag, we sit there and eat them until they are gone.  Also, have something to drink handy!"
Great Pretzels,"I love the Newman's pretzels, both the wheat and the spelt versions.  Not too salty and very crisp."
great for school lunches,I send this for my son's lunch.  He is on the gfcfsf diet for autism and he enjoys this as a milk sub.  Amazon's subscribe and save makes it affordable.
CHANGED FORMULA MAKES CATS SICK!!!!,"As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!"
Yummy,"Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time."
Think Thin White Chocolate,"The one thing I do not like is the chemical aftertaste I get. But, I know this is what all bars of this type taste like this. I like the variety of flavors these bars come in and the convenience. The high protein makes it a good snack to tide me over until I can eat a meal. But it takes me 45 minutes to eat an entire bar because it is so sweet. I think I will stick to more natural snacks. I would buy these again though if they were on sale. I do appreciate the many products out there for people like me with celiac."
OMG!  This is sooooo good!,"The name of the flavor sucked me in to try it, but this is even better than I expected!  I'll be ordering much more of this very shortly!"
Dogs not interested,"My dog are so uninterested in this that it might as well be invisible.  I even put liver treats in it and tried to show them how to play with it.  Neither dog would bother with it at all. (One is Female 4 yr old greyhound/lab/shephard mix, other is female 4 month old lab/border collie mix - both are very playful & love treats)<br />Very disappointed."
Bo loves it!,"I love giving my dog Bo a variety of dog foods so that he does not get bored with the same taste day after day. Sometimes when I give him a new dog food to try he will turn up his nose and walk away. When I poured the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food into his bowl, he dug right in! Bo didn't stop eating until the bowl was empty. Bo's review for this dog food is 5 stars - he loves it!"
Lots of dogs getting sick from this product (including mine),"Be sure to do your homework re: this product before purchasing.  I have three dogs, and they were all getting sick once Canidae changed their ""formula"" late summer to early fall.  Once I googled the product and read the many complaints, all with dogs with the same symptoms, I immediately took my dogs off of the food, and they've been healthy again since.  I'll never trust this product again, and had been a loyal customer for 3+ years."
Most addictive snack ever,"We have come very close to ordering cases of these mangoes when we've visited Hawaii - this is a far cry from the hard, somewhat-sweet mangled slices we've seen in our local health food stores. Beautiful, delicious, perfectly sweet and zingy."
Did nothing for me.,"I decided to try this, and bought a bottle since I was up from 8:30am on a Sunday, and had to work a double (4am -Midnight and Midnight - 8am), and wouldn't be home till around 9am.<br /><br />It has a horrible taste.  I gagged and chugged down some water hoping to get rid of the taste.<br /><br />I chugged it around 5am, hoping the ""5 hour"" energy drink would last till I get home.<br /><br />Felt absolutely zero pick up, zero energy.  Didn't work for me."
Price close to double retail,"Rating 1 star due to price. Too pricey. Loved the coffee, but average price on k-cups is typically 50 to 60 cents per k-cup. Paying $1.18 per k-cup is outrageous (I thought I was getting a 2 pack for the price, my bad). Amazon has many 2 packs of k-cups for this price. Will pay closer attention on future k-cup purchases. Will not purchase this product at this price again."
Celery Leaf and Stalk,"The celery leaf and stalks dried, contain a wonderful flavor.  I use this product in meatloaf, soups and many other meals.  Dried celery is convenient for cooking and storage.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001BGTV2"">Celery Leaf and Stalk, 2 oz.</a>"
Terrible. Don't buy.,This tea tasted awful. I was recently in Turkey and looking for a Turkish Apple Tea that I can drink at home. This stuff was terrible. I had to throw it out after the first teabag.
Yummy,Without a doubt this is the best snack I have ever had.  Beware: I can eat a large bag at one sitting and usually do.  I am on the auto ship for one box a month.  I  usually place an extra order.  Watch out these can be addictive.  Do not like the vegie ones.
Good Espresso,"I been using pods from Starbucks and could never get a really good crema and decided to give this a try.  I must say, it is very good, not too bitter.  The crema is excellent on the Delonghi EC155 Espresso Maker.  Once the can is opened, we put it in the freezer to keep it fresh.  We use the Starbucks pods on the weekday for convenience and Lavazza on the weekend."
Tea ruined with hair in packaging,"This is the most expensive loose tea I have purchased so far.  I have not strayed from the Davidson's loose bulk here on Amazon at such a great price but thought I would give this one a try.  The tea itself looks nice - partial leaves, better quality leaves than what I had seen so far out of other cheaper teas.  The taste is decent as well.  I do however have a HUGE problem with stray hairs in my loose tea.  The first time I scooped some out and noticed a long hair (and not the color of mine) in with the tea I was grossed out but thought ""Hey it happens"".  The second time I found another hair down further in the bag (oddly enough a different color and longer) it completely repulsed me.<br /><br />This isn't bad tea, but I would say there's a quality control problem in filling the bags.  Needless to say that I won't be buying this brand any more and back to Davidson's cheaper (and hair free) tea for me!"
This instant noodle? Grand delicious taste!,"I read the reviews about this brand's instant noodle and they all praised FF. So I bought 2 bowls for trying the taste to see if it's also my type of gourmet. WOW, what a huge surprise! This instant noodle really deserve to be sold in bowls coz it is exactly different from most of the instant noodle taste. I love the shrimp flavour, the yummy soup and the firm black bowl. I washed both bowls and keep than for my other noodle. They are really good look bowls and miscrowaveable! What a practical unit! You taste the gourmet instant food and get a firm soup bowl that is reusable!<br />  I love FF instant noodle. After my first 2 units FF, I made an order of 16 bowls white square bowl FF today and I can't wait till receive it. Hope this flavour taste even better than the black one.<br />  You should also try FF noodle coz you will lovin't! And you can see how the FF tastes much more delicious than any other instant noodle you've tried!"
Complete waste of money,This is nothing more than a cardboard box with a little dry adhesive on the outside. It does nothing to attract flies and the adhesive is not gluey enough to trap them if they do happen to land on it. Save your money.
Treat Kellog's Fiber Plus like TOXIC WASTE PLUS!,"This product is falsely advertised by Kellogg's as some kind of ""Healthy Snack"", using words like ""Antioxidants"" and ""35% Fiber"" on the packaging.<br /><br />After reading the ingredients, you will realize it is nothing other than POISON!! It contains several kinds of Hydrogenated Oils, Artificial Flavors, Colors, Polysorbates and other questionable ingredients.  Tell Kellogg's ""NO THANKS"" by boycotting its poison!"
awesome!,"This is the best gluten-free pancake mix that we have found.  It is not a rice base which is nice for a change.  We really prefer Pamela products in general.  My daughters are excited to be able to eat good pancakes again.  you don't even notice that they are not ""regular"" pancakes."
Highly Recommened A Must Try,"Either while conducting business or simply entertaining at my office, a cup of coffee is always extended as token of friendship or goodwill and I have yet to find anyone who does not love the Kahlua K-cup. At first, it could be perceived as politeness on their part; however, guests often follow-up with requests for a second cup at a later time or mention that they have purchased some for themselves.<br /><br />I strongly recommend giving it a try and if the taste does not suit your palate, offer a cup to your guests and exchange opinions until your supply runs out. In any manner it is put to good use.<br /><br />Please note: while the product is named ""Kahlua Original,"" it is still coffee and does not possess the same syrupy, chocolaty, sweet taste the liquor has. Nevertheless, we have found it to be a great cup of coffee sweetened or with cream.<br /><br />Enjoy."
"Tastes great, less filling","Inca Cola tastes great.<br />However, you only get one 20oz bottle,<br />Not the four 20oz bottles as advertised."
Kicking your Butt,"This is the best stuff, it may not make you crazy with energy, but your focus and general energy is elevated for hours."
Larabar Fruit & Nut Raw Bars,This is my favorite Raw Bar. I cannot believe the price!! I see these bars for up to $2.00 per bar. I do automatic shipment on this product and get 15% off plus FREE shipping. I love them! Thanks!<br />Melissa :-)
great,"Since I've started buying groceries at amazon I have discovered ""taste great"" is a pretty subjective thing.  That's obvious since everyone has different tastes, but even so I wonder about some of the great reviews on some things.  So I bought this because it was on sale with the 20 dollars off deal and didn't actually expect to enjoy the milk.  I bought the regular milk and this chocolate.  Well, I'm pleasantly surprised to say it actually does taste great.  The milk does have a very very slight different taste from milk you would get in your supermarket, but in no way does that take away from the milk.  I drunk it when it was over room temp and then when it was cool.  It tasted better cold, but it wasn't bad warmer either.  So I guess Horizon can consider me a convert to their milk and I will certainly buy again before the sale is off."
EEWW!,"Leaves nasty gunk on ones fingers, totally cruddy. Not that healthy either. They are pretty good though. All in all I would recommend it if you don't care for health and if you like to suck on your fingers."
Tasty stuff IMO,"I find this stuff very drinkable on a daily (and several times a day) basis. I have purchased a fair amount of this by now, the most recent batch from Amazon. Good stuff for ""large brand name"" coffee."
Gone down hill,"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame."
Danish Cookie Review,These are very hard to find and very Danish Tradition. Yummy ! Hope you enjoy them as much as we did.
Great Find!,"Best gluten-free candy I've tasted.  Hope to see them in more stores, until then I guess I'll order from Amazon"
Excellent,I am a firm believer in the health benefits of Hemp.  This product is the best I've found.  The delivery was very prompt and efficient!
I was disappointed.,"The dark chocolate truffle flavor overpowers the coffee flavor.  Not the best combination of chocolate and coffee.  The flavors compete against each other, don't blend well, and leave an unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />Dark chocolate and dark coffee are two of my favorite things, however Gevalia did not capture the potential of this blend very well.  I wouldn't buy this coffee.  It sounds wonderful, but the actual experience was a letdown."
Excellent Formula,"I am a physician and very aware of the importance of breastfeeding. I breastfed exclusively until my son was 5 months old and then very reluctantly because of work and travel started him on formula. I did extensive research on all types of formula and decided on Earth's Best organic sensitivity formula because of a family history of lactose intolerance. I have to say I am very pleased with the product. My baby loves it and has not had any issues what so ever. To my profound dismay, he actually tolerates a lot better than my own milk. There is no spitting, no vomiting, no constipation or loose stools. I highly recommend this formula."
Green Mountain Dark and Extra Bold Dark Magic,"both work very well in a Keurig brewing system.<br />i noticed a few others had mentioned the smooth<br />taste strong taste for this blend.<br /><br />i agree. for a strong coffee, it is smooth<br />and has a minimum of the acidity others have<br />at this level.<br /><br />good drink! i cheat and use milk or cream by<br />the way."
unhappy with Very Asia,"I am glad you ask for a review of this product.  The Cafe DuMonde is excellent but the company that ships it for you leaves a lot to be desired.  Of the 6 cans we received, 3 of them were badly dented in and it did not happen in shipping because the box was in excellent condition.  This leads me to beleive that they were dinged that badly when they were packed.  If I had ordered them all for gifts, they would not have been suitable.  I then called the company to let them know I was unhappy with the condition of the cans received and I left messages at least 3 times with my name & phone number and none of those calls were returned.  I will not ever order this product again through Amazon and I think you should check into this since it is a reflection on Amazon as well."
hot spicy yummy,"I love spicy and this is a little too hot for me.  Both my husband and son love it, it livens up every dish.  It arrived well packaged and in a timely manner."
My dog doesn't like...,"These treats sounded great, but unfortunately my dog doesn't really care for them.  I offered them to my cats and they didn't really want them either.  Maybe my pets are just being picky.  My dog does love Zuke's PB & Blueberry treats though!"
Lavazza Coffee,"Just made the first pot this Saturday morning for the wife and myself.  Used a burr type coffee grinder and used my drip type coffee maker.<br />Used (3) scoops for 10-cups of coffee.<br />The aroma was great, the brew was dark and rich and the taste was superb.<br />So good as a matter of fact that we made an additional pot.<br />If you like a hearty and fulfilling cup of coffee I highly recommend this coffee."
Excellent,We don't even make chili anymore without this packet of spices.  The chili gets rave reviews every time.
Gloria Jeans Hazelnut K cups,"I absolutely love this k cup coffee,i've tried quite a few k cup flavors and always return to Gloria Jeans Hazelnut. You can't purchase it for less anywhere, that's a plus. Guests who prefer regular coffee not flavored comment that it's very enjoyable, not overpowering. Thanks for making these k cups available."
The best salmon out there,"This is the only way I can get my daughter to eat fish.  I often add extra coconut oil and cinnamon to improve the taste though.  She didn't like it the first time, but after a few attempts she enjoys it.  She screams when I try to feed her any other brand of salmon, and so I think this one is worth a try.  If they don't like it, just mix it with something they do like. Great ingredients, great product."
Great way to sample coffee flavors,"I ordered 2 of the sample pacs sent to my sister who was expecting a large number of guests, including me.  We really enjoyed trying the different coffees.  There were choices to everyone's specific tastes."
"Great, but $$$$","The product was great, my baby loves them and has no problem eating the fruits or vegetables. I tried all the flavors and they are all tasty. The only problem is that when I came back to Amazon to reorder, the price went up for the case. Now it is actually cheaper to buy them at fresh and easy. When the pricing per jar is in cents, a $3 price increase for the case makes a big difference."
convenience packs rock!,"I'm writing about the single serving convenience packs, offered in a 24-count case, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J05MM2"">OFXW116 Walkers Shortbread Fingers Cookies, 2 Cookies/Pack, 24 Packs/Box</a>, which are also available with Subscribe and Save.  They're amazing!  Here's why:<br /><br />1  Yes, as everyone says, these Walker cookies are exceptional.  You may think it's all just buzz, but if you haven't tried them, don't judge us as silly until you do (!).<br /><br />2  But what happens if you open a box -- you finish it, right!  BAD.  These little suckers aren't the greatest thing for you, to put it mildly.<br /><br />3  Answer:  single serving packaging!!  It really works.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I'd always have a box on hand in case of unexpected guests -- at least, I'd think I had one, but the box would usually have disappeared unexpectedly whenever I went to look for it.  True confessions:  I love them too and was occasionally looking to sneak some for myself!  So having them around just in case was a bad, BAD idea.  But a case of 24 packs of 2 cookies per package is ideal.  Two seems to satisfy my husband's craving -- he almost never takes more than one packet.  And I open a packet occasionally and make 2 cookies last 2 days, instead of a whole box lasting almost forever and my worrying that they'd go stale or attract ants.<br /><br />Bonus:  they're easily packable!  When my husband's expecting an exceptionally tough day at work, I'll usually sneak a pack into his lunch if he hasn't already appropriated one for himself.<br /><br />And when he's especially wiped out at the end of an unusually demanding day, a pack of these really seems to perk him up and help him muster strength for tomorrow.  He brings it upstairs while he's watching TV and waits a while before opening the bag and savoring his treasure.  Whether for lunch or after dinner, the gleam in his eye as he talks about how wonderful it is to have a treat when he's so stressed means a lot to me, especially when I know he's only eating in moderation instead of wolfing down ten or twenty servings at a time.  The case of 24 has lasted us 3 months already -- a pleasant surprise, given that there are 2 addicts in the house.  :  So our portion-control strategy is working!!!<br /><br />And yes, when we had guests who chose after-dinner tea, these were just the right thing to bring out with it, and I didn't mind opening multiple packs at once and putting the cookies together on 1 plate for serving, knowing that I wasn't either spoiling an entire box, or promoting too rapid consumption of it, just by providing our guests with a few.<br /><br />I wish two other treasures came in single-serving packets:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S"">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8WI1Q"">Mary's Gone Crackers, Caraway, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>!!<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED."
"Really easy, good, fat free!  Versatile and fast!","I love these dried refried beans.  I just add whatever seasonings I want like ground cumin, ground coriander, garlic, onions, be inventive and use your imagination!  Very easy and quick cooking.  You could even make these in a hot pot.<br /><br />My only problem is that I would like it if they would print directions for making smaller amounts of these than making the entire package at once.  They have a convenient zipper closure on the bag so that means they know that people may not make up the entire package at once.  I looked on their website and found that you just have to add equal parts water and bean mix.<br /><br />I am going to get some dried pinto beans and cook them and add these to them to be more like what I had in Mexico years ago.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had these for Subscribe & Save so I could get an even better price and have a regular supply.<br /><br />Amazon, please start carrying Santa Fe Bean Co. whole dehydrated pinto beans too!"
Uh oh,"This shampoo has a silky, smooth texture and a clean, fresh smell. However.<br /><br />After about a half dozen washes, my scalp started to itch like crazy. No shampoo has ever done that to me before. After reading the other amazon.com reviews I notice at least one other user had skin problems with this shampoo. Fair warning: it's not for everyone."
Sugar Free Bears,"They are exactly what I've been looking for. Ever since I found them at whole foods in the Bulk Food area I've loved them. The whole foods by me stopped carrying them so I searched on Amazon and found them.<br /><br />These bears do taste exactly the same as regular gummy bears.  Most people who try them can't tell the difference, but after a while you will start being able to taste the artificial sweetener. Given enough times between ""servings"" you'll never tell.<br /><br />Now mind you this is not a ""oh since it sugar free I can eat as much as I want""  item. This requires moderation. The artificial sweeteners in any diet or sugar free item will usually make people sick, with either runs or gas.  Except for very few people, you have to control how much you eat of this or you will get sick.<br /><br />This food is mainly for diabetics and people who can't have sugar in their diet. They usually control how much they eat of these types of items anyway. Otherwise if you can control how much you're eating at one time and not just using it as a replacement for Regular gummy bears, so you can eat more, this is an excellent item.<br /><br />And yes since this is Haribo they will have the extra stiffness most people have come to love about this particular gummy company."
Best overall Pod coffee,"I have a Gevalia pod coffee maker with 6, 8 and 12oz. cup choices. Most of the pods I try need two pods for any size larger than 6oz. This makes a robust but not better 12 oz cup. And to boot it's cheaper than the other pod coffee brands. The senseo pods  are useless if you want a man sized mug. At the price of most pod coffees {$12.99 to $19.99) using two pods per cup is not cost efficient. I only wish Marley Coffee had more blends to choose from."
Best Cheddar Popcorn EVER!!!,"I consider myself a foodie and am always trying to find the best of everything.  I tried Dale and Thomas popcorn when it was one of Oprah's favorite things and yes, it was good.  My local Costco store had the Popcornopolis people in-store for a few days and I was IMPRESSED.  The zebra (white and dark chocolate drizzled) was really great but the cheddar was like none other I have ever tasted.  WOW.  It has to be good if it says ""Why is this popcorn so good?"" on the back of the bag with an explanation.  Oh and two thumbs up for the perfectly sized, individually sealed cones.  I can eat one cone in one sitting (and they aren't tiny!) and can stop there.  It is a good limit-setter.  :)"
DARTS,"your pictures are unrealistic your description it is very dodgy, your dart are bad quality"
Best snack and lunch box filler,"I really love these Clif fruit ropes and so does my son.  They're easy to pack and not at all messy to eat.  He finds the sour apple a little too sour but I love all the flavors.  For traveling, you can't beat these as a snack. For lunchboxes, they're a great ""extra"" treat without being too sugary."
Fantastic for blood sugar  type 2,This is amazing for me has lowered my blood sugar around 30 to 40 points from around 140 to the low 100's does taste a little like an apple yes it does have a plastic texture but softens as you chew it really quite good not un-pleasant at all for me.<br />Try it you just might like it !
Best nylabone for my dogs,Easy to say these are my two 50 lb dogs' favorite chew toy.  Nylabones and Kongs are the only thing that last a few months with them.  Have tried other Nylabone shapes and sizes and this is their favorite and my favorite by far.  Don't have issues with them getting chunks off of this unlike some of the hollow ones.
Coconut lover's dream,"This coffee is rather mild, but if you like Coconut in most foods and drinks like some people do, then you'll probably like this too.  The only complaint I have is that it's not always available, being more of a seasonal flavor and somewhat overpriced."
Koala's March Cookies - Delicious!,"Koala's March (that's actually the name in the yellow box, you'll occasionally find packaging with this written in English) are absolutely delicious. The outside of the cookie kind of tastes like a really thin fortune cookie - basically just a very sweet and crunchy cookie. The inside milk chocolate is sweet, but not so sweet that it's overpowering like a lot of chocolate tends to be. It's incredibly smooth and the texture over all is great. If you're trying to find these IRL (if Amazon is out, or if you're just looking for them quickly), they're available in a lot of Asian markets. No asian market where you live? Try a store like Wegmans if you're on the east coast, or something similar (Maybe a Krogers elsewhere?) in the Asian food section. They do seem to be consistently at the Wegman's I've visited. (Erie PA has them every time I've gone.) If you're on the fence about them, I'd recommend trying 'em out. If you like chocolate, you'll like these."
COLUMBIAN DECAF,SINCE I SWITCHED FROM REGULAR COFFEE TO DECAF I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING A COLUMBIAN DECAF I LIKED.<br />THIS OPNE SATISFIES ME NICELY.
So aromatic and yummy!,"Toast 1/4 cup of this mustard seed over medium heat [no oil needed] in a non-stick pan for about two minutes (shaking the pan every so often to evenly toast) and then let it cool and GRIND it in a spice grinder or mill! HEAVENLY!<br /><br />Mustard seed is not only delicious but soooooo good for you because it contains selenium, tryptophan, omega 3 fatty acids as well as phosphorus, manganese, magnesium, dietary fiber, iron, calcium, protein, niacin and zinc [information via WHFoods: Mustard Seed].<br /><br />This mustard seed makes an excellent part of a spice rub on chicken and pork and grilled veggies.<br /><br />YUM!"
Beautiful machine,"I purchased this for a small hair salon, It is quieter than my home brewer.<br />Have not had it long enough to test durability but the first thing I noticed was how heavy it was, seems like 30 pounds... Waiting (hoping) for my home unit to break so I can replace it with the B155"
great taste,"this product is great tasting and you don't even need sugar or creamer, but if you like sweet coffee i'd say a little sugar and creamer would not hurt, this is a perfect product to wake up to every morning :)"
Nice flowers great price,I ordered these flowers for my mom when she was in the hospital.  She got them within a few days.  She said they were beautiful and plentiful.
So so.,"Thought these would look cool on our son's birthday cake.  I am an experienced decorator but I just wasn't impressed by the strips.  In the end, I really don't care for any edible images."
YUM!,"I love the whole Starbucks experience: the toasty warm cafe, the smell of coffee brewing, sitting and relaxing with my drink at one of their tables and reading the paper.  I did not think I would enjoy starbucks at home.<br /><br />But I was able to bring my favorite coffee shop home with me, and I really enjoyed it. I just brewed a pot and my house smells like a cafe.  Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee is so yumm! You can actually see the vanilla in the ground coffee! It is sooooo good! On my way to go get another cup now!"
Yum! And okay for my blood sugar,"Out of all the energy bars on the market, this is the one that really keeps my blood sugar from skyrocketing. The mix of fruit and nuts really satisfies my hunger. The fruit and nut bar has 180 cal, healthy fat from the nuts, low in salt and a good source of fiber. Best of all its delicious and lacks that protein powder taste some of the other bars have."
Perfect Breakfast Blend,This is my house's go to breakfast blend coffee.  Not too strong- but not weak we find the flavor very enjoyable and it a nice middle of the road coffee for guests.  My wife likes with cream and sugar but tastes equally at home black.  Doesn't seem to have a ton of pep- I can drink multiple cups in a sitting.  A little planning ahead (2 days with FREE PRIME shipping) and this package is a much better deal than the big boxes or supermakets.  Highly recommended.
great decaf coffee!,"Wolfgang Puck coffees are very good. This particular flavor of decaf is delicious - doesn't taste like decaf at all, very rich & flavorful. Also, this was a very good value for the price. I've recommended this product to several friends."
"Great for Tapenade, Hummus or Other Spreads","Lately, I have been on the prowl for Greek products in part to help the Greek export economy in a time of crisis. I was happy to stumble upon these rusks. They are great for serving tapenade, hummus, or cheese. If you are having a party, they are the perfect size for a Hors d'oeuvre tray."
Breathe Better and Better Breath!,"I bought this for someone who had a cold, and it really helped them breathe better.  It is very HOT!"
GREAT coffee in a self-contain package,"I love a good cup of coffee but hate to brew a pot or even brew one cup in a pot.  Marley Coffee gives me the option I have been looking for.  Coffee in a bag - you know, like a tea bag!  The coffee comes in a 15 single serve pods.<br /><br />While the box doesn't state that it is to be used in a one cup brewer or as a ""tea bag"", I tried it both ways.  It brews a great cup of coffee either way.  In fact, I brewed the bag in a one cup brewer first and then saved it for the next day.  I then tried it as a ""tea bag"" and even having been used previously, it brewed a great cup of coffee, dark and rich.<br /><br />I normally put milk/cream in my coffee but I found I liked it black.  WOW!  Even my picky husband liked the taste.<br /><br />I did note the box mentioned KICKS FOR CAUSE FOUNDATION.  It is nice to see a company care about our children.  They believe children should be able to be children so they started this soccer program.  Good for them.<br /><br />Good coffee and a children's program sponsor all in one product!  Go for it!"
Love it!!!,"This is great popcorn my two year old daughter loves it as well, it is the only kind she will eat!"
"Buttery, Delicious, Wonderful!","These are simply the best pretzels I've ever eaten. Just a touch of salt, buttery, crunchy. OK, now really, are you sure they're gluten free???? OMG, so good. The ones with the sesame seeds are amazing too but I liked these a lot better. Pop one in your mouth with a square of dark chocolate. The best little bite of dessert."
Tea,Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea is the best I have found.  Buying it on Amazon as a subscription is very convenient and has worked out well.
My 7 year Old's Favorite Annie's Flavor,"Annie's Mac & Cheese are the only organic and/or natural pasta mixes that I think are worth buying. Tried many flavors and I've never had a bad one.  My 7 yr. old son LOVES the Peace Noodles.  They are very garlicly, and while I like them too, I don't really care for any strangely shaped pasta -  they all have about a :30 window of cooking perfection -- too short and they are too hard, too long and they crumble.<br /><br />Also, unlike Kraft, where you can make the sauce right in the pan with the drained noodles, Annies' doesn't have as many (or any) emulsifiying type ingredients, so the sauce can get lumpy if you make it in the pan.  I have the kids mix the sauce in a separate bowl while the noodles are cooking."
"Good product, but Amazon should look at their prices.","This is a good product. I have been over all very happy with k-cups, but Amazon needs to evaluate their prices for their all k-cups. I love ordering on this site, but this is not a good deal. I could not find another way let Amazon know about this other than writing a review."
My cats love this stuff!,"One of my kitties has ear allergies, so after much research I decided to put them on a grain free diet. I purchased a number of different types of can food from the pet store. They rejected a majority of it and refused to eat it. They went nuts over this canned food, so I am now a huge fan. My pet store does not keep much in stock, so I was thrilled to find it on amazon!"
Pretty bad,"pros:<br />+ resistant to overbrewing (getting bitter) when left to steep for long periods of time<br /><br />cons:<br />- very little smell or taste<br />- cannot re-brew, even once; a good green tea can be re-brewed twice for a total of three brews<br />- about twice as expensive as my previous green tea, which is far superior in every way except for the overbrewing issue noted above<br /><br />i'm going back to my previous tea:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Yamamotoyama-Loose-Sencha-Green-7-Ounce/dp/B003XUL1MK/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1331447807&sr=8-5"
super,"Cutter Bug Free Backyard 32 is awesome. I have done as it is says on instruction, What can I say, the mosquitoes gradually appear in 3 weeks, but we still have not as much mosquitoes as we have before. I am really impress by this product. I recommend to everybody who have problem with mosquitoes."
HOW TO HALVAH,"RECEIVED THE HALVAH PROMPTLY. THE SHIPPING SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN I HAD EXPECTED. THE PRODUCT ITSELF WAS, SIMPLY, O.K."
thourghly discusted,mis ordered because of the same/simlilar name as item wanted in ability to retorn because item classes as grocery oh yes you can put it up for sale discusting gav it to neighbors dogs Merry ChristmAS wit myself eating up the cost
Delicious and Nutritious,"If you love peanut butter but don't like all the calories, PB2 is for you! Easy to mix, just add water. And it's an excellent source of protein."
Great food,My dog loooooves this  we live in uzbekistan so being here we are nervous about feeding him local dog food. even if the package says purina. so when i found this online i was happy it had other great reviews. he seems to have normal stool which is what we def wanted. his fur is super soft he does have dry skin but i think thats because we have to wash him with people shampoo ( cant ship that out here) cant wait to be stateside :-) enjoy the product its great
Stash Pomegranet Raspberry Green Tea,Delicious!  A very definite treat for the tea lover.  'Will continue to order Stash teas from Amazon.  Even my favorite restaurant does not have this one yet!
Hubby really likes it!,"I'm not big on coffee but I thought the Vanilla would make it more mild.  It definitely made it milder and I made a milkshake with it and YUM!  Hubby, on the other hand is a serious coffee drinker.  He drinks it black and he likes it strong.  He takes a thermos of coffee to work with him every day.  He tried this and says in his opinion it makes a great weekend coffee.  It's got a sweetness to it that he doesn't want to drink while he's at work but he really likes it for days when he's not going for strong, black, keep him awake coffee.<br /><br />The sweetness of it isn't overwhelming and makes for a good dessert coffee or would be good with breakfast on a cold winter morning!"
Wolf Brand Chili,"We can't get Wolf Brand Chili in Georgia, and being from Texas, really missed it. Glad to find it reasonably priced with quick shipping."
Degree Time Released Deodorant,"Degree's Silver Ion deodorant was one of the few I could use, because I am allergic to the aluminum compounds in antiperspirants in most deodorants.  Degree discontinued the Silver Ion series and I was very disappointed, but learned that the Time Released Degree replaced the Silver Ion with the silver in it.  I love it!"
yummy!,"A good drink, about 3 WW points. I mean it's about what you'd expect from an orange soda- expect it's all natural, so you recognize the things on the ingredient label.<br /><br />Downside- really a lot of calories for such a small can!"
Bring the taste of restaurant coffee home,"I have nothing against Denny's, but I don't go there to get really good (fill in the blank). It's reminiscent of countless cups of coffee at countless ""family restaurant"" chains. It's a decent compliment to an average breakfast and the price fits my budget.<br /><br />However, if I want a break from the ordinary I look elsewhere."
cheaper at Sam's,"You can get these at Sam's for about $5.50.  Although smaller, they are sweeter than many brands I have sampled. I recommend them for those who don't mind shelling nuts."
A great gift,"Mom was so happy to get this package for no special reason, just that she's Mom!  It's loaded with goodies and arrived quickly.  I highly recommend!"
The best green tea to brew!,"I bought this tea, poured some in my tea press, added boiling water and brewed. Made enough to fill a pitcher.  I drink it EVERY day and it has now become my MOST favorite flavor.  It is also my family's and friend's favorite tea to drink, whenever they are over, I pour them a glass, and then another. It has an aromatic unusually pleasant and fruity/floral flavor that is far superior to any other tea I have purchased, and I have tried very very many.  Enjoy!!  (And hide, because your visitors will make it disappear!)"
num num num,"Probably her favorite toy.  It is heavy yet she manages to walk around with it in her mouth like her prize.  She (57 lb. aggressive chewing golden retriever) works on it daily and it lasts a long time before it starts looking kind of nasty and unappetizing.  Not one single instance of even a small to medium size piece coming off, nothing ever bigger than a piece of uncooked rice.  I think it does help with scraping the teeth too.<br /><br />Her oral care routine is a little obsessive compulsive but it works.  Nylabones, CET rawhide chews, and Petz Life citrus spray.  Brushing isn't an option because of lack of patience by all involved parties.<br /><br />Great price on amazon as well."
Bear & Wolf canned salmon,This is a really good quality canned salmon. Relatives in Florida told me about it; I live in Indiana. I can use it safely for many different cooking projects. It does not smell really fishy and looks good and tastes wonderful. I was pleased to be able to purchase it from Amazon as there is no near outlet in my Indiana town. I'd have to drive at last one hour one way to find an outlet.
Try Coleslaw and French Dressings Instead!,I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.
AMAZING TREATS,"Amazing --both  my Senior dog and the new pup loves these. Quality ingredients---will break in half easily for a really small puppy.<br /><br />I've re-ordered more than once--always very fresh ""use by "" dates.<br /><br />QUALITY--"
Excellent supplement,"I use this in my protein shakes. I combine this with cacao, hemp protein, super green food supplement, and fresh or frozen fruit and it is great."
Best Brown Mustard... Ever!,"I never cared much for any of the brown mustard brands out there. Then I tried Heinz. My taste buds woke up, my eyebrow arched & a smile crept across my lips (while licking them to get every last drop)... YUM!!! This IS the brown mustard that made me LOVE brown mustard! It has a delightful, sweet spiciness that truly enhances the flavor of foods without overwhelming/smothering the flavor of your food. Now I want nothing else on my Kosher hot dogs & sandwiches with everything from salami to turkey: anything else is second rate & I would feel like I'm wasting perfectly good food by settling for anything else! Try it, you'll like it! Try Heinz & enjoy!"
"Handy, nutritious, delicious snack.  Perfect for kids on the run!","Wow!  Really tasty and perfect to grab on the go.  120 calories and nut nutrition, portable and guiltless snack.  Arrived fresh and delicious.  Great to throw in the purse for a treat on the go.  Would be great in salads.  Really good deal - bang for the buck.  Will be purchasing this often."
lots of unpopped kernels,"The Orville Redenbacher's gourmet popping corn has a great fresh flavor however we find that in our air popper, approximately 20% of the kernels do not get popped.  We have a standard air popper (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUWA"">Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper</a>) and other brands of popping corn have a much higher pop yield.  My wife greatly prefers the fresh flavor of the Orville Redenbacher to store-brand popping corn (stale taste) but she is not happy with the large quantity of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />We are going to try some other brands to see if we can find something as tasty as the Orville Redenbacher  but with a higher yield in our air popper."
Great cereal,"This is a delicious cereal even if you don't have to eat gluten-free.  However, the cereal is not fresh.  The expiration date was only a couple of months away on the batch I ordered.  It's a lot to eat in a short period of time."
Very Convenient,"Sure the price for this is a bit high compared with a half gallon from your local grocery mart, but you can't beat the convenience. I travel a lot for work and these are perfect for that scenario."
Loved by my 8 month old!,"Being an organic, health conscious family, we turned to Happy Baby for our food needs outside of the homemade foods we make.<br /><br />The banana, beet and blueberry flavors are a great combination that provides a well-balance of vitamins and nutrients children at this age need.<br /><br />Not only does my 8 month old literally beg for more with every bite, I can tell that her digestive system takes well to the hearty and top-of-the-line organic ingredients. Happy Baby = Happy Mama!"
Warning - MSG,"Yes they taste great. It is no wonder because they contain MSG in the form of yeast extract. Try Rice Works sea salt (also sold here) - they have only salt, taste even better, and are chea[per"
excellent,"After speaking to other mothers, we skipped rice cereal and went straight to oat cereal.  I found that the consistency of happy bellies oat cereal is much better than earth's best.  Also the containers are really convenient, rather than the cardboard box of earth's best."
Dynamite Fudge Cookies,"These Dare Chocolate Fudge cookies are the best tasting chocolate cookies I've found, since the Sunshine Bakery (Safeway) stopped making theirs in the 70s.  Great fudge taste and rich with flavor.  Cookies not too soft and not to hard.  Highly recommended!"
"Warning, very light roast.","Tastes and smells good, but way too light.  It says light roast, and they really mean it.  If you like dark coffee then don't get this."
Best. Kool-aid. Ever.,"I consumed a great deal of this in High School but have missed it the last few years as it has been removed from my local grocery store. I convinced my wife to let me buy this bulk amount and I am thrilled. Little note will be paid to these reviews but still I must say, you need to try this."
Pure and Delicious Iced Tea,"My wife and I have been using unsweetened iced tea for years.  It's great if you're watching your sugar, however it is rather difficult to find an instant iced tea that is absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives.  We sometimes add stevia powder to sweeten it up and it tastes absolutely delicious.  This tea mix specifically is now our favorite.  We've tries many brands, which many of them we also like, but this is the best we have found. The taste is good, it dissolves easily, and it is pure."
Might be good for you but very blah!,"While this is packaged well and convenient to open and pour out, it doesn't matter how easy it is<br />or how healthy if you can't get the baby to eat it! This is extremely blah, bland mush. I certainly<br />expected much better from this brand. In addition, since it's a stage 3 food, I expected there to be<br />pieces of meat and vegetables, however there's just a bunch of lightish brown mush my baby wont eat<br />even why I try to force it down her. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone despite it's health rating."
"Good price, but","Plus:<br />- Good deal on the price and love the convenience of free delivery.<br />- Subscribe and Save saves money.<br />- Son ate it.<br />- Not always in stock at stores so online good buy.<br />- Like the 8 ounce size containers.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />- Son gets constipated with the Rice cereal, the Oatmeal is much better.<br />- Uses to much breast milk when mixing together.<br />- If you mix by directions won't be the right consistency to feed baby.<br /><br />I would buy one package first and see how your child reacts to the Rice before you buy the pack of 6 like I did."
Great Price and Delicious sprinkles....,Jimmies sprinkles are the best i love them because they are soft and unlike the other hard sprinkles don't get stuck in your teeth. lol But it was a great buy. You have a better deal here that anywhere else.
Matcha green tea powder,I enjoy Starbuck's version w/melon flavor in latte and frapuccino. At home I just blend mine with vanilla soy milk which I think tastes awesome.
Pop Chips,Lower in calories and great taste.  I like them just as much as the regular greasy chips.  It's nice to have a great tasting healthy alternative.
"Bring these to a dog run, you'll be a super-star!","These organic cookies are my 2 dogs' MOST FAVORITE. The cookies are baked crunchy and flavorful. Because they are small-sized and easy to break with your finger tips, I use those to train my new puppy, too. They are USDA-certified organic. My 18-month Lab/Hound mix has been crazy about these cookies, and now my 3-month Lab/Pit mix puppy has found there's more yummy stuff than the dog food he's fed everyday.<br /><br />I always bring handful of those cookies when we go out for walk. When we visit a dog run, without fail, I become the instant star owner in the park, as all other dogs run toward me, asking for something in my pocket. These cookies must smell so-o-o good to all the dogs, I bet!"
I've tried ALL of them. this is the BEST.,"Awesome, this is simply the best on the market. My second favorite is the CO2, but this one is slightly more flavorful (coconut flavor) than CO2."
great price point,"GOOD POINTS:<br /> - great pricing (I got the Roland sale + subscription discounts)<br /> - well packed (heavy plastic bag inside thin metal ""paint can""-like tin<br /> - fresh & tender<br /><br />AMBIVALENT ISSUES:<br /> - the label says, ""baby ginger"", which I find hard to believe. First, the ginger has quite a lot of heat when eaten on its own. [It's now 1/2 hour after eating one slice with millky tea; my mouth still feels the heat and I am NOT sensitive to spice.] Second, about 20% is moderately to extremely fibrous. Third, the slices are medium to large, which would be alright if lengthwise, but one can see that they are crosswise (large rhizomes). None of these are qualities I associate with baby ginger. The reason I'm ""ambivalent"" is that while I think the label is incorrect, the Amazon product description does not include this, so it wasn't a factor in my purchase.<br /> - the sugar used is much coarser than usual (about 3-4x the size of US white sugar). The Australian and US candied ginger I've enjoyed in the past used extra fine sugar (US ""baking sugar""). My issue is that the coarser sugar doesn't cling and make a crust to protect the ginger, the way extra fine does. Also, about 1/3 of the pieces have unsightly clumps of sugar on them, which I remove before serving or using for baking.<br /><br />NEGATIVE:<br />- the fiber issue mentioned above is something I never encountered with Australian or US candied ginger. Unpleasant to eat and embarrassing for the hostess. Also slows down baking prep.<br />- the big crystals are mostly an esthetic issue, but there is the safety issue of one's blade catching on a crystal and the blade bouncing a little as the sugar shatters. Still trying to find a work-around for chopping and mincing.<br />- The ""paint can"" is difficult to work with. Obviously, I can remove some ginger and finesse the rest of the bag out of the can, to store as I like; but this is a 6 lb quantity packed in a resealable container: the container should be easy to re-seal and re-open. This container needs a tool to be opened; and each use renders the container harder to use--the thin metal dents and bents, so the lid is more and more misshapened. Actually, I'd prefer the packer please just seal the very sturdy plastic bag, label it for sale, and pass the savings on to the consumer.<br /><br />TO SUM UP:<br />A generally good product with great price point, but you have to invest considerable effort to get the best results. (Unless you don't mind a bunch of spiky slivers in your mouth, or your knife slipping again & again.)<br /><br />I love candied ginger as a snack, as a baking ingredient and as a ""food pharmaceutical"", so I'll be purchasing again. If this were a seasonal purchase (e.g., just for holiday baking), I'd pass and look for an easier-to-use product with more consistent quality."
Better than reviewed,"I like strong, flavorful, coffee and missed the Coffee People Organic. After reading all the reviews I ordered the French Roast. With all the warnings about packaging and looks I expected the worse. When it arrived I was surprised that it was packaged well and easy to use as any k-cup. The packaging of the pod seems more earth friendly. Most importantly, this is now my favorite brand. It tastes like a good cup of coffee should."
Spicy and sweet!,"Theo's milk chocolate coconut curry bar is not for everyone -- it is very spicy and the sting of curry powder is the highest note in the taste, at least initially.  But this is my favorite of Theo bars, not just for the spiciness, but also because the spice quickly dissipates as the chocolate melts on the tongue, and the sting is soothed by one of the best milk chocolates I've ever tasted -- silky as it dissolves.  The coconut adds a bit of crunch to the texture.  This is a highly unique bar, and very rewarding if you like sophisticated taste combinations."
Good start,"Well, This was my first EVER bonsai tree, and I liked it. I was reading other reviews, and I red about bugs. This freeked  me out, but when I got mine , The first two days were good. I got a little aluminum pan to be my water catcher thing, and around the 3rd day, I noticed ants. So then I looked online for ways to get rid of them. I tried soaking the roots for 10 minuets (like 4 different times) I didnt buy anything, or look to hard around my house for anything, I just realized. the best thing to do was just cut the roots (since you need to anywyas for repotting). That got rid of them.<br />One thing that I wish i knew ahead of time was Pruning. They say give it one growing season before re-potting, But my pot was nothing but roots. It was overflowing with roots, hardly any soil. and I got it in the winter, So i cut the roots, Re-potted, right before spring, and Man did it do amazing.<br />The ant problem was gone, but then I noticed I had Aphids. Soo, I started researching that too. So what I ended up doing was just mixing some spices I had around my house. I found the most dryest-spiciest-most fine seasonings I had, mixed it with water, and sprayd the plant.<br />That got rid of them, and didnt harm the plant at all.<br /><br />I rate this a 4 out of 5 Because, It came to me in about 6 or so days, (from Cali to Ohio) which was fine with me, but the ammount of work I needed to put in.<br />Took to long figuring out how to get rid of the ants, and aphids.<br />They had ants and aphids in the first place. But Cant really blame them. Its a plant, no bigdeal, I cought them before they could really wreck the plant.<br />Just besure for when you prune the roots.<br /><br />I tried to get better soil, and re-cut the roots right before May 1st, and now its Dead, I think I cut tomany roots.<br />But the bug problem was long gone, so I know it wasnt that. I waterd it daily, It had sun. So my guess would be the root pruning.<br /><br />But hey, I learnd alot since then, Did even more research, So<br />I recomend this Tree to anyone, Just besure you check the roots, and look for Aphids (mine were white tiny bugs, died if you touched them because theyre so soft, and I just shook the tree, and some of them fell off. Thats how I knew I even had them)<br /><br />Pardon my spelling and or grammer."
Excellint product,Great taste and flavor. Better than the movies. I purchased 3 for 1 for a great deal. Love the product.
tea has nice mild flavor,"this tea has a nice mild flavor as a hot tea.  I have not yet tried it as an iced tea.  I have not tried any other brand of this kind of tea, but am satisfied enough with this one."
I'm trying them for first time,"I like the idea.<br /><br />I've come back, increased to 5 stars.<br /><br />I ordered on May 8, no promise of quick delivery, but they arrived today, May 11, in time for the Mother's Day gift we intended.<br /><br />The orchids were quite nice and looked very fresh and like they would open up the buds and stay fresh for a long time.<br /><br />I will definitely buy some of these again, perhaps look for a plant this time.<br /><br />I've never bought fresh flowers from Amazon, but my wife bent over and whispered, ""Send some flowers to Consuelo for Mother's Day"" and here I am.<br /><br />We have loads of fresh flowers around the house, mostly from our own growing but some from the store.<br /><br />Consuelo is our housekeeper and in charge of garden and flowers.  She has her own children, but even though we are much older, we regard her as OUR mother.  Our dog also loves here. She takes him on daily walks.<br /><br />I love orchids.  Consuelo may take these home for her enjoyment there, but we will enjoy them here too.<br /><br />I will report again when I get these.<br /><br />I noted with interest there were only two reviews, one at 5 stars and one at 1 star.<br /><br />I start with a neutral 3 stars and  expect to be back with an upgrade in rating, and pictures to boot.<br /><br />Karl Loren"
The Tao of Tea,Attractive containers (3). The tea is very nice and mellow.  Easy to brew.  Not at all bitter.  One to keep.  Two for gifts! Arrived in great condition and on time! (If you are thinking the brewed tea is going to be blue or purple--it is not so.  Nilgiri Blue is referring to the tea's area of origin.)
Breeder Recommended & Cavalier King Charles Puppy Loves It!,"The breeder started our puppy on a combination of this ""small bites"" Natural Balance food along with canned food of the same type and then transitioned him into just this kibble. All the puppies in the litter love the food, and their digestion seems pretty regular. We highly recommend this food for small breed dogs with eating sensitivities and/or for people who prefer to feed their dogs a natural, grain-free diet."
Totally worth buying!,"I'm 12 weeks pregnant with my 6th child and have been plagued with all day sickness for 7 weeks. Once 8pm would hit, the severest nausea would strike, getting worse until around 3:30am. My sweet hubby bought this tea for me along with a bunch of other hopeful remedies for the hellish stomach upset I was feeling. Skeptical, I decided to give the tea a try and boy was a I glad I did. I would sip the warm tea slowly and much to my surprise it helped!!! My nausea would get so bad I didn't want anything in my stomach including liquid, but sipping this tea slowly seemed to ease the upset. It's a really comforting tea and I'm so thankful I had it!"
Perfect for those who go nuts over 'nuts.,"Planters Big Nut Bars, Double Peanut promises and delivers.  If you love peanuts and more peanuts then you'll want to pick up a box of Double Peanut bars.  A layer of peanuts sandwich with guess what????  Another layer of peanuts.  Every bite is filled with peanut goodness.  Those with allergies to legumes need not apply.  But if you're a peanut lover then by all means, go NUTS and buy some today!"
Cereal box collectables!!!!,"Been looking for the value of an unopened box of Batman cereal from 1989.  Cannot find the information.  Can you send me any info?  Thanks,  Roy  email ozzie@metrocast.net"
My dads favorite birthday gift!!!!,I buy this every year for my dad's birthday.  Thankfully I found it here on Amazon this year.  My previous suppliers stopped carrying this product.  These cakes are so delicious and my father really looks forward to receiving them every year.  This last time I called to see if he got the cakes and the card I mailed out.  He said I got the cakes and that's all that mattered.  lol!
A great tea!,This is similar to a herbal that I mix up myself from bulk teas.I now have enough to last all winter.<br />I brew it up then chill it. sometimes I add a little sweetener.
slim jims review,Stale and Thats unusual cause i get them all the time this time was waste of money very disappointed most likely will not recorder them because of this order which is a shame.
"Mmmmmm, vanilla-y goodness","I second Joanna Daneman's observation that these golden Oreos are preferable to the regular chocolate Oreos when you are in public.  Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!"
Cat loves this and it's a high quality food,"I have a 1 1/2 year old cat and started feeding him canned food after reading about how cats don't naturally have a strong thirst drive and need most of their water to come from their food like in nature. Also as another reviewer said, this food doesn't have any of the crappy by-products that ""Science Diet"" and other highly marketed brands have. These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one."
Could not ask for a better dog food,I am so happy with this! My great pyreneses could never keep weight on and I was feeding her iams. She always had a really bad odor when she was damp. Now she is full weight and smell free! Thanks to this food.
Switched:  Fool me once,I love the Donut House Extra Bold Decaf.  Best decaf of all the brands that I have tried and I have tried many.  I ordered here and expected to get what I ordered.  What I got was the light roast that was NOT extra bold.  It actually did not say Extra Bold on the label.  By this time though I had thrown the box away loading the k-cups onto the carousel. Now I know that I must watch closely and examine each and every one as I load it into my machine to make sure it is what I think it is so I am not so disappointed in the future.  I won't buy from here again.  Someone is responsible for the switch.  I expect to get what I pay for.
Best Stevia powder,"Best stevia extract powder. The price is a quarter of the price in Trader Joe's stores per ounce. I love this product. Use it in deserts, tea, coffee, smoothies, etc."
Mild and mellow decaf,We find Wolfgang Puck Swiss Water Process Decaf Blend is an excellent choice for our Senseo coffee pot. It's mild and mellow. We plan to order it again. We purchased the coffee pods at Amazon.
Where's the Gooey?,"As one could surmise by my other reviews, I'm much more into fitness than I am into high-calorie snacks. That is not to say I don't snack once in a while. That being said, I wouldn't choose these cookies for a snack. They're unbelieveably high in fat and calories and surprisingly not really that good.<br /><br />They're crumbly and dry. Where's the gooey? If I was going to waste some of my calorie intake on this, I want some satisfaction, which I just didn't get.<br /><br />The flavor is a good chocoalte flavor, but none of the expected goo. There are some great chocolate cookies out there. These are not them."
Great toasted flavor!,I have been using this product for years and it is hard to find in groceries around the Seattle area. I was pleased to see it available at Amazon. It makes an excellent breakfast cereal and cooks up very quickly in the fine grind. I have not been able to find kasha in bulk that tastes as good as the Wolff's that comes in a box.
"Not great, but not bad either.","These candies were not bad and I will probably buy again, but I was disappointed.  They are very chewy (almost tough) and just taste like an inexpensive candy.  Ironically, in the same order, I also purchased the black licorice wheels (also by Haribo) packaged in the smaller bags.  In contrast, the black licorice wheels were very fresh, moist and tasty.  I think whether or not a person likes the red wheels simply depends upon their individual taste.  If the red ones presented like the black ones (moist, fresh and very tasty), I would be very pleased.  Perhaps it would be helpful to describe the red ones as an ""ordinary"" and the black ones as ""gormet."""
Hot Sauces,Really spectacular hot and tasty sauces.  I highly recommend this product to the hot sauce lovers out there. Great taste and just the right amount of heat.
Very healthy cat food. Much better than almost any other,"This is some of the healthiest cat food on the market. It is all natural and doesn't contain food byproducts. What comes out of the can looks like real food (just below human quality) not a mash-up of mysterious goop. The fish in these cans has texture, and smells better than other cat food.<br /><br />My two cats absolutely love it.<br /><br />If you want a healthy cat food that is natural and not made in China, give these a try. I can't guarantee your cat(s) will love it as much as mine, but if they don't like it, they need to grow taste buds!"
Great Product - Biscoff Spread,Great Product!  I love this Biscoff Spread.  It tastes just like to cookies.  My package was very well wrapped and arrived in record time.  Thanks for doing such a great job.  I will definitely order from this company again - probably more Biscoff Spread!!!
EXACTLY what you'd expect,"How in the world do you review a gummy worm?  Well, I think it's all about expectations.<br /><br />Was it huge?  Yes.  About 3 feet.<br />Was it bigger than I thought it would be?  Without a doubt.<br />Was it big and heavy enough that it was slightly comical?  Absolutely.<br /><br />Consistency: Consistency is on par with other gummy candy.  In fact, I the texture is slightly tougher than the average American gummy.  It reminded me of gummy candy that I got in Germany.<br /><br />Taste: While not as concentratedly sour as candy much smaller, the sour green flavor is definitely detectable.  And pleasant as well!<br /><br />This product is exactly what you'd expect.  It is an eye-opening jaw-dropper that looks cool, weighs more than you'd think (4 lbs), tastes good, and will probably last a month of consistent eating."
Nice Substitute,"I love salt and vinegar chips, and when I found these in the store, I tried these and thought they were a great ""healthier"" substitute.  They have a nice crunch and flavor, but I think that 24 bags was overkill for me, since I am the only one in my home!  Will buy them again....just not 24 bags at a time!"
Tastes amazing!,Best one of the Planter's NUT-rition I've had. The chocolate and sesame sticks are amazing. I bought the 3-Pack for a party and it was gone in an hour.
Scorned Woman Hot Sauce,"I can only tell you that the product I buy is not for me, but for my girlfriend who loves it but unfortunately it is no longer available in Canada.  She raves about it, and I am amazed that she can go through a bottle so quickly.  So. I have found it a perfect little gift for spacial occasions.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Adeline Shoup"
Favorite Of The Keurig Coffee K-cups,"This is our favorite k-cup coffee, it is strong - and taste great (although it seems that many of the k-cups) have nearly the same overall taste..."
The Perfect Chip,"These chips are delicious. They're crispy and fresh and perfectly salted. Everything's better with salsa, but these chips taste great even naked!"
Good Price But Average Taste and Bad Ingredients,"Price on these cookies are great.  However, the taste is average.  The cookies are individually wrapped, which is nice.  But the cookies are kinda hard and meant to be microwaved for 10 secs.  It also doesn't taste much like oatmeal, but more like ginger cookie.  The texture is also not lumpy like a homemade or high quality oatmeal cookie.  It's feels like it's made more from Oat flour and the raisins r dried and small.<br /><br />I do have issue withe ingredients, specifically, Partially Hydrogenated Oils, TBHQ, and host of other ingredients that are less than natural for high consumption.  Th<br /><br />I will not be ordering any more of these.  I expected more natural ingredients from a name like Quaker.  Partially Hydrogenated Oils are not good for heart health, and TBHQ is toxic enough that companies can only put a tiny amount as preservative.  It's also used in Chicken McNuggets that many people have problems with.  I was somewhat shocked that Quaker is using TBHQ in their food.  I haven't seen this ingredient in many foods.  Maybe other companies just aren't putting it in their ingredients list."
Awesome,If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
Quaker Soft Baked Cookie,This cookie is really good and works really well for my family.  In the morning it fits in to my morning routine.  I take the cookie put it in the microwave and out the door we go with my tea.  Something I can eat at my desk or on the run.  It holds me over till lunch and is not too heavy.
THE Best Pretzels = they are better than those with gluten,MY husband cannot became alergic to gluten about a year ago and thus we have been trying all kinds of products.  These are expensive so I buy my kids pretzel's at the grocery store.  I can say these taste 10X better than any that I have had (regular / with gluten) - they have a fabulous taste.  I would recommend these if you like Pretzels - even if you can eat gluten they just taste great
Doesn't taste like a compromise,"Okay, there is something I'm not crazy about with this mix: made as directed the batter is too thick, making doughy pancakes. Even when I add extra milk, it quickly thickens up again.<br /><br />BUT, with enough extra milk and cooked before the batter can re-thicken, these really taste as good as regular mixes, better than Whole Foods' ""365"" mix (where egg is optional but you really miss it if it's not there), and 'way better than the recipes we've tried with egg substitutes. This is a blessing for my son who loves pancakes but is allergic to eggs, and for the rest of us who aren't allergic but just love pancakes on a Saturday morning."

Tasty and healthy!,We received these to try and they were fantastic my husband loves oatmeal raisin and he couldn't get enough! I think the verdict is that they're fantastic and we'll definitely be buying more!
Not too strong but not subtle either. Perfect!,"Organic, dark roast, and water processed decaf! The best you can get for your body, in moderation, of course. The flavor is great for me. I'm not into rich, robust flavors. This is a more smooth, medium flavor. Definitely not weak as others described. If rich and robust is your preference, I wouldn't recommend this one. Shipped quickly with Amazon as well."
It has a bad after taste,I didn't care for this because it had a bad after taste there are many other brands of k-cup cider that are far better then this one. You should purchase one of them.
Just sweet enough,"This tea tastes great. The peach flavor is just enough to give the tea a bit of sweetness. Its not overpowering. My pantry looks ridiculous with how much tea I have in it, and adding another big box to the collection doesn't help, but it is more than worth it for the price."

Having bought two bags... thinking I would like these very much (how right I was!)...<br /><br />I was downright impressed, while not the traditional S'mores - but gee whiz; I actually ate the whole danged bag in one sitting<br />without even realizing it! *blush*  It was so much fun hunting or is it fishing (?) for one after another and then stacking them<br />together and eating ""fishbait"" - hahahahahaha!<br /><br />Next day, began to open the other bag (already!) and started to munch away ....<br /><br />Until, my grandchildren saw the ""evidence"" and wahhh :( - Poor Grandma here - ended up having to ""share"" and goodness gracious,<br />the laughter and giggles from the little ones were far worth it all!<br /><br />I 10,000 times recommend this ... this is the best ever from Pepperidge Farms! Way to go! Now if they can come up with the big box,<br />I'd buy it on Amazon in a heartbeat! Who would ever dream that Pepperidge Farms would come up with this? Just awesome!<br /><br />Interestingly, the very next day; while I had to babysit the youngest grandchild for a short time; she went off looking for something<br />that I had to inquire what she was looking for and she kept saying Whitey, Blackie and Creamy.  Looking everywhere in my room even<br />under the bed, leaving me totally bewildered until she sulked and said<br /><br />""Grandma, where did you hide them?""<br /><br />""Hide what?""<br /><br />""The 3 goldfishies""<br /><br />(puzzled)<br /><br />""The 3 Goldfishes? We don't have Goldfish in the house.""<br /><br />(now she is mad with her arms folded)<br /><br />""Yes we do, we ate them yessteday! Grandma, where did you hide them?""<br /><br />(trying not to laugh)<br /><br />""Sweetie, we ate them all up yesterday.""<br /><br />""Grandma, buy more. I like them lots! Tummy hungry, says want more goldfish.""<br /><br />(points to her stomach)<br /><br />Kids are adorable! &lt;3  If you buy them, make sure you stash some for yourself, they are completely<br />and you just cannot resist them!"
Delightful,"After much consideration I've decided that this is my favorite flavor of metromint water.  It's a mix of orange and mint notes, very cooling in the summer.  The best part is that there's no sweeteners, fake or real.  It's just water, mint, and orange notes.  No nasty aftertaste.  This is my absolute top choice in bottled water."
mexican style babyyy,I put this flavorfull goodness on 86.42% of the food I eat at home and when I go out I find myself cra cra cra cravinggggg this stop to put on a big mac per say of the likes of chiles nachoooos. This is thee bomb. Like the one you need to try if you want to try the best most flavorfull sauce know to man. Mexicans really out did them selves here let me tell you. Straight beasting my g!
likewise,"I had the same experience, except that I do not like the canyon cut variety.  I did not receive a clear answer as to when  Amazon will know whether or not the chips in the warehouse are canyon cut vs. original cut."
"HInt of vanilla, strong roasted flavor","Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusions Ground Coffee has just a touch of natural vanilla infused into the coffee.  This results in a subtle vanilla aroma and a *very* subtle tinge of vanilla flavor in the coffee.  Perhaps it's just me, as I've never been able to discern much of the ""flavor"" in the vast majority of flavored coffees offered in coffee shops or for home brewing.<br /><br />That having been said, this Starbucks variety has a very distinct roasted aroma and makes a powerful cup of coffee.  I personally prefer a stronger roast flavor in my coffee and found this product enjoyable; if you also prefer this style of coffee then Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusions is certainly worth a try."
Kielbasa,This is the 2nd Easter that we have used these Casings for our homemade Kielbasa with great success.  We will most likely reorder again for next Easter.
I concur,"I concur. Ditto to everything everyone else has said. Good stuff. Happy happy. I make muffins regularly and this helps keep the quality along with the pricing and convenience all do-able.<br />Mine was backordered for about three weeks but I didn't mind as I was in no hurry for it.<br />First time using this and I like it very much and will use again and again and recommend. Tomorrow I will be seeing a friend and will give her a ""care package"" of a bag of this and a bag of the Bob's Golden flaxseed meal so it makes a nice gift packaging item also.<br />Thank you Bergin and Amazon!"
Bought these for a milk donor,"My daughter has had some issues with failure to thrive and other medical conditions. Because of this, I couldn't keep up with her demand and had to do something. We were fortunate enough to find some amazing women willing to donate milk to my daughter. We had been buying bags for our donors to store the milk in and finally, after buying a box here and a box there, I decided to look into some bulk options.<br /><br />I found these bags and I was a little skeptical but have been pleasantly surprised! When we go to thaw the milk, we have had far fewer leaky bags with the honeysuckle bags than with lansinoh or medela bags! Anyone who has used thawed milk knows exactly how tragic a leaky bag can be!<br /><br />Great bags and a great price!"
Delicious,"I enjoy chai tea very much and my partner drinks only tea, no coffee. So when we purchased our Keurig, we wanted to try several varieties of chai to find the perfect one. I shopped on amazon and bought several types with  reviews, cost, recognizable brand and speed of shipping being accounting factors ( in that order).<br /><br />Pros: Quick delivery<br />  The description is accurate and you get exactly what is advertised<br />  Known brand<br />  Fresh<br />  The price is moderate<br /><br />Cons: I mention price here again because it is cheaper in other forms ( tea bags)<br /><br />I prefer a non milk based Chai and so this was the ideal for me. I added sugar some days and drank it plain others and both were satsifying. My partner and I both enjoyed it above all the other flavors and I will reccomend and share with friends and family. I will continue to shop and attempt to find a better price, but would pay this again because it is worth it."
A fantastic olive oil for the price.,"I'm an American which means I don't know squat about good olive oils.  Well, that used to be true.  Now I know a little something about them that I'd like to share with you.  I was a typical person... I bought olive oil at my local grocery store but I didn't really know anything about it.  In time I learned about cold-pressed olive oil being preferred.  Next i learned a little more about the deeper concepts of olive oil.  I sampled various relatively expensive domestic brands, the kinds available at my local Harris Teeter.  But my experiences weren't very fruitful.  I simply wasn't moved.  Until I decided to give in to a wild hare and order a foreign bottle of olive oil.  And WOW!  What a difference!! Such a fruitful nose and a beautiful color.  I never knew it could be like this.  I simply didn't have a clue that this could exist.  But what I ordered was fairly expensive.  At least compared to what I could get locally.  THIS PARTICULAR olive oil was my second foree into non-domestic samples.  And not only is it better than the first REAL olive oil I tried, it's cheaper.  If you choose this olive oil you're going to pay about 30% more than what you can get locally.  With shipping costs and all.  (Minus sales tax, yay!)  But this olive oil is very high quality.  And although it costs a tad bit more that what you can buy locally, the lift in quality makes it worth it ten times over.<br /><br />I just ordered my second bottle and I see this as being something I do every 3 or 4 months."
Great fake jerkey,"This is a great jerkey substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. If you don't like your jerkey hot, I suggest you try mild or teriyaki. Otherwise, this is the stuff for you!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!"
EXCELLENT LEMON JUICE,"One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.<br /><br />I will continue buying it."
Perfect on Yogurt,I've been buying this Familia variety at the local supermarket but it's been discontinued so am very happy to see it at Amazon and get the subscription service which makes it a better deal.  A couple spoonfuls of this in a container of Chobani Black Cherry yogurt and I'm in heaven.
Next to fresh...the best.,I have not found one packaged tabouli mix to beat this one.  Can't make it fresh??? Use this and let it sit for a couple hours for the best taste.
Nonpareille versus Pareille - Roland Knows Best!,"A question as old as these capers themselves! How often have you stood in your local bodga pondering the difference. I have news for you, everyone thought you we stoned. Standing there for 30 minutes staring at a jar of capers. You should be glad no one called the cops.<br /><br />As my German friend once translated for me, Nonpareilles is called a quality class of the Caper, it concerns the smallest ones (and best ones). These are in the taste without resembling. Likewise very small dear beads for instance on Schokoladenpl&auml;tzchen are called Nonpareille.<br /><br />mmmmmm,Schokoladenpl&auml;tzche"
The only no-carb gum option,"I purchased Falim because I was looking for a completely carb-free gum. I didn't want a sugar-free gum with sweeteners.  I just wanted something to chew on when I was craving something. That is exactly what this is. It is virtually flavorless, completely sugarless gum. Once in a while you can taste a bit of a piney flavor but overall it's just like a normal piece of gum that has lost it's flavor.<br /><br />There are 5 small pieces in each pack so you get 25 pieces of gum for the price which is a little steep when you include shipping.  So, if you know you will use it, I recommend buying in volume to bring the overall cost per piece down by sharing the shipping cost among numerous packs."
I hope they are as good for you as they taste!,"As far as the ingredients are concerned, the chips do seem healthier than regular chips. BBQ flavor is my favorite.  Be careful they are addicting and you could eat a whole bag if you were really hungry.  I haven't yet but i've eaten half a bag."
Popular with some - not me,"All natural beef, but too soft for my taste - doesn't have the 'snap' and drier outer surface that some like.  This is a matter of personal taste - the product is good, just not for everyone.<br />I suggest trying this company's old fashioned cold-smoked beef-sticks.  Strong hickory flavor, a good bite of spice, and drier texture.<br />This company has superb customer service!"
To Live For!!! I agree.,"I believe this is the first occasion I have used the word ""beautiful"" to describe the taste of something. This oil taste beautiful. I love it !!!!!!!!"
My dog thrives on this,"I have a 10 year old Aussie shep/heeler mix with chronic skin allergies -- I tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas -- and none helped.  Other organic dog food also make him itch miserably.  But on the Newman's Own he's stopped the itching and shedding, and he absolutely devours this stuff.  LOVE IT!!!!"
"Good, but costs more","Oregon Chai is the only concentrate my wife and I will buy, so this is not a critique of the product, but the cost of this particular package.<br /><br />You'd think buying the larger container, in a super concentrate (2 oz. per serving) would be lower in cost per serving. This half gallon of super concentrate costs 90¢ per serving, but the quart-sized package costs 71¢ per serving.<br /><br />So save your money, buy the 5-pack of quart packages."
K cup green tea,"Product was as described. The green tea flavor is okay, it can be a bit strong unless you prefer stronger flavors. I would purchase it again."
Fantastic!,"I absolutely love these Beaba Multiportion Freezer Trays!!! They are wonderful for children, grandchildren of several age levels. My daughter and I are using them for her 3 mo. old for home made food. We prepare food, portion out, and chill or freeze and needed. We can mix multiple items in one tray and it is ready for the babysitter to use.<br /><br />I love the soft bottoms because we can pop out the frozen portions we need. I love the close fitting top which keeps in freshness. I wish I'd had these when my girls were little<br /><br />We also use these as carry along snack trays for the 3 1/2 year old. She gets to choose and portion her snacks for the day. Wonderful!"
"The good, old-fashion taste.","What would life be without a big serving of ginger flavored cookies and cake? Normally I make gingerbread from scratch but this time I tried Betty Crocker's mix. It was great. The cookies came out of the oven and were cooling on the rack, the house smelled like a HOME and half of the cookies were gone before they had completely cooled. Now I must admit that I added some minced fresh ginger root to the mix. Also, I have added crystallized ginger on occasion and both have pepped up the intensity of the product. I am a ginger lover from way back. This is a good product and also a time saver. Worth a try if you have the craving for gingerbread or cookies."
Arrived Excellent Condition!,"I was a bit worried with so many reviews commenting about dented cans, but I received all 12 cans at my doorstep in perfect condition. The product is delicious and tastes fresher (less processed) than some competitor brands and I will definitely be buying again through amazon as long as the price remains similar."
A better place to purchase,My rating has nothing to do with the actual product but the purchase price.<br />This particular salt can be purchased on the celticseasalt website from 2 to 5 dollars per bag depending on the size bag. Do not purchase this anywhere else you are wasting your money.
Better than Gerber,I like that it is organic and doesn't taste bad.  I recommend this food because Gerber just doesn't cut it for me- I like Earth's Best' food combinations.
Better coffee from a can,"There's no denying the Senseo is easy to use, and 'greener' than any of the other pod brewers out there. But the Dark Roast coffee was stale and dry, with the same aroma and flavor of a canned coffee that's been left sitting out too long.<br /><br />A pod brew will never be AS GOOD as drip - I get that. But that won't stop me from looking for something close.<br /><br />If you want easy and are not picky about taste, this pod's for you. If you want a pod brew that is at all reminiscent of a decent cup of coffeehouse java, keep looking."
Favorite,"THis is probably my favorite Nuun flavor of all of them and I have tried most.<br />It is the perfect balance of flavor, not too strong."
No more upset stomach and better health for our papillon,"After switching from puppy to adult food our 8 lb. female papillon would often vomit at least once a day.  We were feeding her and our 13 lb. papillon Blue Buffalo food.  They both really liked it.  The larger papillon had no stomach issues with Blue Buffalo.  Our veterinarian suggested we give the small papi over-the-counter Pepcid (1/4 pill) a couple of times a day.  We tried that for a month and nothing changed so I did a lot of research online regarding dog food.  From that research I decided to try the Natural Balance L.I.D. sweet potato and fish small bites formula.  Voila!  No more stomach problems or any other issues.  Both papis are on this food now and the results have been wonderful.  The small papi gets small bites, while the large papi gets the regular sized bites.  They are each fed the recommended amount and they have maintained their optimal weight."
Great Coffee!,"This coffee is a little more Robust than the original...but has a great, smooth flavor.  We like the whole beans so we can gind it ourselves.  We love it and will continue to purchase this product."
The best chips EVER!,"PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down.  The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.  The calories and fat are very low.  No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip.  You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem.  But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case.  One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!"
amazing!,"i found the packets at walmart for 57 cents i believe, but when i went back a week later they didn't have anymore! i also checked cvs and walgreens and they didn't have it either. i was so happy i found it on amazon and in cans which i think is a better deal than packets because you get more product. this is definately the best hot chocolate i've ever had. the peppermint isn't over powering like most peppermint hot chocolates i've had. i'll definately be buying more when i run out!"
Price Shopping,"I've been drinking chocolate instant breakfast since high school. That was lot of years ago and I still love it. Since I drink a glass of this every morning. I recently moved and the local grocer doesn't carry it.  The town is small, so I shop on the Internet a lot. I buy a lot at Amazon too. However, two different price checks sent me to Amazon for this item. Both were advertised as the lowest but they were not. One of Amazon's listings was almost twice the price of a walmart store. Even Walgreen on line lists it for 4.99 per box of 10 packages."
I love the variety of tastes!,"I love the variety of tastes and textures Earth's Best offers. The gourmet meals selection was fabulous. My son devoured everything with a smile!! I do suggest getting the subscribe and save if your child is a big eater like mine. And as always, earth's best was the best!"
Bully sticks,"My dog loves bully sticks and we try to find good natural ones for her to chew on.  They are healthy and good for dog's teeth.  I am very pleased with the purchase, and my dog loves them.  No bad smell when she eats them.  Will definitely buy again!"
Sadness for Canadians!,"I love, love, love Island Pineapple Jell-o for certain important family recipes.  Unfortunately, Amazon can't ship it to Canada.  SADNESS!"
great product for older dogs with arthritis,"This product is great for older dogs with hip, joint, and or arthritis.  I ran out of these treats for a few days, and I really noticed the difference in my dog.  This product really does work."
BEST. SOUR. CANDIES. EVER.,"I first tasted these in Europe 14 years ago, and I'm still hooked. They're the perfect texture. I don't like gummy candies that are too soft or gelatin-like. In fact, I prefer to buy sour candies that are less ""fresh"" so they're harder and chewier. These are great fresh out of the bag.<br /><br />The flavours are strawberry, apple and pear. Usually when I eat a bag of mixed candies there's always one that isn't my favourite but I eat it anyway because it's included in the bag. All of these flavours are yummy, and I still (after 12 bags!) can't decide which I like best.<br /><br />Trust me, if you like sour gummy candies PLEASE try these. You won't be disappointed!!!"
taste okay but,Taste okay but the powder inside the plastic cups are clumpy. It dissolves okay but it just has the appearance that it may have gotten wet or is old.<br />Besides that everything else is fine.
Great buy,I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.  My friends even asked me to order more boxes and they are junk food nuts but didn't care that these are a healthy alternative.  They love them too!
I don't like it...,"I just don't like this. The scent is supposed to be subtle, but it's overpowering to me and neither manly nor pleasant. It seems to do a well enough job cleaning and rinsing off, but that can be said of just about any body wash product (or soap for that matter). I'm not really liking it for washing my face either (I use a different Dove product for that) as it really doesn't seem to get deep into the pores. My skin feels about the same. I'll finish this bottle, but this won't make me quit buying Old Spice...it does what it's supposed to do, but I can't get past the smell...it's just not for me."
best popcorn ever,"I love popcorn, and have it often. None of the micro wave popcorn i've tried comes close to the great northern popcorn. A short time ago we had friends over, I popped corn on the stove, and put real melted butter on it, ( you know the old fashioned way,) and used to be my favorite. I also popped up some great northern popcorn in my popper. Once the great northern was tried, it was gone in no time.. Thank you great northern for the best popcorn ever....<br />  ps, I will be ordering more soon<br />  carl p<br />  watertown ny"
Great Coffee!,"Fantastic Coffee, at a a fraction of the price of the freeze dried Keurig K-cup's, all of which are made by the same company, with the same tasteless coffee bean, no matter what the name of the coffee.  I can't imagine paying a dollar a cup for a ""donut house"" k-cup that is made of Folgers.  What a joke."
Very nice,Bought this as a gift for someone who really enjoys tea. She loved the gift- and said that the teas provided tasted very good. It was beautifully packaged- the box is gorgeous...the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought that it would be larger than it was. But it was still a nice gift.
Coffee Bean Direct Breakfast Blend,This was a good blend.  It made a decent cup of morning coffee.  I like the Sumatran and Brazilian Santos better.
One and Only,"I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I didn't really drink tea, until about six months ago. I was drinking <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HFA3XY"">Honest Tea Half Tea & Half Lemonade 12 pack 16.9 oz. plastic bottles</a>  - I quickly grew tired of the cost, and disposing of so many plastic bottles.<br /><br />Making the switch to tea bags, I picked this tea at random from the local grocery store, expecting it would be one of many brands and types I would need to try before finding a favorite.  After trying a few others, this is definitely the one!<br /><br />If anyone has information on the quality of ingredients, EGCG levels, etc., please reply to this review."
Cuious. . . and strong.,"I have never found Altoids to be lacking.  Also bought the new licorice flavor.  It is really nice if you like licorice, and I do.<br /><br />Good price."
"Like Salt & Vinegar Chips, but healthier!","If you love salt & vinegar chips like I do, these are for you.  Great salty snack, high in protein, pretty filling, and without the grease of potato chips. Definitely recommend!"
Great Bread,I tried a lot of gluten free bread before I found Pamelas.  It is the best and you can make it in your bread machine.  It is dense and moist and tastes great and you can add items to make different variations.
Slim Jim snack sticks,"After ordering this the first time, I decided to reorder. If you like Slim Jims, you will love these. They are a convenient size and mild. They make a great snack for in between meals. I highly recommend these!"
Triple Bergamot,"I like this tea. Whenever I pull a bag out of it's foil envelope, i like to inhale the scent of the Bergamot Oil.  Triple Bergamot ?  Bring it on !"
Tastes like medium roast espresso,"I like strong coffee - have a Keurig for my daily brews, and stop by Starbucks every couple of days.  So I thought I'd give this a try - I'm tired of the generic energy drink taste. This tastes like a medium roast Espresso, with the same after-taste. It has only 50 calories, although I'd prefer no calories. I did not pour over ice - drank from the can right out of the fridge. That's plenty cold, easier to carry, and I can keep a can in my pack when on the road.  You can also keep the can in the freezer for about a couple of hour before sticking in a backpack, so it will be ice cold several hours later.<br /><br />At 6.8 oz, the can is thicker than a Red Bull can (8.4 oz), and a tad bit shorter.  Definitely worth a try!"
Excellent Product,"I love this product.  I did not order it from Amazon (actually got it a Publix Supermarket, for those who live in the South).  But it is well worth it.  Each biscotti is individually wrapped in plastic, so they maintain their freshness even after opening the package."
Great tea for pregnancy,I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. It's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it. It helps strengthen the uterus. I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well.
Almond paste,"I found a recipe for almond paste cookies that I tried and my family really liked them. Buying Almond paste from the grocery store was expensive, so I looked on line and found the Solo brand on Amazon. I bought them and as soon as the 4 pack arrived I made another batch of cookies. My family liked them even better than the ones I made earlier and it wasn't as expensive. I then made Almond muffins, which turned out great. Good product, very good price."
Zebra Popcorn,"My whole family loves this popcorn.  It's highly addictive and not cheap so be prepared to spend a ton of money on this stuff 'cause once you taste it, you can't live without it.  Crunchy fresh popcorn covered with carmel and drizzled with white and dark chocolate - yum!  I highly recommend this product.  It's the most delicious thing I've ever tasted!"
The only bottled still water I drink...,"Some people debate about the high PH - one can Google to find the issues and discussion. I used to drink Trinity water but they went out of business. I found Essentia and found I like it better.<br /><br />I only drink bottled water -- Essentia is expensive so I use other spring water for making coffee and cooking. But I drink a minimum of four 8 oz glasses a day -- often six. (The recommendation of 8 glasses of water per day has now been found to be excessive. Four to six will do -- but it definitely makes a difference doing so -- my skin becomes smoother and clear within days, it helps when I work out.<br /><br />I now get it through Amazon through subscribe and save -- it is cheaper than in the stores (even in Whole Foods with a 10% case discount) and it is too much of a hassle to ensure the stores have it -- as they are quite inconsistent with their water ordering.<br /><br />The taste I find delicious and superb. My partner prefers Glaceaus' smart water. He drinks it at room temperature and it has a lower but still substantial Ph.<br /><br />In researching for this review I have learned about two other waters with high Ph's: Kagen and Qure. There are differences among all three and I haven't had the time to nail down the differences and which would be deemed more healthy. I probably will do that sometime in the future.<br /><br />But you can't go wrong with Essentia. Try some (chilled in the fridge) and see if you like it. Your body certainly will."
Good coffee bad seals,"Coffee rich and strong no problem. However about half broke open during the brewing process,getting grounds in my coffee and all over.  Obviously a defect in top cup seal packaging. Eventually I cut off the bottom of the cup and it relived the pressure so as to not blow seal."
Don't know how this one passed the taste test...,"Has a chemical flavor to it and it literally smells like vomit to me.  No resemblance of any con queso I've ever had!<br /><br />I love con queso salsa and have tried several variates.  Tostido's brand is pretty good, compared to this one.  I'd go with that!"
The Best,"I love this, and is not easy to find. Stores run out of them so quickly,; it's sooooooooooooo good, it gives such a pleasure when you eat it; touch down is the Best one, loooooooooooooooove it"
rip offs,"the add presents this item as having 48 items in it ,then it states you get only 36 pieces. This is cheating !!!!!!!!!!"
"Good, mild green","I am an avid tea drinker and so I was at a bit of a loss when I became pregnant.  I wanted to cut caffeinated tea out of my diet during the pregnancy but soon found that meant my choices were limited to herbals and a small handful of decaf black teas, which were mostly flavored.  One day I came across this one at the grocery store and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I've long enjoyed Stash teas for their quality, which is pretty incomparable.  I generally prefer loose teas to bagged but Stash is one of those rare teas whose flavor isn't compromised by the bag.  I found this to be the case with this particular tea.  It's not a very complex flavor, which is why I wouldn't give it a full five stars.  However, it is very mild and has a nice, subtle nutty flavor.  It's definitely a good tea for those who are new to greens as when it's brewed appropriately it has none of the bitterness or strong grassy flavor that can sometimes come through in greens.  It's an easy drinking tea and I sip it throughout the day, to the point where I drink around three oversized mugs of it a day.  In light of this, I now order it by the 6-pack from Amazon in order to have a continuous supply."
great service and product,Love this stuff!  The order came quickly and was packaged well.  Nutiva's products are always fresh and healthy and come in so many different sizes to please all appetites : )
On-Line Crystal Light purchase,"What I'd be buying in the store, should the store I shop at still be selling it.  Much more expensive, but worth it to me if I am able to still get it."
Sweet & Sour,"This stuff is the best! It's good on just about anything,chicken,pork,french fries and burgers. I wish they sold it in bottles too."
Pretty good for Indian food in a package.,"My husband and I are connoisseurs of Indian food and this is pretty good for ready to eat food in a package. Its nicely spiced, low in calories and sodium. I highly recommend this brand and the rajma in particular."
"The story is great, the softcover book is disappointing","I give five stars to the Maurice Sendak story. One star for this printed edition of the book.<br />My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy."
Don't eat these unless you want a new addiction,"I have been buying out the stock of these cookies at every Stop & Shop and King Kullen in my area for quite some time!! They put out 12 boxes-I buy 12 boxes-until they raised the price so much in 2 years that I sought out other methods of satisfying my addiction.<br />Amazon to the rescue!!! The subscription service is a wonderful thing-brings the price down to $2.11/box-when they are now $3.69 in my local supermarket-(if you can find them). And FREE SHIPPING!!  Finding this service was my refuge to keep these cookies in my life without going into ""cookie bankruptcy""-with  my food budget.  LOVE THEM!!"
OMG,"I randomly grabed this out of a bag of halloween candy, ate it, and fell in love. I love this pop im hoping that this product becomes available before my birthday. This is THE BEST out of all the flavors, but i cant find it every where"
Great finishing touch,"I use this sesame oil in some of my stir-fry, and it's fantastic. Just a few drops of this goes a long way in enhancing the aroma of the food. Too much can be overwhelming, coating all of the food with a strong sesame taste. Definitely recommended if you like stir-frying!"
"Tastes good, but.....","The reason I gave this only 2 stars is not because of the taste. It tastes great! I actually had this at a restaurant for the first time, which is what prompted me to find it online and buy it.<br /><br />But, almost every ingredient is artificial. Hardly anything about this product is something I would willingly put into my body on a regular basis. It's a powdery mix when you open it and pour one scoup into a cup of hot water. It makes you wonder where the tea actually is.<br /><br />I don't recommend this highly processed, chemically manufactured, mostly artificial ingredients, product to anyone. Unless you just don't care what you put into your bodies and just want it for the taste."
taste like homemade cookies,"My family and I loved those cookies.  In a matter of fact, I need to order some more.  They reminded me of spiced cookies I used to make for Xmas."
Love this tea!,"I have to admit I've never actually tried this tea just brewed in water. My best friend got me hooked on it by brewing it in half milk,half water, with a tad of sugar and pure vanilla extract. Unbelievable! You could keep it skinny by using skim milk and your favorite sweetener. It's like having a fancy Starbucks drink at a fraction of the cost and much lower in caffiene than coffee!"
Way Overpriced,Love Jif Peanut Butter and placed an order through Amazon for the 2 48oz jars for $19.00 then visited my local Walmart and found 2 40oz jars for $9.24.  I like the concept of buying through Amazon with no shipping and no tax.  But I got taken on this order.
English Breakfast tea,Celestial Seasons has one of my favorite K-Cup teas in English Breakfast tea.  I am a repeat customer in buying this brand of tea.
amazing,This seems to make my flowers bloom like crazy. I've been using it for a few years now. I love it.
Move over Balsamico,"This stuff is delicious and incredibly useful.  I've macerated berries in it (it's wonderful with strawberries); marinated pork with it; added it to sauces; as well as made salad dressings. In every dish, it was a star. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle."
Great for Obedience Training,"My dog loves these treats and they are easy to carry in your pocket to classes.  Great to use in teaching commands and obedience training.  The size is optimal for transport.<br /><br />Bentley/2007<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006U7SVI"">Real Meat Chicken & Venison Jerky Dog Treats (12-oz pouch - Chicken & Venison Jerky Treats)</a>"
Awesome,Love it! You can put it on anything really and the taste is great! I use it for my Roads End mac and chreese as well as salads and zuchinni tacos.
grocery,I like this grocery.<br /><br />It is too spicy and famous noodle in Korea.<br /><br />I'm not Korean but I can eat it.<br /><br />Customer service is so good because it is so speedy
Trash! Don't waste your meony,I just got these items. They were as hard as the leather. And I could not return these items. Don't waste your money. They are trash.
Bob's Red Mill Whey Protein Mix,I love the fact that this has nothing in it other than the Whey protein<br />I can add whatever I want and not worry about having allergic reactions.<br />just love it.<br />Thank you
delicious -- good thing the bags aren't any bigger,"Just the right amount of spice and tangy bleu cheese flavor, plus a lovely crinkle-cut crunch.  I'm just grateful that the bags aren't any larger, since I find it impossible to stop eating these until I've finished the entire 2-oz. bag.<br /><br />So far, I've bought both these Buffalo Bleu and the Salt and Vinegar flavors, and they're both excellent quality chips."
Tastes great,Works great in my iced tea brewing machine that I use in my concession trailer. Tastes great! Customers cannot believe that we use Lipton tea & not some cheap off brand like almost every concession stand uses. We only serve our customers the best!!
"Coffee great, seller not so great.","We drink Green Mountain coffee all the time, and it is one of the few suppliers that provide it in Half-Caf. I am a decafinated coffee drinker most of the time but my wife likes a little kick to start her morning and the Half-Caf does the trick, and Green Mountain's Half-Caf has a very good taste without the decalf after taste. We also buy other flavors provided by Green Mountain and they all have a great coffee taste."
Delicious but can do without the sugar rush,Delicious like the regular snack Treats but a sugar rush  is the last thing I need early in the morning. As a snack by hand out of the box at other times fine.
mmmmm!,"I've had these at Starbucks, and saw on myList that you can buy them here! Really delicious and filling, and not dry like other granola or health bars."
Great Product Price and Service,"Product was shipped promptly and arrived in good condition. Often such products are old and rancid but NOT in this case. Discount for automatic shipping. Roasted edamame are are high in protein and fiber, much lower in fat than most nuts, low in calories and only 2 grams of net carbs per serving."
My Spoiled Rotties Love It,"I use pedigree products and I am quiet satisfied with them.  I have used other products Diamond Naturals and Halo etc...  Which are good as well, but more expensive.  I have very strong dogs and they both enjoy pedigree dry and the meat varieties."
Best Bloody Mary mixer,"I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other.  Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup.  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. It does have a little kick. Enjoy."
Great flavored tea,"This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online."
Great Tasting Dressing,I have been eating Pfeiffer Caesar dressing for over 40 years. It is my favorite salad dressing. I now live in an area where the local supermarkets do not carry it. I was delighted to find it on Amazon.
Even a snack a meat eater would like,"I am not by any means a vegetarian (I eat my steaks rare), but I do try to eat healthy.  Beef jerky is a great snack if you are on the go (I travel a lot), but the constant intake of red meat is not good for you.  So, I tried the Primal Strip vegan strips.  I have had every one that they make.....and they are all good.  The Thai Satian Peanut is by far my favorite (the hot and spicy shiitake mushroom jerky is my second favorite).  I have recommended this snack to even the most devout meat eaters and they even like it.  I give it 5 stars - but just like everything - they are not for everyone.  I recommend buying them individually first, and if you love it then come back to amazon and get a box (amazon is the cheapest for the boxes)."
A Very Quality Beverage.,"I enjoy a variety of beverages with my meals, and just for refreshment. I've tried any number of bottled teas and I like some of them. Personally, I've always thought that most were either too sweet (whether with honey, sugar or artificially flavored). I was mentioning this to my wife the other day and she came up with a packet of Ito En (Oi Ocha) Japanese Green Tea and suggested I try it. She said it came from Costco, but it's probably available elsewhere or here on Amazon. Well, I took a bottle (16.9 ounces) pored over ice and a later bottle chilled ice cold in the fridge. Excellent. Much better than other brands. Very smooth and light tasting with a ever-so slightly bitter aftertaste. Quite refreshing! Goes well with food. I particularly like the absence of any sweetness of any kind. Plus it has the antioxident qualities of green tea and a surprisingly high vitamin C content. It's a very quality beverage.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
Tastes good!,"I like this water, in part because the ph is 8.5 which is supposed to be better for you. In addition, it tastes good, and I often won't drink enough water because I don't like the way other sources of water taste. However, the price noted here ($66.00+) for 12 1.5 liter bottles is ABSOLUTELY INSANE! I just got home from Mother's Market where one bottle is $1.39! Whole Foods also carries it for $1.69/bottle. Save your money, or, if you have money to burn, do something productive with it, donate to an animal shelter or something and buy your water elsewhere!"
Mrs. May's Bars,"LOVE these bars! They are a great snack, and very tasty. All three flavors are very good, but I prefer the Goji Cranberry!"
Great Northern Popcorn,We just love this popcorn. It's just like being at the theater -- only better. Doesn't have that fake butter flavor that our theater has.
Fo Shizzle,"I have made Iced Chai Lattes with this mix for about five people now and they all LOVE it.  There are instructions on the side of the container that tell you how to do it.  It's very simple.  My only suggestions is this:  When it says to use 1 and 1/3 cups of powder, only use 1 cup.  It can be too sweet if you use the amounts they tell you to use."
This Coffee is Our Favorite,"First, Mocha Java isn't Mocha...No chocolate here.  This is a well rounded, easy drinking cup of coffee."
Best coconut water I've had outside of Asia. Price on AMZN is too much. Whole Foods has it for less than 20 bucks a case.,Best coconut water I've had outside of Asia. Price on AMZN is too much. Whole Foods has it for less than 20 bucks a case.
My Pomeranians LOVE these!,Fabulous product line!  No odors!  No stains!  I have two male 8 pound Pomeranians and they love these as a treat at night when my husband and I are watching a movie.  It is great to not worry about them staining the bedding or furniture.
those prunes are nutritious and delicious,"I have eaten several bags of those prunes and they are soft, juicy and only encountered few of the prunes with broken hard shell in it which never bothered me. Every morning I would eat 10 to a dozen of them with my steamed oatmeal.  They are so yummy and I do not need to add any sugar into my oatmeal bowl."
Great Coffee!,"Had this coffee years ago in Louisiana, and it was the smoothest tasting coffee I had ever had.<br />Came across it on Amazon, and ordered it.  The delivery was extremely quick, and came within 2 days of placing the order.  The Taste of the coffee is still the same as the last time I had it.  GREAT COFFEE and GREAT SERVICE!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y2QTNO"">Community Coffee Ground Coffee, Dark Roast, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>"
Terrible merchant. Not what was ordered.,"Before purchasing anything from Lous bonsai, check out the reviews on the Internet, not the ones he writes but the legitimate ones. They're horrible. He promises one thing and delivers another, then offers to replace it, either never does or, as he did in our case, sends one as bad as the first. Terrible merchant. I wouldn't buy dog food from this guy."
Excellnt sauce,"I just love this italian sauce.  Stores where I live no longer carry this product (boo hoo). Dei Fratelli charges more for shipping the product than the product itself.  Quite ridiculous!!  Does any one know where to find this in a store in Massachusetts or, bordering MA?  Please comment.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CT3I2W"">Dei Fratelli Italian Sauce case pack 12</a>"
Good Product,This product seems a little weaker than competative products but if you are using a lot of you can double the amount and still be far ahead of supermarket prices.
Love it,"This is some of the finest quality coffee I've ever tried, great taste and aroma.  Go get a free sample from their website and try it for yourself.  I'm getting more."
"Good, but strong toasted coconut flavor","This are very good. I was a little surprised by how strong the toasted coconut flavor was since it isn't included in the ""flavor"" of the bar. I would buy them again. My wife wouldn't eat them though because of the coconut."
Not what I purchased,I received a completely different product than I ordered. The product is similar but is a different brand and does not taste good. I would like the product I bought  please.
Great stuff!,This is a tangy tomato-based sauce containing lemon and cilantro flavors.  It's good by itself or with chicken or pork.  I then serve it over basmati rice.  Quick and yummy.
Teatulie tea with neem,"This tea is interesting.  My friend says neem taste takes some getting used to but it is good for your teeth.  Well this tasted good, must be because its mixed with black tea.  I'd give it a try if I were you!"
Excellent,"Ordered for a friend.  The Friend in question is not a tea drinker but he does oddly enough love a good cup of Oolong tea every now and again.  He raves about how great this Tea is, not one to drink tea myself, but I'm glad he enjoys it."
"Strong but flat, lacking definition","These k-cups are certainly bold and strong, but the finish is flat and thin.  It's lacking in overtones after the inital dark wave.  I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week.  Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are.  I wanted something dark and rich in texture.  But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish."
$70!,"It may not be fair for me to review this.  I sent it out to Uncle Johnny just yesterday.  But when I think about it, that box of dried fruit and nuts can't be all that big, and certainly not worth $70.  But somehow that's what my total came out to by the time I was at the end.  I think it was the shipping that did it.  I love my uncle Johnny, but that really hurt.  I found something that looked nice and was in my price range and then once I click ""submit"" I got a total of $69.+!!!  I was LIVID!  And I can't help but muttering to myself over and over now- if I'm going to give out $70 to someone as a gift, I certainly want them to get $70 worth of something.  So, I guess in the long run, it's not the product I'm reviewing, it's the shipping scam.<br />And these businesses who started with a wonderful idea, have turned our sympathies to just that- A SCAM.  I can not longer support them.  I'm out.  There are other ways I can say I love you, or I'm sorry your wife died."
Incredibly tasty and convenient.,"Amazing.  I used to make my own pasta sauce from fresh tomatoes constantly, and I hate to admit to being lazy, but this stuff is so good that it makes it unnecessary to go to the trouble.  The company is also very nice.  They have several other incredible flavors, but Amazon is unfortunately unreliable about offering them consistently.  I probably order about four boxes of their sauces per month, including this flavor.  They are quite good for use as sauce bases, even though they are very tasty on their own - ""eat right of the jar"" tasty.  If you start eating out of the jar, be careful because you may not be able to stop yourself.<br /><br />The little jars the sauces come packed in are very useful for storage - I bring my lunch to work in them, as they are exactly the right size for a healthy meal.<br /><br />Warning - some people have reported receiving broken jars when ordering these and having them shipped via ground.  I have Amazon Prime, so they come two-day, and the box is always in flawless condition."
THE BEST GUACAMOLE EVER!,"You'll have a hard time convincing anyone that you didn't  make this delicious, can't-stop-eating-it Guacamole all from scratch.  The taste is fresher than fresh.<br /><br />  The mix is lightly flavored with  tomatillo, garlic and cilantro - just enough for a bit of spice but not so hot that you have to follow each  bite with a drink of something.<br /><br />  So easy  to prepare - simply  mash ripe avocado and add  mix.  We  like  to have a bit of the avocado in the Guacamole so we use a ricer for mashing.<br /><br />  We  prepared enough for 12 the other night and four of us made quick work of it.  Highly recommend!"
best to digest,"If you are concerned about digesting dairy and soy products you can rest assured that this is the protein for you. It's a nice vanilla flavor with no chalkiness and no artificial sweeteners. I love it and I know my body loves it. NO digestion problems, ever. Rock on."
Meh..I've had better,"I have drank Bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it.  But, by current supermarket doesn't carry Bigelow's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is ""Peppermint"".  I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting.  I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor.  Also, there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas.  Bigelow's brand has a slightly sweeter taste, which I enjoy.  In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea."
Just enough crunch!,"Unlike one uphappy reviewer, I was pleased to open my jar of Branston Original and discover that it was just as crunchy and just as flavorful as the last time I'd had a Ploughman's in a pub in the UK.  I'd never had anything like it here in the US and was delighted with it on first acquaintance.  It's a pungent explosion for the tastebuds and a nice crunch for the choppers, too.  I will admit there is a bit more of the sauce-y stuff, in proportion to the crunch, than I like -- hence the four stars instead of five -- but on all other points, this pickle in a jar compares very favorably to what I recall having fresh.  I've also ordered the Heinz Ploughman's pickle through Amazon --  not so much crunchy stuff, way too much ""sauce,"" and not as good a flavor (blander) IMO.  This Crosse and Blackwell comes in a good sized jar for the price and is well worth ordering."
love it,"lots of coconut flavor and only a few grams of carbs.  make a lot more sense than paying $2.50 per bottle at the gym.  jen aniston is never wrong, right?"
"Misleading, Lacking Info in Description Field","I need pure light malt extract...  In powder form.  No where in the description does it state this is liquid!...  Now I will be set back yet another couple weeks AND a few wasted dollars short...  I take full responsibility for my ignorance; but in this case, I can only go by the information provided...<br />Thomas Coopers needs to be much more thorough with their product descriptions."
Healthy Dog at Last,"My puppy had a severe diarrhea for weeks until we put her on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato.  Just like a miracle, she is healthy and energetic."
"Poisonous, contributed to depression","[...]<br />Sucralose, the sweetener in Splenda, is poisonous. It contributed greatly to my depression, and contrary to popular belief, can actually keep weight on those who consume it, rather than helping them lose it.<br /><br />This is true for the vast majority of artificial sweeteners."
Hall's Plus Icy Lemon,It was very disappointing when these were received as the product was NOT as described. It clearly stated 3.5000 pounds of cough drops but after delivery it consisted of the same 12 bags.<br /><br />The net result was a higher price for the same amount of cough drops.
Best overall Pod coffee,"I have a Gevalia pod coffee maker with 6, 8 and 12oz. cup choices. Most of the pods I try need two pods for any size larger than 6oz. This makes a robust but not better 12 oz cup. And to boot it's cheaper than the other pod coffee brands. The senseo pods  are useless if you want a man sized mug. At the price of most pod coffees {$12.99 to $19.99) using two pods per cup is not cost efficient. I only wish Marley Coffee had more blends to choose from."
"BPA free cans, delicious coconut milk","Bought this product at Whole Foods. It is excellent. Sorry to hear about the problems ordering through Amazon, but if you can buy it at Whole Foods or another health food/gourmet grocer, it's great stuff."
Very happy,"So far we prepared banana, yam, and buternut squash; had no problems steaming foods or blending them; although yam took a bit longer to get softer. I searched different baby food makers and some time ago I stumbled on a site that reviewed different blenders/mixers, most of them were not marketed as baby food makers however review included if the blenders were baby safe. However, there are only few products that combine steamer and blender. I haven't tried any other ones, but I'm 100% happy with this one."
Strong Delicious Coffee - Fantastic Price,"Love ordering from Amazon - with affordable shipping, you get great products at a reasonable price delivered FAST.<br />We love a bold flavorful coffee, this is it!  Not too much acid, no bitterness. Just delicious, rich coffee."
Another winner from Crystal Light,"I drink a lot of Crystal Light.  I'm a big fan of the wide variety of flavors, the insanely low calorie count and the lack of sugar and sodium.  The Margarita flavor has 30 mg of sodium per serving, most of the other flavors I've tried have zero).  They're a refreshing way to quench your thirst without feeling guilty.  I like the convenience too.  Each envelope (there are 5 per container) makes 2 quarts.  I mix it up in a large pitcher and refrigerate so it's ready when I want a cold drink.<br /><br />The Margarita flavor is delicious and tastes quite authentic, right down to the slightly salty tang.  While I enjoy it on its own and frequently drink it that way, sometimes I like to kick it up a notch and add tequila to my drink.  For all the ease of preparation, it makes a surprisingly good Margarita.  I'm adding this one to my favorites list."
Absolutely delicious--- and potentially very dangerous too,"I was enjoying some of this yummy licorice just now while at the computer, my first experience with RJ's. I became curious about the medicinal applications of licorice and searched ""licorice health"". I was stunned to find that licorice root and extract are implicated in a number of potentially serious health problems: hypertension, potassium depletion, heart and kidney failure,  fluid retention and swelling of the face and limbs, hormonal imbalance, and muscle destruction leading to pain and weakness. Licorice can reduce thyroid gland activity and lower basal metabolic rate. Pregnant women should avoid licorice because of danger to the fetus. From the ""People's Pharmacy"" web site:<br /><br />""It appears that individuals vary considerably in their susceptibility to adverse reactions from licorice. Some people experience negative symptoms within days, while others may ingest excessive licorice in candy, chewing gum, chewing tobacco, or herbal medicine for months or even years before they realize that they are suffering damaging effects. Women appear to be somewhat more susceptible than men, and oral contraceptives may increase this sensitivity.<br /><br />Paralysis of the legs (and in one case, of all of the limbs) has been reported. A sixty-four-year-old man developed pulmonary edema, signaled by fatigue and trouble breathing, after eating four packages of black Twizzlers licorice candy in three days. This case demonstrates how quickly a serious reaction can arise.""<br /><br />Interestingly, most licorice candy sold in the US is made with anise, not licorice flavoring. RJ's however is made from licorice extract... tasty but not worth the risk to me personally as one with a family history of circulatory disorders. Be aware."
very good quality,"I use it to make soy milk every morning, it tastes wonderful. Much better than the one I bought from Chinese supermarket."
Great Tasting,Purchased this water at first due to the fact I needed the water bottle to fit into a drink holder/case.  It was a win win situation because it tasted great too!
Yummy Hawaiian Punch Smell; Light Hawaiian Punch Taste.  Or add more for stronger flavor.,"I liked this.  Depending on price, I would buy it again.  It smells great---just like the Hawaiian punch I had so often as a child.  A little hard to assess how much a serving is (one squeeze?), so I just experimented for the  amount of flavor I wanted.  A smidge...or more.  Depending on my mood.  Flexible flavoring. If you (as I often might) just want a smidge of flavor (akin to the level of a lemon in your water) this will last much longer than the 24 servings that are predicted on the label.  Although it's less portable (bc of it's size, it's more than I personally want to carry in a purse) I like this better than the Crystal Light type water flavorings.  Loved the smell!  :)  Enjoy!"
An outstanding decaf tea,"I have to drink decaf tea in the evenings and before I found this Typhoo I always had to trade off decent tasting tea for being able to sleep at night. But Typhoo decaf makes a very robust and flavorful pot of tea. On more than one occasion, somebody in the family has grabbed this decaf by mistake and nobody even realized it was decaf until we noticed the distinctive round bag in the bottom of the pot. This tea is best brewed by the pot using fully boiling water. If you try to make it by the individual cup using 190 degree water or water heated in a microwave, you'll probably be disappointed. Besides compromising the flavor, brewing by the cup would be wasteful since a single bag makes a good three cups of tea. The only compromise needed when brewing this decaf over regular black tea is the decaf needs to steep a bit longer (I'd say ten minutes) for maximum flavor. Alternatively, you can limit the water to two cups and then it's ready in about six minutes. Typhoo also makes regular caffeinated black tea which I consider to be just average."
The best hot sauce ever,"This is an amazing hot sauce. It tastes great on just about everything, and it's spicy. I bought 2 28 oz. bottles, and I plan to buy more."
Nutricious Crunch,I am enjoying the 1st package of the granola.  I like to mix it with non-fat yogurt with a little honey. The granola stays crunchy.  Glad I have 2 more boxes of this cereal. Will order again.
Hooray for Maypo!,Maypo tastes even better than it did in 1955!  Throw some raisins in before microwaving and it's like dessert for breakfast!  I bought a case at Christmas and made each box a stocking stuffer for the various branches of the family.  It brought a lot of laughs and later thanks for a a great alternative to standard oatmeal.  The sugar content is minimal when compared to the pleasures of a taste flashback.<br /><br />Eat hearty and remember Marky Maypo!
"Love it, only one downside....","I love my lighted tree.  It is beautiful and I've gotten tons of compliments on it.  My only wish is that it had a switch to turn it on.  Having to plug it in (in the particular location I have it) is inconvenient.  Other than that, I absolutely love it.  In fact, I ordered the red one after I had already bought the white one."
Great food,"I switched to this from wellness since it is a bit cheaper.  The wellness was a little more moist out of the package and kept my cats full with slightly smaller servings.  This may be due to the lack of filler and more protein in the blue buffalo wilderness.  I'm guessing the bag sitting in amazon's warehouse probably isn't quite as fresh as the one in a high volume pet store, thus this was just a little more dry.  Mixed with water or cod liver oil this is wonderful in treating my cat's dandruff."
Great Packaging and looks just like the Picture!,Bonsai Boy is a great store to order from! I ordered this juniper for my first bonsai and it came by the end of the week and was very well packaged. There was no sign of damage to the tree and it is doing great!
"Limited use, but it might be right for you.","Feral cats are the scourge of my inner city neighborhood.  They keep out down rats, but they have been using my carport as a Kitty Country Club.  They howl and fight all night.  They seem to love playing with my motion detector lights.  They get shade from the hot summer sun.  And  they spray their markers like a drunken poker game.  I can use the Havahart trap, but what to do when caught?  I can take them to the edge of town for coyote snacks.  I cannot just kill them, but the noise and using my yard as a litter box is getting to me.<br /><br />Havahart has a couple of other remedies.  This gritty mixture is one that I am trying.  Three weeks and not a peep.  I have not seen one in my carport.  But I cannot give a blanket endorsement:<br /><br />- It lasts only a month under ideal conditions.  I have not had any rain, but that might shorten the life considerably.  It is too expensive to buy 12 times a year.  And while only irritatingly toxic, I am not one who believes in laying down sixty pounds of chemical a year.  So it better make a lasting impression in just a month, which makes sense.  Negative reinforcement is powerful.<br />- It works by repellant odor.  So while a dry climate may mean it will not just soak into the ground, dryness also dampens odors.  But it is working.  They do not like sleeping around it.<br /><br />It covers 500 square feet, which is just right for me; the Amazon description says only 200.  So if I do not get new cats, or the old ones do not return for six months, that would be acceptable, but only time will tell."
Best Deal around,"I love using subscribe and save for all of our Torani Syrups. They taste great, I use the Ghirardelli Chocolate sauce and Gene Hicks Big Fat Espresso Bean with my Jura Z5 Espresso Machine. The combination makes a great Espresso and the price on Amazon can't be beat anywhere I look."
My favority tasty bite.,It looks very good.  Potatoes and some beans.  Delicious sauce.  I put over a chicken cutlet for dinner last night.  It was great.
JUST SAY NO,"Boy, did this sound like a great product.  We have a problem with roaches in our apartment and we wanted to give this a shot and avoid combat.  Bought a pack and were amazed at how quickly they were filled.  We had no idea we had so many roaches!<br />So after 3 mos or whatever, we were still having roach problems, so we bought more.  We were interested in how many roaches seemed to be HATCHING in the traps.  Gross, right?  We never had so many roaches.<br />So guess what.  We threw the traps away.  And away went the roaches.<br />We've checked everywhere, and they just seem to be gone.<br />The pheromones were ATTRACTING roaches to my apartment.  We had roaches, yes, but not the infestation we ended up with after using these things!  They seriously are a roach magnet, roaches will come from everywhere to get near them, hatch more babies in your home/apartment, and then you'll need to buy more roach magnets!  Amazing.<br />And gross.<br />Just don't do it.  This is a waste of money and will make your house unsafe with roaches, roach poop, you name it.<br />Totally gross."
"A tasty, kosher, healthier alternative to Pop Tarts","First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy."
5 stars from me,"My cats really like this food and they're picky little buggers. I like the fact that it's grain free and the 1st ingredients aren't by products. Ever since the gluten scare I've been pretty diligent about reading ingredients. I buy this from my local pet food store but will be ordering from Amazon next time as it's about 1/2 the price here...as long as I don't have to pay too much for shipping, that is."
Love Em',"My local gas station stopped selling these so I bought a case online. They are extremely tasty, and a good sour fix."
Similar to Starbucks,"This is excellent coffee and apparently the family of the late reggae star Bob Marley have something to do with it's production and/or marketing. It is a stronger blend coffee and someone with more acute taste buds than mine might argue, but I thought it tasted identical to Starbucks House Blend. This is a fair trade coffee so you are helping out the locals here more than the corporations. These are pods so you might want to have a machine that brews pods before you order, unlike me."
smooth and creamy,"previously tried the 5# french roast from this company and while it was good coffee and a good deal this italian roast was exceptional. i'm not overly obsessive or fanatically cultish about coffee(i don't like starbuck$ if that's any gauge-preferred coffee connection in MA from back in the day). i require something dark, not bitter, and strong to use in a french press or to make espresso with. this italian roast was chocolatey and very smooth with no bitterness whatsoever. it makes fabulous cappuccinos that seem nicely sweet with just the foamed milk. the beans were dark and oily-they were not stale. shipped quick, adequate and not overdone packaging.<br /><br />i've been poking around for a versatile daily drinker for sometime and believe this is it. very satisfying,quite delicious."
so easy my husband can do it,"The reason I am giving this pizza kit a 5 star is my husband made it all on his own, it was fast and the sauce is amazing.  He does not cook at all and has actually burned a pot making pasta once.  I am gluten intolerant so, sadly, can't eat the crust.  Now, rumor has it this company has a gluten free version coming soon.  I can't wait!!!"
Yum!,This is one of our daughter's favorite flavors. She devours it. I love the Subscribe & Save option so I don't have to think about re-ordering it. 5 Stars!
The only thing that worked,"I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat."
"Bold, but Acidic and bitter!  Where o' where is my Verona?","Purchased 3, 24-count boxes of Dark Magic based on the reviews; in my search for a palatable replacement for Starbucks Verona.  ....Yuck!<br /><br />Quick background... bought a Tassimo a year ago in hopes of discovering that near-perfect cup of coffee.  Soon after the purchase, finding that Perfection in ""Starbucks Verona"".  Wonderfully Bold and Strong, but oh-so-smooth!<br /><br />Three months ago, I bought a 3-month supply of Starbucks Verona (not cheap), and then a week ago... to my dismay!!!  I find that Tassimo (Kraft) and Starbucks have parted ways... like a couple of Hot-Tempered, Irresponsible Children... with absolutely no regard to their Loyal Customers... dissolve their relationship and quit shipping the ""Starbucks Verona"" ...... AAAAAAARRRRRGGGHHH !!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Back to this Dark Magic crap.... Strong... but very acidic, bitter and this very unfavorable ""flavor' sticks with you in the form of a lingering aftertaste!<br /><br />Those of you who thought that this was actually a ""good coffee""... you really need to... well, find some good coffee to make a comparison!<br /><br />I mean... who samples and then actually approves this stuff for production????  It's Nasty !!!!"
Gourmet pasta,"This is the same pasta which sells for considerably more at Whole Foods, Smiths and some Albertson's. This tastes like the pasta you would be served in an upscale Italian restaurant. Since it is made from spinach (but sure doesn't test like an spinach I've had)it is very healthy and simple to make. Add your favorite sauce, or some fresh tomatoes, and a glass of wine and you will be sitting down to a very nice meal with a minimum of effort. For a change try adding some chicken, soy , meatballs or fresh vegetables."
Let them eat lobster,"Hmm, my outdoor pond goldfish like it, as well they should as this comes out to $36/lb, more than lobster.<br /><br />So, what to do? Buy and grind up fish and wheat germ and whatever else is on the label?  Nothing motivates my fish like mosquito larvae, but living amongst those evil bloodsuckers is more than I want to do.<br /><br />Oh, well, I'll just get whatever seems to be the best deal at the time and maybe the herons and egrets and racoons  will live a better life near the top of the food chain. They seem to like fish that have been fed expensive food."
Scalp is less itchy,I have been using this along with the matching conditioner and it works pretty well. I tend to use coconut oil on my hair in the summer to protect it from heat and pool water and this shampoo washes it out with no problems. I have long thick hair which is dark but I have a few grays. I noticed my gray hairs which are usually course are a little bit smoother now. The shampoo has a nice scent that is not too strong. It is quite thick and lathers nicely.
"Too High On Carbs, Low On Protein","I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.<br /><br />My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine."
Wellness Chicken Stew,"The ratings for this food are among the highest and my Labrador LOVES this stuff!  I feel very good giving him this high quality food and am glad that my picky eater wants something that is so good for him.  It's chunky and you can see peas, carrots, potato, and, of course, the chunks of meat.  I highly recommend this product!"
for the shortbread  & lemon/lime lovers,"Shortbreads are some of my favorite cookies.  I also love lemon meringue and key lime pies.  This flavor cookie is a good marriage of the flavors without too much tart to the cookie.<br /><br />This cookie is crisper about the edges (first bite) than in the center where the texture is more of a true shortbread type.  I did not find dissatisfaction with the crisper edges.  I quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />The cookies seemed to me more lemon than a true key lime flavorng - but were still excellent for that.<br /><br />People who enjoy a good shortbread will like these and those liking lemon /lime will be pleasantly surprised at the way this combo meshes flavorwise.  I was hesitant to try at first - but will definitely get again.<br /><br />I got mine at a local shop and they were less costly (by a dollar per box) than the ones offered on Amazon, but, I don't find the cost here too terrible and they are not easy to find around here.  I would definitely look for them here if supply runs out nearby.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Christine"
Yum!,"I was surprised how large the tub actually was. The coconut oil is in a crisco consistency, but when I bake something with it, I just smear it on the pan, and when I fry something with it, I just drop it in the pan like I would butter. It smells incredible! After cooking with it, I could smell it on me for a few hours after and loved it. I use lots of it when I make coconut chicken, shrimp, etc. I use it to sautee my vegetables too. The coconut taste is not overwhelming, so substituting this healthy option for your regular cooking oil will not ""ruin"" your dishes or significantly change the taste of your food. I will purchase again."
Charms Fluffy Stuff Cotton Candy Lollipops,"There was nothing ""fluffy"" about these cotton candy lollipops. The flavor was good but if you expected something more like mini cotton candy you will be very disappointed."
great baby food,"This is a good choice for organic prunes for baby.  I make most of my baby's food but buy her prunes for the additional fiber and it's easier than making them.  These are a decent value for the price normally, but really good in this case option.  Normally at stores it's the 2 tub pack for $1 and change.  This case has 8 of the packs, making it a total of 16 tubs.  It's a lot of prunes but she eats them often and loves them."
"Too much ginger, weird aftertaste","Normally, I love ginger, honey and lemon in drinks.  Unfortunately, I found the ginger in this drink overpowered the taste of the lemon and honey.  I also felt like it was not a true ginger flavor, seemed somewhat artificial, which is probably where the odd aftertaste came from.  Can't quite explain the aftertaste, but it did seem almost chemical.  Not a drink I would purchase."
Great Flavor,I love all the HappyBaby Tot pouches.  My 3 year old eats them as a snack on the go.  This one is great frozen (let thaw for a bit to soften).  It is like a smoothie!
Affordable Organic Dog Treats,"This product is a win/win/win!  A healthy snack for my dog at an affordable price, and the proceeds go to charity.  Outside of the many moral reasons to buy these treats, my dog also loves them.  He rarely likes dry treats, but these are an exception.<br /><br />The treats are heart shaped and about the size of a quarter.  A couple of them are perfect for a small dog and one bag will last for several weeks.  It's really a great value."
Expired product shipped,"I have no issue with the product but a few days after opening it, I see it expired mid June.  These products typically have a long shelf life, so sending out expired product is inexcusable.  This is one product I won't buy from Amazon again."
Twinings Prince of Wales Tea,"I am a tea lover, and this product is exceptional.  This particular tea is hard to find in my local stores, but it's so good that I don't mind paying extra for shipping."
Just takes a few drops to cover the taste of non-filtered water.,"We have a water filter at home and I usually take a bottle of filtered water to work - but when that's gone, there is only tap water, so I keep this at work.  It just takes a squirt per bottle and the strong mineral flavor to our water is tolerable. No artificial sweeteners (which I do use rather than sugars, but try to keep to a minimum), very convenient.  This is a vine product so I didn't pay for it but I will definitely buy more when this is  gone.<br />I've tried several options and the only thing that I like better is a squeeze of fresh lime which is NOT convenient to keep in a drawer at work."
Love This Tea!!,"I purchased this tea on a whim... it just sounded so delicious.  And it is!  It is definitely one of the best teas that I've ever had, and it is the best flavor that I have had from Republic of Tea OTHER than their Blackberry Sage (which is OUTTA THIS WORLD!)<br /><br />But I do have to agree with the other reviewer that stated that there isn't much of a ginger taste.  For me, that was okay because I was unsure if I would like gingered tea.  Perhaps it would be better with a more gingered taste... I don't know."
"PUP LOVE = 5 star, -1 for the odor","My 10 months old labradoodle pup loves these.  She is normally carefree when someone approaches while she's eating her treats, but she'd growl when she's got these in her paws.<br /><br />The price is right, as the same size bag will cost at least 50% more at a local pet store.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is because of the odor.  I saw some other reviewers wrote about this, but the odor (especially while your dog is gnawing at it) is VERY strong.  The solution I came up with this is to give them to my dog when we leave her in her crate.<br /><br />Over all, this is a good product."
breeders recommendation,"this product was recommended by the breeder...our scottie loves it and looks forward to his meal...would definitely recommend this product to those with new puppies, even tho it is a little expensive, it does have all the nutrients required for good health..."
"Bold for Green Mountain, but not BOLD","If you are looking for a BOLD k-cup, try the Coffee People ""black tiger"" or their ""french roast"" bold... they are about the closest thing to a cup of Starbucks that you can get in a k-cup.  This is fine if you like Green Mountain, McDonalds, or Dunkin' Doughnuts coffee.  It has a classic GM slight nutty/sweet taste that I am not overly fond of but it is okay for an evening cup or when you are in the mood for something lighter."
Cats go veg,"Two months ago my two cats ages 6 and 15 went from a flesh diet (tuna, chicken, salmon and salad with nutritional yeast) to a lacto-vegetarian diet with Evolution moist and dry food and they have never looked back. I do have to combine this moist food with Seven Stars plain yogurt and then they eat it all enthusiastically. I also add some veggies to the mix. They have stopped their constant nagging me for food and seem much more content. My 15 year old boy was very thin and now he has filled out handsomely. The coats of both cats have become very silky and soft."
deez nutz.,great deal on these nuts. whole family loves these nuts. nuts for nuts. arrived fresh and tasty. great for a snack or packed in a lunch.
waste of money,The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.
Doggies love 'em,"Since I have been seeing so many recalls not only on dog food but treats, I decided to look for something that is made in this country and found these.  My two Pom's love them and it is their morning treat.  They won't let forget to give them to them as they make sure they stare me down till I do. lol  They can be eaten without any worry of anything happening to them as they don't contain plastic or any other foreign material. Unless I find a bad review or hear that there is a recall on these, hope there isn't, I will continue to buy these Edibles.  My boys like the bacon flavor the best out of all the different flavors offered.  Amazon also offers a really good price on these."
Greenies,My dogs love the greenies and their breath is alway good smelling. A good product.<br />I purchased this through Amazon for a better prlice than I normally get.  This is an expensive little treat but worth it.
warning! cancer...,"I love this stuff, but sadly just received a phone call from my mother who was watching Taiwanese news -- they recently were warning consumers in Asia NOT to buy Shin Ramyun (this brand specifically!) because of the increased risks of cancer...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />See this older study.  But it seems to have recently resurfaced and isn't in the mainstream US media..."
Poor Popping Corn,"This popcorn package is a great idea.  It has MANY flaws.  It is very difficult to pour the oil into the popcorn popper.  It is best when you heat the oil for  3-5 minutes and then add the popcorn and seasoning.,  The popcorn does not pop completely.  There are lots of left over kernels that never pop.  I am very disappointed in this product.  I will not purchase this product again."
Much Cheaper through Penta's Website,You can purchase this for $35.00 including free shpping straight from Penta's Website.<br /><br />I really enjoy drinking this. I can see a difference with my everyday life.
Helps with Heart Palpitations,"After a little bit of research, I learned that magnesium plays a crucial role in the regulation of the heart. After being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations (which never worked too well), I decided to give this supplement a try. In about 2 months, the palpitations were completely gone, and I don't have to take that horrible drug anymore! This stuff is awesome. This was about a year ago. I have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition. Your just a customer to them; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source. Magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement. Most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days, so it's very hard to get from food alone. This is the best magnesium supplement on the market. Don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store. Most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative. Magnesium citrate, of which this product is, gets assimilated easily. Don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well. Magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems. Read the book ""The Magnesium Miracle"" for more info.<br /><br />Peace."
So So Product.,"I have tried the beef and chicken flavors.  Both were very good.  This one tastes more like a tinny fish stock.  Not bad, mind you, but doesn't taste much like lobster - and if eaten as a plain broth - not good at all.<br /><br />Highly recommend the Chicken and Beef but I doubt I'll buy the Lobster again."
gift,"The packaging looked nice but excessive and the actual contents were somewhat disappointing.  The actual amount of tea in the individual small plastic baggies in the small bamboo box in the shredded paper padding within the larger bamboo box within the paper wrapping within the cardboard box within the plastic air packets within the shipping box was miniscule.  The bamboo box that it came in that houses the teapot and box of tea is cute but not the sturdiest thing ever.  I hope I never drop it.  It's also a lot bigger than I realized it would be.  As for the teapot, it's cute but a good glass teapot doesn't have the sort of imperfections you can see in this (unless I'm just unlucky in getting the one with the bubbles).<br /><br />Lowest price I've seen this here: about $18"
A Staple in My Kitchen,"I was very happy to see Amazon sold Goya seasoning in the bulk. I use it alot and it keeps me from running to the super market all the time.The packets are fresh and they keep well, also the price is a plus as I save money on them. You can not find this in most super markets where I live. Thank you Amazon!"
makes pill time a treat,"I have to give my do meds twice a day, and these pockets make it so easy. I prefill  at least a week at a time, and keep them in tuperware. Every morning and evening I say ""Time for medicine."" , and he comes running."
love it,"first exposed to this product at the RnR NOLA Marathon - it was the sponsored beverage on the course.  It piqued my curiosity so I decided to give it a try.  Been using it for over a month now on a regular basis and really love it.<br />Have tried the GoGrape and Tangy Orange (I think that's the name) and the orange one has a stronger flavor in that the flavor is more present.  The GoGrape is a little less present.  They're both tasty though.  With the orange I use 1 scoop for training and the recommended 2 scoops for races and flavor is great - 1 scoop doesn't taste weak or watered down (despite actually being watered down).  With grape, unless I use 2 scoops it tastes weak."
"No aftertaste, no need to stir",I've tried a lot of artificial sweeteners and several brands of Stevia and this is my favorite.  There is no need to stir it like some with extra fiber and there is no aftertaste like many artificial sweeteners.
Disappointed!,We are on the Ideal Protein diet and need dressings that have no calories. These fit the bill but are not edible. What a disappointment! Perhaps the other flavors are better but I thought that just about anyone could get Blu Cheese and Ranch dressing flavored right. Not so! They are awful.
"Love the puree, hate the price","Our cats love this stuff, and we love what it does for the cats' digestion.<br /><br />Price seems to have jumped pretty high recently on Amazon.  We shopped around on the Web and found cheaper sources.<br /><br />Free market at work."
LOVE IT,"If you are a fan of REAL ginger-beer, this is your best option.<br /><br />It is absolutely DELICIOUS. Not overly sweet like a lot of brands i've had at whole food markets and such."
My dog loves this,My dog loves this food. She seems very happy and has been looking good. Her coat is so pretty and shiny. I asked her how she liked it and she only barked but she seemed excited about it.
Exhausting kiddos!,"I have a 5 month old, a preschooler, and a teenager so I'm forever tired!  I hated the taste, but it did what I needed it to do. I got energy enough to keep going, but not so much that I was jittery. When it wore off I also didn't crash out like other products powered with caffeine. I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
Yummy,I love PB2! It tastes just like peanut butter with out the fat and calories and works great with my visalus shakes!
organic cookies,All Kashi products are healthy.  The cookies are low in sugar and fat and made with ingredients that are recognizable!  They're soft and taste good:)
Love it!,"Our cats LOVE the CatIt fountain, but the filters are hard to find around here.  So glad that I can get them on Amazon!"
Wow Excellent,The Celebration pack is great! Lots of food for a real good price.<br />I highly recommend this package.
Best Coffee Ever,"If you have never tried Greek or Turkish coffee you really must try this first, you will save time finding the best brand. Absolutely amazing flavor, also try eating a few dates after to complement the coffee taste."
"""lil salty but good""","These pretzels are pretty good. By accident I ordered 2 boxes and had a ton of them. The expiration date was June and I got them in March and was kinda nervous, but we are down to out last 2 bags...many of our friends have enjoyed them! They are very crunchy because they are very thin. They are not like a snyders if that's what your looking for."
Pizza lover,Received 2 boxes of double pack cheese pizza mixes.  Not what was advertised.  You can find less expensive options so beware.
Awesome Crisps!!! Arrived in just 8 days in Texas from England!!!!,"These crisps are my favorite.  I ordered these expecting to get them in a month or two, and to my surprise they arrived in just 8 days!!!<br />I immediately ordered 8 more 6 packs, as my entire family wants these crisps.<br />Fantastic company I ordered from.  I am more than pleased!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X9XTIE"">Walkers Worcester Sauce Crisps 6 Pack 150g</a>"
Fabulous!,"This is great coffee and for K-Cups, you can't beat the price!  It shipped quickly as I had it within 3 days of placing my order! For the price, I will definitely buy more of this size & brand in the future.  I wish there were more flavors available in this quantity & price."
Excellent tasting tea.,"I have tried many OOlong teas and this is by far the best.  It has a wonderfully light coconut, mango flavor.  The two flavors blend well together, neither one overpowering the other.  I will definitely buy again."
Swampy!,"Smells like a peat bog.  My officemate complains every time I drink it.  And it doesn't taste all that great, so I don't often."
Delish!,I am always on the lookout for organic products that I can give to my kids.  These are a favorite in our house!
What's not to love...,"Just right...bold enough to carry the morning without a bite.  Perfect, you will not go wrong with Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold."
Can't feed it to my dogs.,"Unfortunately , the description of this product ( milo's kitchen chicken grillers) is incomplete.  I bought it and found out it is made in china (which I am not against) but it is made from irradiated chicken (has the symbol on the back of the package).  My dog almost died 3 years ago because we were feeding her treats, which we were unaware was radiated.  So, I don't recommend this product because of this."
great for travel,"I travel a lot and am always eating breakfast in a hotel room.  This is a great alternative to other hotel breakfast options, which are usually nothing more than donuts or a danish.  If you're looking to start the day right with something nutritious, I highly recommend getting some of these.  They're really helped me to keep my body in shape, but I get the added benefit of having a lot more energy.  Love these!"
"Buy this cat food, great quality, reasonable price!!!","This is an excellent high quality cat food at a reasonable price.  While it is double the price of your average store cat food like 9 lives, it truly saves you money in the end.  I have noticed over 3 months of use that my cats are eating less as they are more satisfied now and getting the nutrients they need.  I purchase cat food literally half as often so in the end am spending the same as if buying a poorer quality food. Also believe it or not, there is far less in the litter boxes now (no doubt due to less processed junk to eliminate and eating less quantity)so in the end I'm saving on litter as well.  The best part is there is a notable difference in my cats health.  All have shinier, softer coats and my 5 year old boy jack seems to be suffering less with allergies and his sensitive stomach.  Definitly a wonderful buy and a great product!!!  Shipped fast."
Like a bowl of sugar,"The product, Quaker Instant Oatmeal, High Fiber, Maple and Brown Sugar, was extremely sweet.  Way too much sugar taste.  I could even taste salt?  I could not taste the oats due to the high sugar content.  The product was mixed with 1/2 cup boiling water per the instructions.  UPC 30000 26190."
Gluten-Free Energy!,"I've tried some of the other versions these, but I keep coming back to the Peanut Butter.  They taste great, are very satisfying and high in protein!  They beat Balance bars for me."
doesn't taste like a protein bar,"Among the various protein bars I've tried, Power Crunch and Oh Yeah! are the best.  For one thing, they don't taste like a protein bar, more like a regular candy bar.  Peanut Butter Fudge is my favorite flavor.  Triple Chocolate is also very good."
More Than One Way to Get Your Fiber One,"Fiber One with milk is good.  Add thawed or fresh fruit and it's even better.  Try it with nonfat probiotic yogurt and fruit: perhaps a little artificial sweetener and you have a great breakfast or snack.  I like using nonfat plain yogurt and adding fruit and spices(cinnamon, anyone?).  All the flavored yogurts have sugar (empty calories) added.  There's no better way to get your fiber!"
"Good stuff, but overpriced","I do like this coffee, but even with Subscribe and Save, Amazon's price is higher than K-cups at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Convenience is one thing, but since there are BB&Bs all around me, it's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks.  I wish Amazon would price their coffees more competitively - I'd buy here exclusively if they did.  But this is good, medium roast coffee.  Not quite as strong as I'd like, but a little stronger than the Breakfast in Bed version.  I may need to try Sorrento and see if it's a little bolder."
Excellent tea,"This PG tips tea is the best tea I have ever had. It is smooth and barely astringent. It brews a very dark color but doesn't have that bitter strong flavor I usually associate with dark tea. The tea bag is a triangle with no string attached. I accidentally left the bag brewing while I did household chores. By the time I got to it I was sure it would be foul, but I was pleasantly surprised with a great cup of tea."
Only flavor I did not like at all,"I like all of the flavors to a degree, except this one.  It's really salty and the combination of flavors isn't good."
Devil Brownies,"You can now stop searching! - The best brownies on earth can be found on this website. If you enjoy lavish, ultra-rich brownies, an impressive selection, stellar customer service and high product quality this is the site for you!  Always delicious, never disappoints! A family favorite!"
Parboil Spinach Lasagna Noodles -- No,"I spent a lot of time making my homemade lasagna and decided to use these parboil lasagna noodles.  Turned out terrible.  I'll never invest the time and money to make homemade lasagna and use a parboil nooodle again.  It was awful.  At the end of the day I had to ask myself how lazy I could be not to take the time to cook my lasagna first.  I guess if you're making a throw-together lasagna with cottage cheese, this would be fine.  But I was making my sauce from scratch and using ricotta and other real ingredients.  Took forever to cook, spilled over in the oven (after adding the recommended 3/4 cup of water to my recipe which is another mess I have to confront).  So, no, we couldn't taste the specialness of the spinach noodles because, quite frankly, they weren't really cooked.  I wasted all day cooking my favorite lasagna only to have it ruined by these parboil noodles.  I have purchased other pasta from Rossi that was absolutely delicious but when it comes to lasagna, I say don't be tempted by the ""parboil"" feature.  I'll buy these again but cook before I put them in my lasagna."
mackerel cat food,"Is what it says, a whole mackerel in a can.  Our cats love this, much better than ground fish food in a can (and who knows what all is in that stuff.)  Plenty of juice along with the whole fish.<br /><br />Looks good enough for human consumption, our cats love it !!"
Say it ain't so!,"While my younger self would swear up and down that no such thing would ever be uttered, much less typed, regarding the amount of sugar in a snack, I have to disappoint that little boy I used to be. These cookies are indeed good, but they are just over the line of being too sweet to become a regular purchase. The standard chewy Chips Ahoy cookies are pretty darn close to being perfect. Adding in a fudge center might sound like a good idea, but it just ratchets up the sweetness. Don't get me wrong, the fudge is entirely too good, as is the cookie. It's just the injection of one into the other that makes it a bit too sweet for my aging palate. Nevertheless, in moderation, which is to say one to two cookies at a sitting instead of a half-dozen of the non-stuffed variety, is a nice capper to a packed lunch at work (just as it would be in a bag lunch for a school kid). I think this is a case of trying to improve perfection and falling a bit short of the original product. Kudos on the effort, but I will return to the prior incarnation."
Waste of money,"These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment."
"Great product, quick shipping","I received this product from a friend of mine who is from AZ and immediately fell in love with it.  It's slightly thicker than Tabasco and Trappey's, but not as sour, and with a little bit more heat.  It goes well with almost EVERYTHING.  So, I knew what to expect.<br /><br />I bought two large bottles.  The seller shipped the package quickly, except that the cap on one of the bottles was loose, so the hot sauce leaked a little bit; otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.  But that won't stop me from buying from them again next time I run out.<br /><br />Highly recommend to those who want a little bit of heat, without having too much of a vinegar base."
Makes a great cup of tea,"PG Tips was my favorite when I lived in England, so  I was thrilled to be able to buy it here in the US. If you like a nice flavour filled cup of tea, then, I highly recommend PG TIPS."
Bitter and tasteless,"Inexpensive and it's clear why: it's bitter and tasteless,  whether brewed for a minute or four. To be immediately relegated to ""emergentea"" at the back of the cupboard. Get this instead: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DXY0"">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, Loose Leaf, 8.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)</a>"
DELICIOUS!,"I don't much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes, but these are really very good.  They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked."
Amazing,I got this for my girlfriend on valentines day. The plant I received looked just like the picture. So did the pot it came in. She has had it for several years now and it is still growing well and healthy. I would definitely recommend it.
better than homemade,"This mix makes cookies that are so good it's not worth making them from scratch anymore. If it weren't so expensive, I'd give it five stars."
My dogs have rated Booda Bones 5 Stars!,"I have three King Charles Cavalier Spaniels and they are picky, picky eaters even when it comes to Treats.  They love the peanut flavored Booda Bones and have one every day.  They insisted I write this review on Amazon so their opinions could be known.  They're pushy that way..."
My baby absolutely loves it.,"First of all, I'd say that this product tastes more like sweet potato than chicken. The white lumpy stuff in the package tastes like brown rice pasta than chicken. So I am not where the chicken is cuz you can't taste it. But my daughter absolutely loves it. She gobbles down the whole thing in minutes (except her teething time).<br /><br />Although I am skeptical about the chicken part, I have to trust the labeling that says heavy amount of protein is in there.<br /><br />I also tried the turkey and chicken training meal from Plum brand. It has way too much spice in there. Not for my baby who is just starting out on protein. I will try the Plum brand a bit later. But you can definitely taste the meat in their products."
PB2-- a great alternative to full-fat peanut butter,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GJ9JWS"">PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz</a><br /><br /> I like the flavor of PB2, although it's not quite the same as peanut butter with fat in it.  However, as a very low calorie alternative to peanut butter, it is very good.  I love peanut butter but don't want to eat all the calories in it.  PB2 is pricey, but maybe taking the fat out of peanuts is an expensive process."
actually good,"But very sweet so read the equations before using.  Doesn't have an unpleasant taste afterwards, either."
Very tasty!,"I love them. They go really well with soups, salads, etc. I just wish that they don't come broken up so much."
Best-tasting olive oil,"I've never been able to eat olive oil until I bought Columela Arbequina Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  It has a very nice, mild taste that I quite enjoy using and tasting."
Not for those allergic to food coloring!,"I love Diamond brand foods, and was reccomended to use them by my vet when my dog developed allergies to preservatives/food colors.  I thought the Biscuits would follow the same standards.  I was disappointed to open them and find a rainbow of colored biscuits.  I try to give the bright red ones to the dog that is not allergic.  The dogs like them well enough.  They were a good deal, and if you buy colored treats, you'd probably give them 5 stars."
Great flavor,"I love this stuff with just a touch of vanilla creamer. Caramel and vanilla coffee, with the caramel slightly overpowering the vanilla, perfectly balanced with a shot of vanilla creamer. What a great flavor combination, with a heavenly aroma.<br /><br />My favorite flavored coffee."
Best I've had!,"I've tried a lot of gluten free bread mixes, but this one by far has the best taste and texture. It's versatile. I can use the same mix to make bagels as I do for pizza crust and loaves of bread. Going gluten free isn't so terrible, having this product."
1 yr old loved it- Pear and Garden greens,"If you're like me, you're cautious about what you give your little ones. If you're like me, you've also had grand plans to make/puree organic foods from scratch that fizzled out after the first few attempts.<br /><br />The Baby Gourmet Organic simple purees are great for the busy mom who gets a headache thinking about pulling the food processor out, and finding containers with lids for baby food.<br /><br />They're in squeezable packs, and while I'm not sold on the flavor combo (pear and greens?) I have a happy 1yr old who loves it :)"
soy joy,"tasty soy milk, excellent alternative to actual milk.  I like the vanilla flavor with my cereal in the morning ~"
"Best popcorn, best price by subscription",I ordered this initially just to try something less expensive than the whirly pop brands. I was really glad I did and I will continue to buy it. Everyone loves it and it is the perfect thing for the whirly pop popper. Buying it on subscription is the best way to go - decreases the price and eliminates shipping charges. This is a keeper.
sweet costco,"I love this coffee and I love Amazon.  That being said, Costco sells the exact same item for $33.00.  How can I cheat on Amazon?????"
not as intersting as i thought,"This is my first experience with matcha powder tea made at home.  It is difficult to get to froth and much more of the powder is needed than I originally thought.  I like the taste (bitter) but don't see much benefit to powder vs loose tea.  Although, clean up is very easy."
Well worth the price it costs to get this home.,"This sauce just about knocked my socks off. I am really amazed at the great taste. The heat is very slight, which I prefer, so the other flavors can also be recognized. Actually, this is better sauce than I can make even after spending hours in the kitchen. Coming from south central Texas, we are exposed to a wide variety of quality Mexican food. I've never tasted better sauce. I used a jar to make some burritos the other night and had no leftovers."
um um good,These are the freshest and best tasting Neco's I have ever tested. They will surprise even the seasoned Neco expert.
One suggestion...,"Cosmic makes the standard by which all catnip must be measured now, its that good. However I found it does need to be crushed to release the catnip scent/oils to really get the cats aroused. Otherwise my roly poly is happy to just lap it up when the intention is to get him excited to play with the 10,000 toys all around that he and housemate wait for me to entertain them with."
Great value........,"I bought these for my chihuahua/dachshund mix.  They are a little large for him, but not too large for him to sink his teeth into.  These keep him busy for hours on end!  They are also a good size for my 13 year old Rottie/Lab mix.  Great value........especially with subscribe and save.  Very happy with this product."
The Best Product,"I have no children, well I do but they are grown. This was suggested by my dog's vet, the Pumpkin settles their stomach and the apple is just a bonus but she gets a couple tablespoons mixed in her food and she loves it. Yes, I know SPOILED."
Neat new more enviromentally friendly K-Cup Option,"I was initially shocked when I initially opened my parcel and found these very cool new San Francisco Bay Coffee Organic One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 80-Count. First this is a great value at $33.00 including free shipping with my Prime Account. For those of you who have not tried Prime membership it pays for itself in between 60-90 days with moderate use and I believe Amazon still offers a 30 day free trial which is worth looking at to experience the benefits. I've had my membership for 3 years and its a great value! Enough for the the Amazon commercial back to the coffee. Price per cup is the lowest I have found anywhere at just under 42 cents. The normal K-cups are all plastic while these have a plastic ring with a fiber filter bag. Its not 100% recyclable but its a big step forward as the filter will break down quickly and the coffee grounds will then fall out allowing those to decompose as well. That leaves a small plastic ring (which looks recyclable) and foil top left. To assist to keep your coffee fresh you receive a reusable lightweight recyclable plastic tub with an airtight lid that holds about 8 K-cups for peak freshness. In addition each 8 K-Cups is sealed in a vented recyclable bag inside the box so you open one and put them in the storage tub after. Nice touch.<br /><br />This is a robust organic coffee with a smooth finish, its gives me above average caffeine buzz, please note I am not big coffee drinker, more a 1-2 good cups a day guy and I like to have variety, thus my move to a Keurig system (which I love and have spread this to 6 others in my family as well as many at my office). Thi is a good coffee with nice flavor and I also like the fact its organic, a little more recyclable and a good value. A++++"
"""Redbarn chicken jerky items are manufactured in a Chinese plant""","""Redbarn chicken jerky items are manufactured in a Chinese plant"" that is from REDBARN's website.<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to caution consumers about a potential association between the development of illness in dogs and the consumption of chicken jerky products. The products--also called chicken tenders, strips, or treats--are imported from China. FDA continues to receive complaints of sick dogs that their owners or veterinarians associate with eating chicken jerky products."
For those concerned about bitterness...,"I noticed that a number of reviewers commented on the ""bitterness"" of the Bariani extra virgin olive oil.  I tried out both their 2010 ""early harvest"" (green) olive oil and their regular fall 2010 olive oil.  I found their green olive oil to have a stronger, grassy (they mention the high chlorophyll content, which you do get!) flavor, with a distinct bitter edge and peppery finish.  This would be great for someone who gravitates toward a greener, bolder flavor and perhaps a more adventurous experience.  I found it too bitter for my pestos though it worked just fine with roasted chicken, and I think would be great for dipping bread.  Their regular extra virgin olive oil has a faint bitter, peppery finish, but overall a more neutral flavor -- good all around olive oil and a safer bet for those who are sensitive to bitter or stronger flavors."
Jello that's good for you,"I was recommended to this product by a nutritionist, and have been really happy with it. Make your own gelatin using hot water and fruit juice, no sugar, nothing artificial, tastes great and it's good for you.  Dissolve three tablespoons of gelatin powder in two cups of fruit juice, stir and let sit for a minute or two, add one cup of hot water, and put in a pan to cool for a few hours.  You can add some fresh fruit, walnuts, anything you like.  Yummy, especially with creme fraiche on top."
Guava paste,Thank you for the product.  I grew up in South America and loved guava. I couldn't find it locally and I am very pleased withthis product!!
Wolfgang knows how to brew it!,"My favorite of the Wolfgang series discovered when trying all of the flavors in the available sample pack. Very good flavor, consistent with each pod and not overdone with added flavors. Very good dark roast Colombian cup of coffee from the Wolf."
It really depends on your cats.,My cats wouldn't even touch them. They just pawed them around a bit. Too bad it's a non-returnable item. Good luck.
Great decaf green tea,This is a great green tea.  It has a good clean flavor and no grittiness.  I couldn't truly appreciate how good this tea was until I tried a different brand and found the other one to be terrible.  I can usually get two good cups of tea from one bag.  I highly recommend this and it's the only one I'll ever buy!
Great coffee at a reasonable price,"I really enjoy this bold roast organic coffee.  Great flavor, taste, and aroma.  I look forward to more varieties available through the subscribe and save option!<br /><br />Highly recommended."
My Mom's Love the Coffee,This coffee was a gift for my mother. She says she really liked the taste. Mom likes a bold coffee and this blend suited her just fine.
Response to the 2-star review...,"To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your ""wrathful"" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs."
Not what I expected,I should have read the ingredients list before purchasing this - they are not plain roasted walnuts or tasty roasted walnuts. I did not care for them at all. Strange combination of sugar and garlic coating.
love these,"They are a little more expensive here, even with subscribe and save, than if I would buy just regular ones in a store around here.  But I am a fan of cranberry and pomegranate, so I am okay with that."
Great Coffee and Great Price,"I love these K-cups they are wonderful.  I have bought hazelnut, French Vanilla, Caramel and Caramel Apple Cider.  I love<br />each one.  They are absolutely terrific."
Cappaccino Vanilla,I cannot locate this product anywhere locally.  Tried the local coffee houses.  The product they use for cappaccino has a lot of sugar in it.<br /><br />The product I purchased from Amazon which I have been using for a number of years has minimal sugar in it and a strong vanilla flavor which I like.  So glad you can provide it for me.<br /><br />Thank you.
Not so crazy for these,These are so-so..not the real biscotti but a little to crumbly for my taste..they taste like cookie crumbs mashed together.
"Taste good, but has strange lumps of stuff (aloe?) in it","Tastes good, sweet, but not overly so. The lumps of aloe pieces are a bit strange though, soft & kind of mushy - not my favorite part. Tastes great otherwise.<br /><br />I think it would be far better without the pieces of aloe in it - would be better if blended into the drink.<br /><br />Sweetened with cane sugar, so not as bad as some drinks with beet or other sugars.<br /><br />22 carbs per bottle & 28g of sodium, so not good for those sensitive to sodium.<br /><br />It would be better if they dropped the sodium & got rid of the lumps of aloe."
"Brittle Yes, Peanuts - Not Many - Enjoy the Review","When I ordered a week ago, no other reviews existed.<br /><br />So let's set the stage as they say.  It's 3:00am and the guilt from watching the last P90X infomercial while eating ice cream had just worn off.  Suddenly as if Billy Maze himself had yelled it through my TV - I got the craving for some Peanut Brittle.<br /><br />Not being one who needs instant gratification I turned to my old friends at Amazon. I figured ... If I were to order food, sight unseen ... peanut brittle in fact, it seems reasonable to order form a company called THE PEANUT COMPANY of Virginia.<br /><br />Well - The items arrives well wrapped and protected from Amazon with no visible damage to the outside of the box. The contents however were a different story.<br /><br />Which is kind of the disappointment here. The brittle arrived in such small pieces that a lot of it being simply brittle dust. On what pieces were not completely incinerated you were lucky to have maybe 1-2 actual peanuts, These were caramelized and stale like the rest of the product reminiscent of something your grandmother put out  when surprised by an unexpected distant relative.<br /><br />Now it is possible - that The Peanut Company of Virginias has one employee who suffers from an extreme peanut allergy as to only be able to toss in 11 peanuts into the brittle mix before having to run for their inhaler and in running coincidentally tripped and crushed the box of brittle... and in his dismay, hid the box for 4 years in shame before it was accidentally found and used to fulfill my order. But ...there is also the possibility, that if you like real peanut brittle your better off buying from a store where you can see the product first. See my pic<br /><br />Good Chomping :-)"
Popcorn,"We have a 4 oz stand up electric popcorn popper and find 4 oz bags a little hard to come by. This popcorn, salt and oil is 6 ozs and work perfectly in out 4 oz popper. About 80 to 90% of the grains pop and that is our only complaint. We have tested the kettle at very hot and at start up tempatures and there is still at least 10% of the grains unpopped. What are we doing wrong?"
"Fine Textured, More Salt Taste Than Butter","Received this shipment promptly, and it should last a lifetime !! The taste is salty. I think I expected more of a buttery flavor. I think I'd have to use way too much of it in order to get a butter taste, and I don't need that much sodium! Thus, the 3 stars. It is very fine textured, and just right for sprinkling on popcorn, but I plan to try it on baked potatoes, vegetables etc. [after all, I have a case of it]<br /><br />This is the only buttery seasoning I've tried so far in my guest for movie theater tasting popcorn. I don't think I'd recommend buying a case of 12 to anyone, unless you go in with other people and split it a few ways. I did look for this in several grocery stores, and was unable to find it. That's the reason I ordered it as I did. It was only available as a case.<br /><br />Something I have found in ""my movie theater popcorn quest""  is using buttery flavor spray from the dairy section. The one that says I Can't Believe It's Not on the label. It's good to take it out of the fridge a little while before using to let the chill leave it. It's not bad on popcorn and baked potatoes, Irish or sweet."
"It's OK.... Just not ""great""","This cereal was more like candy, with a slightly odd taste.  It did have a unique texture, from the creamy chocolate filling to the crispy cereal outside.  I didn't see much value, nutritionally, and it didn't keep me full or satisfied, at least in the amount that was specified for a serving size.  I give is 4 stars for snack candy value, butonly about 2 stars as a breakfast food."
Orange Orange Everywhere,"I was looking for a new snack item. Someone told me to look for flavored popcorns. Not sure what to expect when I purchased this.<br />Well...Pleasantly surprised. The taste is a cross between Cheetos  and Cheesits. Popcorn pops very well with only 10-12 un-popped kernels.  BE PREPARED! Messy popcorn but Oh So Good!  The coloring is as expected orange. You can confirm this by touching anything after you have a handful. Paper towels are a must. Addictive, Messy, Easy to Prepare, what more can you expect of a snack."
Good but not great,"I have used both this JP coffee and the french roast.  The first time I got a fresh-tasting batch, but neither this nor the french roast has held up since.  That first batch had the aroma and taste of freshly roasted beans, all the others (and I've used this for about 2 years) give the impression that they've been on the shelf a while.<br /><br />I'm forced to drink decaf, so I intend to get locally sourced, top-end, quality coffee with a high stock turnover rate."
read the comment :D,"I would just like to say that this company producing roasted almonds is by far the best tasting almonds I have ever had...they are the perfect most tastiest treat on the go whenever you need one and it is really pleasing to have. Its heart food and I like it. This will be a staple snack for me FOREVER :D if anyone in the company reads this comment, I really encourage you to make a WIDE ARRAY of flavors...it would be very interesting and unique. You guys have A LOT of good ones now..but imagine other possibilities. GO AT IT :D!!!"
Very fresh product,"Received these quickly by prime and have not had the quality problem that other reviewers have noted. The nuts are all a good large size and the package had a good expiration date. Did take off one star because the shells seem to be harder to crack than the ones I have had before, could be because I'm getting older."
Best Fat Free Hot Cocoa Mix ever!!,Was able to purchase this item in grocery stores in Oklahoma City.  Not so after I moved to Cape Coral.  Was glad to see that I could order it online.  I add it to my coffee and it makes a great Mocha!
Best GF pretzels!,I love these pretzels and the Amazon price makes them even better.  They are $8.19 in my local store so I gave up buying them until I found them on Amazon.<br />They taste better than wheat pretzels to me.  My GF kids love them too!
Good price for great tasting water,I can be picky about what water I drink and Smart Water happens to be one brand that I really enjoy. This price is pretty good for what you get.
A perfect compromise between a FinnCrisp and a Wasa,"Kavli Hearty Thick maybe my new favorite crisp bread!  It is actually more a ""medium thick"" crisp.  More more robust than a FinnCrisp or a Wasa Thin & Crispy, but much thinner than a full sized Wasa or RyeVita.  They have a rich rye flavor and hold up well to strongly flavored toppings like kippers or sprats.  To top it off, they're yeast free, have no GMO's, and only 30 calories a cracker."
Best Lime Juice EVER!,"I moved away from a grocer that carried this and was very upset until I found it here.  The best there is.<br /><br />Wish it came in singles though, as I won't use 12 in 5 years...."
Very good on a cold morning...,"I like this product a lot during the cool winter months.  Something about a warm breakfast just makes the whole day better, and this is a quick and easy way to get one.  I like to make mine with milk instead of water, and my girlfriend adds extra brown sugar to hers.<br /><br />However, it is not as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5TRK"">McCANN'S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, but the price for Quaker is usually about a third less and the Quaker is easier to find at the grocery store."
Surprising way to season!,"When I got this product and opened it at first I was a little thrown. Instead of what I was expecting, a pouch or some kind of container of a brownish spicy powder, what I got was this fancy case, a charger of some kind and a bracelet that says wisdom and courage on it! Well I followed the instructions, plugged the charger into my kabob meat, zipped it up in the case, put on the bracelet and waited for one hour. When I took the meat out it was incredibly well seasoned and smelled so good cooking that I burned my fingers on it because I could not wait to taste it. But thanks to the handy bracelet I found the courage (and wisdom) to get through the pain and take another bite!  Incredible! Best kabobs I've ever tasted and my neighbors all want to know my secret. (I'll never tell, tee hee!)<br /><br />Update: For some reasons the manufacturer has changed this product, now instead of the incredibly high tech version you used to get, you will recieve the inferior ""tube of hurl"" version you see pictured. If you want to season your kebabs with something that looks exactly like something you might find on the ground at the local dog park then by all means, enjoy your fecal kebabs. As a lover of finely spiced meat dishes I can say that seeking out the original version with the faux leather case, charger and courage/wisdom band is well worth the effort. Until then I will be enjoying my kebabs au natural, thank you very much."
Have a delicious day!,"Have a delicious day! Wish I wrote that but it's off the box.So is this ""We make glutenfree delicious..it's what we do"" and boy did Glutenfreeda do it again.I've been hooked on Glutenfreeda products since they introduced their frozen cookies years ago. I was delighted to see them come out with instant oatmeal and I wasn't disappointed.I was doubly delighted to see the oatmeal offered on Amazon.com. Win,win! When you read the ingredient list you will see why- Off the Maple Raisin with Flax box :certified gluten free oats, raisins, organic maple sugar,brown sugar , flax meal and salt.That's it and yes you read the ingredient list correctly.Real ingredients for my real family.I was very happy to see a very low sodium content and the addition of flax.<br /><br />I always have a packet with me for a quick snack or those ""eat at the desk"" lunches. My husband who is not on the gluten free diet loves this oatmeal.He says the oats taste fresher. And for my Celiac college student this product has made his life so much easier.He can have a healthy breakfast in his dorm room or at the food court with no worry of cross-contamination.Like me he always has a packet in his backpack for snacks or a quick lunch.<br /><br />Thank you Glutenfreeda!"
Irish creme review,"I Love my Highlander Grogg, a must have every morning. I wanted to try something a bit different and ordered the Irish Creme. It was OK, just not as good as some I've had, but thanks for trying."
Not bad but not as shown or named,"Pros:  (1) It arrived in very good condition; (2) It will take some work but could become a decent bonsai. I like this because I want to create my own bonsai from a pre-bonsai. (3) I would buy another from Brussels if the price is right but I want a picture of exactly what I am buying.<br /><br />Cons: (1) Mine was NOT as shown. The one shown had nice nebari & branching, mine turned out to be an exposed root style and overgrown. (2) It is as stated in the description as a Buxus Microphylla 'Dwarf Saunders' which I actually like because it is small but faster growing than a true Kingsville - a Buxus Microphylla `Compacta`.  So this is as much pro as con. But should be made clear by the seller just what it is and also if a 'Dwarf Saunders' is a varietal, a cross breed or what.<br /><br />Summary: Put in the correct photo, provide the correct detailed botanical name, do not imply that it is a true Kingsville.  It is fairly priced, not a super deal."
Essentia Water Pretty Good,I enjoyed the taste of this water whether cold from the fridge or room temperature. I did not notice any aftertaste. I found it very refreshing and felt quite hydrated. Great product!
VERY Hard,"This was a very good price, Would never buy it again. There was no jerk, only crunch. Flavor was ok."
Good on the Go...,"If you are looking for a quick breakfast or a tasty snack you can't go wrong with the ""Whenever Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Bars."" They are fairly small and about the size of your palm. They taste a bit like a moist oatmeal cookie but with more interesting flavors. The walnuts are fresh and crunchy and the raisins add a little more sweetness. These bars have interesting ingredients like coconut sugar, chia seeds and organic agave. These bars are good on the go...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
Good Packaging for our Family,Good packaging for our family - coffee is already contained in its own filter and is pre-measured for one pot of coffee. No mess measuring coffee when you're half asleep and I set a timer for the coffee pot to start brewing the next morning. Perfect!
Don't last,"My dogs are 12 LB, they love to chew, I thought I would try these StarMark, I bought a 2 pack medium, didn't even last a day. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!<br />I need to buy Thick bully sticks they last about a week. (Where and when I can find Thick Bulky sticks at a inexpensive price)"
Crispy snacks....,"Well, they're not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but I won't be reordering.  While the volume of the bag was very good for a snack, the flavor wasn't that great. Kind of ""artificial"".  This goes under the been-there-done-that list."
Harry Potter Bertie Botts,"We LOVED these.  The boxes were very small, like the size raisins come in.  But in the end, you'll never eat them all.  The flavors are fun and crazy, our Harry Potter sleepover with school friends was a hoot, and this product took it over the top.  We only used one box for the evening.  So, we're planning another HP sleepover...lol."
better packaging please...,The box was undamaged but 4 of the creamers had leaked anyhow and there was a sticky mess all over the inside and on the other creamers. I had to rinse them off and check each one for leaks...<br />192 is a lot of creamers. See picture above.<br />They are delicious.<br />They might make your boss think you are actually putting Irish cream in your coffee if he smells it?
Great Product,"As a diabetic and an Obese person I must limit my Sodium.  Morton's Salt Substitute is the perfect replacement for Salt.  It has the taste of Salt without the harmful Sodium.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00473QUGO"">Morton Salt Substitute, 3.12-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>"
Tortellini,The Ferrara Tortellini if a very good value.  I made it both hot with sauce and with meat and cheese in a cold salad.  It is quite tasty.
My puppy loves it,"This is definately chihuahua puppy approved. I like the fact that there is a puppy food for smaller breeds. These are real small bites. My puppy was 2.16 lbs at 7 weeks and tiny, so having something that is small enough for him to chew. At 5.5 months old, he still enjoys it. I also like that this small bag is resealable and helps with keeping it fresh."
One of my Shepherd's favorites,"The Red Barn Lamb roll is one of my german shepherd's favorite varieties of the meat roll ""family"" of products.  I really do trust the brand name because I have been using this brand for many many years with different breeds of dogs.  When holidays come around and there are sales promotions for this brand, I always try to buy the most I can afford at the time and really do save money.Lori, Phila."
yummy and low fat,"Discovered these at M.O.M.'s (My Organic Market) in Maryland. They came in large bags and the taste and texture really grew on me, so I checkd on Amazon and voila, small bags, bought a case, I am a happy camper!"
The only cat food my cat eats and loves,My picky eater cat is getting older and rejects plenty of other cat foods. She loves this one and has less shedding because of the ingredients in this food.
"Dog loves it, but it's LOUD","I got this and the ""tricky treat ball"" in the same order.  Both are treat-dispensing toys that keep dogs occupied for longer than most other toys.  My basset hound likes both toys, but seems to really like the tug-a-jug.  I put his kibble in there and it keep him occupied for quite a while.  He really likes grabbing the rope, and unlike the picture the rope on mine is made of rubber instead of twine.  It will probably not last long.  Also, this toy is LOUD.  Much louder than the tricky treat ball.  But, he seems to prefer this over the ball, so it gets my recommendation."
Great Long Lasting NRG/ Energy... Take the Right Dosage!,"I picked this up at Costco at a pretty good deal after seeing this here. Best next thing to my old Vivarin fix but better as it is in somewhat of a food form without the crash.  Do NOT take this more than the recommended 5 Hour intervals!  First you'll be wired and more on the EDGE than anything.  Taking two of these in less than 9 or 10 hours was a shock to my system and it actually knocked me out for a minute, but after that I was wired more than anything, almost ready to fly!!  Again great booster, maybe too great sometimes. You gotta remember this is basically a double shot of the regular.  You could probably just drink 1/2 of these and get the same effect of the original obviously."
My father's favourite,"I bought this mix for my father after a recommendation from a friend, and my father loves it so much, I had to order more for him."
tasty!,"I used this in cakes, cup cakes and candies, its great in drinks i found as well as long as your making mixed drinks. I really enjoyed this produce and i urge people to try this and experiment with it, be adventurous with your cooking and the flavors you use its truly worth it!"
Terrible,Bought this flavor because it sounded soo good but after making the first cup I realized that names can be deceiving. The sweetener aspect of the drink taste like sweet-n-low instead of sugar and has a bad after taste. Save ur money this  is not worth it.
Where's the mint?,"I love Westsoy products. And this is no exception -- Westsoy Chocolate Peppermint Stick Soy Beverage has a deep chocolate flavor, is thick and rich, but .... peppermint? I can barely taste the peppermint. I ended up adding my own peppermint from my peppermint flavor bottle."
Better than US version,"I really don't understand why, but the English Breakfast tea made for UK is mountains better than the US version sold in the US grocery stores. We have colleagues in UK, and someone brought this version of the tea, and I couldn't believe how much smoother it tasted, compared to all the other brands I tried in US. So if you like smooth taste, this is the one to try."
"Pops well, not much flavor","I liked the idea of the small popcorn.  It pops up really well in the popper but it doesn't have much if any ""popcorn"" flavor.  Was pretty bummed by that."
Great for my older dogs...,"I've been getting these treats for the last year for my two senior dogs.  Both have had various hip and joint problems in the past, but have not had any problems since they've been taking these.  And they love them!  I've tried all the flavors, and have not had a problem with them eating it.  They think it's a yummy treat, and get excited when I pull them out.  I would definitely recommend for anyone with older dogs."
"Dog 0, Bone 1","My sis rescued a pitbull/Lab puppy. She's a teething, chewing machine. All previous bones and chew treats are demolished within minutes, despite all claims to be long-lasting. However, this bone continues to be gnawed on, a full month after purchase. Worth every penny. Bone wins!"
Just not that good,"I shared this with a group of my coworkers. We all tried it and though we all thought it was okay taste and ease of use wise, none of us were really that sold on the taste. Either it became way too watery, or when it was strong it just did not taste very good."
My Must Have,"After having discovered Steaz Berry Energy green tea several years ago, it's my favorite cold drink. It's refreshing, tasty, and carbonated...helpful with my aging digestion issues. The caffeine does not cause a buzz and then a crash. Another plus is that an opened can doesn't get ""flat"". Using Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"" is the deal!"
I agree I could eat em all day though,I love these things they have a perfect flavor. I wish I could just eat these and eat em all day long!!!!!!!!!!
very nice kit,"Colors are very vibrant, colored the fondant and the modeling chocolate I was using for a birthday cake well without having to use a lot of color. would recommend this to anyone."
Alternate meat source = less itchy dog,"My dog started developing signs of an allergy last year - nothing overt - just noticable skin twitches when I touched her in certain areas on her back.  Unsure if her reactions were due to environment or food, but they didn't seem to be seasonal grass allergies, so I chose to test the easiest source first.  I chose a food with a completely different meat source, switching from chicken to fish.  It's only been a week and I'm already seeing improvement.  She's still showing signs of itchiness, but her reaction is much less when I pet her back.  And on top of that, her fur is softer too!  It's early yet, and there can still be some progress made, but I have no doubt that the change in food is helping.  I sat and read review after review on dog foods with in-depth ingredient analysis before settling on Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato.  If after 6 weeks, she still shows some signs of being itchy, I'll happily try the Salmon and Potato Grain Free variety to see if grains are a factor in her allergies as well.<br /><br />Have seen some reviews mentioning breath after eating the fish based foods.  I have to say, I haven't experienced this with my dogs.  There might be a slightly different odor to their breath, but it isn't by any means too ""fishy"" smelling.  Just different.  And neither dog has experienced any gasiness or changes in stool since the switch was done gradually."
watch out...,"I would have preferred to directly inform the company that makes this product vs. writing a review on Amazon but I couldn't find a way to do that.<br /><br />First I would like to thank the makers of Lickety Stik for donating these things to a Canine Cancer walk I participated in this weekend.<br /><br />I have 2 dogs, as it seemed, one dog liked it and the other did not.<br /><br />I screwed the cap back on and put it on the counter while I took a shower and when I came out I found the Lickety Stik butsted open on my couch and leaking all over the place.  The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak."
I love this pancake mix,"I love this pancake mix. Can not find this exact one in any stores so I always order online and keep in stock at home. All you do is mix with water (I add fresh chopped banana's or strawberries for a healthy option, and swap syrup for honey) and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast."
"Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Vienna Coffee House","great tasting coffee. strong, but not obnoxiously strong and no nasty aftertaste. too bad, it cannot be purchased on subscribe and save anymore."
Can't say enough good things!,"This cocoanut oil has become a staple in our kitchen for all of our cooking oil or butter needs needs. It is great for frying, spread on toast and adding to many recipes calling for butter. The flavor is great in any use and highly recommend it."
Great for Training,"I love working with Zukes because they are small, and they aren't slimy.  They are a wonderful training treat because you can reward often.  Particularly useful with Clicker training!  And in peanut butter, the smell isn't offensive to the trainer.  Chicken's good too-"
Delicous!!,These just maybe one of my favorite Kind bars. I enjoy grabbing one as that chocolate craving comes in the afternoon. This bar is a must for snacks. I will definatly keep these bars coming every month.
good stuff,We love this agave nectar.  The taste is like something between honey and syrup and it has a very low glycemic index so no problems with blood sugar issues.<br />The best price I have found as well!  Thanks
Hands-down the most flavorful hot sauce ever,"I tried this first at an authentic Mexican restaurant we used to frequent. Just a few drops here and there on a dish would make the flavor really pop. Now we keep it on hand at home and use it on all kinds of things. I put it in chili, mix it into mayo for a zesty sandwich spread, use it liberally when I'm in the mood to have my eyeballs fall out, etc. Now that I've had this sauce, nothing else will do!"
I was dissapointed,"The salmon and potatoes was not what I ordered. My dog was using salmon and rice from Simple and I went to Amazon, to my last order and reorder the product.  What I received was the Salmon and potatoes.  Since I was out of his food I did give him the new product and now he his having allergy problems again.  I am dissapointed and will need to find a new food for him. He loves the taste but I would have though I would be notified that this was not the product on my products page."
these are the jam,"The clusters are my favorite treat.  I have been counting calories for close to a year and these are my savior.  I love candy bars but average sized ones are usually 300-400 calories or more.  These satisfy that same craving at 120 calories.  They are sweet, crunchy, chewy and even a little salty.  The portion is just right. One of these a day keeps me on track- totally worth $3.50 a week any way you look at it."
My Dogs Favorite,"My Dogs are not picky - what labador is?  But when it come to treats they clearly prefer these.  So do I - they made from whole, human grade, healthy, USA grown ingredients."
Great caffeine laden tea,"I've been drinking this Stash jasmine blossom green tea for the past 5 years because it's loaded with an unexpected kick of caffeine.  It's a good afternoon energy boost if you're not into coffee past 12PM, like me.  Give it a try.  The taste is decent too, make sure to drink it while it's very hot."
Could Convert a Vegan!,"A favorite of my family and has forever ruined ordering steak at restaurants because their steaks cannot hold a candle to ours.  We tried this as a sample at Sams Club a few years ago and enjoyed the savory taste it added to our steaks ever since. Steak Dust does not overpower the steak with spices, rather it accentuates the natural steak goodness. I couldn't believe it when Sams discontinued carrying Steak Dust and searched all over for it.  Thankfully, Amazon carries it.  Friends and family always compliment the tastes of our steaks because of the Steak Dust Seasoning.  I'm salivating right now just writing this review.  Mmmm.....Steak Dust."
Original PopChips,"Bought the Original flavor from the store and just tried them tonight. They were very greasy and salty. I did not like them a lot. I will not purchase this original flavor again. However I can't complain because I got the 3 ounce bag for only $1.00 at the store while they were on sale. I tried the BBq flavor and they are delicious. I bought the sea salt & vinegar, and cheddar but haven't tried those yet."
Very good Hot Chocolate,This Hot chocolate is very good. It has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor. The price is a very good deal and more than worth it!
Great side dish,Great and easy side dish only complaint is time it takes to make it is twice as long as other rice roni
If you love Sesame Seeds you will love this candy!,When I was a kid my parents used to have these Sesame Honey Crunch candies in our house and I loved them so much!  As I grew up I forgot about them until recently it came up in conversation at a family party.  I ordered a bag of these Sesame Honey Crunch and they are just as delicious as I had remembered!!  I shared them with my family and now we are all addicted to them AGAIN!!  I regularly order these!
Yum! Yum! Yum!,"With all the meds I take, I have a lot of problems with my stomach. I try a cracker first, when nausea hits, with Gaviscon or Tums being the next up to bat if that doesn't work.<br /><br />These are so wonderfully yummy that I then bought the Pumpkin Seed Cheddar too! The flatbread is great alone, or used instead of bread.  The crunch is intense, although I love it that way. I keep these next to my chair and next to my bed and look forward to trying other flavors too."
Lundberg Sweet Brown Rice,The rice came faster than I thought possible.  The service was excellent.<br />We grind this rice into flour.  This is a great rice flour for people that cannot eat gluten.
Diet Pasta,"If your on a diet eat this pasta it won't spike your insulin intake to high.<br /><br />Taste Great, east this to stay healthy.<br /><br />-T-"
"Contents not as listed, but still looks and tastes great!","Received this today. I purchased it as a gift so I won't be able to rate it for tastiness until Christmas, but I did want to note that the included liquors are not as listed in the description. While it does include the Cointreau, the Grand Marnier, the Cutty Sark, the Jack Daniels', and the Galliano, the other three are different than what is described. The description says the other three are Danzka Cranberyraz Vodka, Drambuie, and Borghetti, but instead they are Sauza Tequila Gold, Malibu Caribbean Rum, and Southern Comfort. Just be aware.<br /><br />Updated 1/1/11: We ate some of these last night, trying the Galliano, the Cointreau, the Grand Marnier, and the Malibu Caribbean Rum. The foil on the bottles looks great and is easy to remove without looking cheap. Tiny and adorable. The bottles are made with a very smooth and delicious dark chocolate which I really enjoyed, almost needed some milk to wash that down. I spilled just a little of the liquor when I got to that part of the bottle, but my husband didn't spill anything, so it's not a constant. I loved the Galliano and Grand Marnier chocolates; the flavors of the liqueurs went great with the chocolate and the Galliano was only a little boozy. My husband liked the Malibu Caribbean Rum, but found the Cointreau to be a bit too strongly boozy for his tastes.<br /><br />Love these, would absolutely buy again."
Carbquick,"Great way to enjoy pizza on a low carb diet.  We even put a little bit of sauce over the ricotta cheese (there are plenty of low carb spag sauces in the grocery store). I also bake the crust for about 5 minutes before I put everything else on and then bake it again, otherwise the crust does not get cooked enough."
As expected,"This product was exactly as I expected.  The two bags came individually vacuum-sealed with resealable pouch for convenience.  I bought these as a health boost to my daily diet.  They are not the tastiest seeds in the world but if eaten with raisins, I find they take on an almost almond flavor.  This was the best value I saw for these seeds."
My Honest Vine Review,"Of a family of five, nobody really likes it.  To me, the taste is bland.  My sons claim it is just colored mayonnaise.  I really cannot recommend anybody buy it because it has sat in my refrigerator uneaten for awhile now and I suspect it is going to go bad before we ever eat it.  Maybe it is an acquired taste or some others might like it, but it is definitely a no-go for our family."
Fantastic,"This is the best cold tea I've ever had. It really works and has a great flavor. It gets rid of your cough and makes your throat feel better. I have strep right now, and this stuff works better than dayquil and doesn't have any side effects."
excelent purchase,I chose this brand of nut bag based on the other reviews.  I am glad I got the 2 quart size since it leaves plenty of room to squeeze out the milk without having it overflow the bag.  I have been using it to make almond milk from my Vitamix. The milk is so creamy it is perfect for coffee and cereal.
Chewie,My dog loves these! They're the best chewie he has. Perfect for car trips in his crate.
Great cat food!,"My cats are picky.  They will not eat wet cat food if it's grilled, diced, or sliced.  It has to be the classic cat food ""mush"" and it can't contain tuna.  Luckily, they love Blue Buffalo chicken and turkey, as well as their salmon variety.  Great product!"
Messy!,"I expected cat treats would be bite-sized morsels I could hand out a nibble at a time. Instead this package has three oblong slabs sealed in liquid that has to be refrigerated after opening. Yummy, but messy!<br /><br />The price is very high for four ounces of tuna. As treats aren't meant to be a cat's primary food source, just as a treat, it would be more economical to give the kitty a bit of your own people-tuna.<br /><br />The package is labeled ""Product of Ecuador."" Take that for what you will. Doing a search on ""tuna from Ecuador"" gave some moderately disturbing results as regards mercury and fishing practices. The package does say it is from eco-safe, sustainable, dolphin-friendly fisherman, however."
Coffee Pods for Senseo,Great product at reasonable price; hope to find it again at an evern better price.
Glutino crackers - decent alternative,Great taste for a glutin-free alternative. Still have some of the symptoms w/this as I do w/foods made from wheat flour. :(
WOW,"These are really really good cookies!  Great packaging as not one was broken!  About the size of a silver dollar - so a little small - but that means you can have two! A very pleasant surprise - good cookies, good price!"
"great tea, great price","I've been drinking this tea for years. It's the best on the market for a reasonable price.<br /><br />Since I drink a lot of this tea, I've always tried to buy this larger sized package to save a bit of money. But the larger size is not sold in very many places, so I end up buying the smaller size for what feels like too much money - plus I just have to buy a lot of them.<br /><br />Now I've hit upon the perfect formula: buy these larger boxes in bulk at super low prices on a regular basis. I was just reminded of what a great deal this is because I'm on vacation and had to buy the smaller packages here - for a package of 20, I paid almost what I pay here for 50.<br /><br />If you drink a lot of tea, you can go wrong here."
Perfect Snack-mostly apples,"These are the perfect size and the fruit is delicious, the only drawback is that the contents are mostly apples, some only have 1-2 blueberries per package and 4-6 strawberry pieces. The apples are very good but are a little bit ""sharp"" if you are thinking these would good toddler snacks."
Not a bad candy,"This candy tasted good. A real honey flavor. The ingredients don't state much honey though, mainly sugar. I liked knowing I was getting 33% of a few vitamins while eating it. I cannot feel any extra energy, but then who feels something when they take a vitamin? I'll tell you who, someone who should be seeing a doctor not eating candy. I take this candy after a meal so I can absorb the vitamins better. Vitamin C and B6, B12 can be taken at higher doses without side effects, so If I take a multivitamin at diner time on top of this, It won't be overkill. While the product stated pack of 24. I only got 1 pack. This is not a reflection on the product, but it may be a reflection of the ordering process of this product."
Still Good,"I liked this product better when it was all in one package, but it is still good (tasty) even though it is split into two smaller portions."
Great Tasting,"This Taco Bell Chipotle sauce is quite enjoyable and has the tangy yet not very spicy taste you would expect. I have used it on burritos and as a dip. There is no question that if you like the flavor of Chipotle sauce you will enjoy this. But it is high in calories which I expected and did not mind for you do not need a lot too enjoy the flavor.<br /><br />Yet two tablespoons of this sauce contains 100 calories from fat and a total of 110 calories per serving size. The serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons. It taste great just be aware of its high fat content and calories. When serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high. And even so, I would get this product again."
The only Papad to buy.,"We stumbled upon these on Amazon after our local Indian restaurant closed.  They are the same as we used to get when eating out.  They used to call them ""papadoms"".  This is a big quantity (20 packages of about 12 to 15 or so in each) but we freeze them, so they last a long, long time.  Amazon's price is less than $1.40 a package, which is a bargain.<br /><br />The restaurant would cook them in a hot broiler and occasionally deep-fry them, but I like them best microwaved.  Only about 20 seconds or so on each side, until they bubble and get crispy.  If there are any flat or uncooked areas, microwave them again for another 10 seconds or so.<br /><br />Black pepper style is the best and has a little zip to it, we often eat them with salsa, (like a tortilla-chip).<br />Great with a cold beer."
These taste so good!,"I love this coffee. It is wonderful, smoothe and just tastes great! I first tried it locally and loved it. Then, my store no longer planned to carry it so I bought all they had. When I found it on Amazon it was delightful. This is my coffee treat and the rest of the time it is hazelnut coffee, not capuccino."
not bad,"My dogs like this treat pretty well.  They are a little on the dry side, but I have bought other treats that were also dry and they seem to like these better.  I would buy them again."
Love these,"My dogs love these !!  When I ran out of them recently, they were ""counter"" sniffing trying to find some.  I have a service dog that has to maintain his weight, and these are perfect for him."
Just OK,"I have always seen this item in the coffee section of my local market so I assumed it was coffee based. After trying it several times it certainly tasted to me like a malty hot chocolate drink. The ingredient lists ""instant coffee"" and no chocolate so it is coffee after all - I was fooled.<br />  I found the taste overly sweet. The item could of used more of the bitterness of the coffee to tone down the sweetness. Nonetheless the item was a pleasant drink on a cold day but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Good, but not as good as Chicken.","I think this is a good product, but my cats do not like it as much as the chicken flavor.  But otherwise, Liv-a-Littles are a hit."
Goodbye Henry. You will be missed.  :(,"I have been a loyal fan of SBC since it was Stewart Brothers Coffee waaay back. For the longest time Henry's Blend has been a staple in our home. Unfortunately, since corporate brass decided that a good thing needed changing, this replacement doesn't do Henry justice. We gave Level 4 a try and disliked it from the start. After going back and buying an original Henry's Blend and pouring coffee grounds out side by side next to the Level 4, there was a noticeable difference in color, texture and aroma. Sad to say, but I will have to find another roaster of our beloved beans.<br />After hearing other stories like this with the other Levels and the disappearace of trusted blends, it makes me wonder if corporate is purposely trying to kill off SBC or create a media fiasco like Coca-Cola did with ""New Coke"" in the 80's. Who knows.<br />Goodbye Henry. You will be missed.  :("
I got this for a diet i tried,"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!"
Best deal EVER,I am in Alaska and my dog's food was no where to be found.<br />I was able to get it from Amazon with free shipping.  TO ALASKA!!<br />It arrived in a very timely manner and even the postal clerk was shocked that I could buy dog food like this with FREE shipping.<br />I am VERY pleased.<br />My dog LOVES blue Buffalo and I did not want to change her food so I am VERY pleased that I was able to get it.<br />I give you a five star plus!!!!!
This food rocks for our pooches!,"We've been using Wellness CORE Grain-free (original) dry dog food for several years and it really shows! We began a grain free diet with one of our dogs about 15 years ago due to seasonal allergies (the vet had actually recommended going grain free). There are other really great brands of grain free out there, however, we've just stayed with Wellness CORE because it works. We get so many compliments one how our dogs have super soft, shiny coats and their eyes are clear and bright. They love their CORE and we only feed them dry. It is so worth the extra cost to feed a high quality dog food ~ grain free or not. Their bellies are full with great food ~ no additives, by products, etc. Both dogs that we originally started on CORE have since passed...but lived to the ripe old age of 17 and 19. Hopefully, our two current dogs (7 years and 9 months) will do the same! Highly recommend this food."
Yummy!,"This is GREAT tea! I have not tried it as ""iced"" tea yet, but it's great hot. For those who are interested, my local (Denver) Safeway just started stocking both the Good Earth teas and coffee. Last Saturday (11-22-08) there was a woman handing out samples and coupons, and the tea was ""buy one, get one free"". What a deal!"
Yumm-O!,"I love the taste of this.  It's the only tea that I've been able to drink without honey.  The lingering blueberry flavor is delicious!  I'm not sold on it as an appetite suppressant though.  That effect doesn't really come till after the second cup of tea, and there are just other things I'd rather be drinking.  Still, it's a very delighful green tea."
Dry gritty and has to be refrigerated after opened,Poor product don't waste your money
Good Food.,"I take these with me hiking and camping all the time. It gives me good energy without the nasty corn sryup. Very tasty, and clean whole food. Dates, Almonds, Apples, Walnuts, Raisins, and Cinnamon, whats not to like?. Toss 3-4 of these in my day pack, Along with a lunch and plenty of water, and I'm good for the day."
Great as a baby shower party favor!,Exactly what I wanted...individual packages of cookies that I couldn't find at a store.  Shipping was only 99cents and came to be in about 3 days.<br /><br />It was great!
It's growing on me,"At last a nutritional drink I can handle, no sugar or other terrible stuff. At first I thought it wasn't quite sweet enough, but changed my mind. I got this on subscription, to be sent every 3 months, just increased to monthly. Good stuff."
My favorite herbal tea,"I'm so glad this is available year-round now. It is a peppermint spice tea, just the right amount of cinnamon and spice to make the peppermint more interesting. I never get tired of this tea."
Now that i feel much better without worrying about any synthetic chemicals :-),"Definitely, send to my parents! A great deal and so yummy! Love whomever whatever companies that care for our health :-)"
Not my favorite,"I'm not a granola expert of fanatic, but I thought I might enjoy this product more because I like blueberry and vanilla.<br /><br />When I opened it, it smelled musty, like a year-old box of cereal.  I found that very odd, but plunged ahead anyway.  It was disappointing, because I picked up on pretty much no blueberry flavor (or blueberries, for that matter).  It tasted like really dense granola.  From a pure flavor and eating enjoyment aspect, I did not really care for it.<br /><br />From a health standpoint, this product is free of everything ""bad"" and full of ""good stuff""...heavy on flax.  I'm not a health food fanatic, so again, this was lost on me.  But my son, age 24, really seemed to enjoy it.  He's much more attentive to what he consumes, and I think he liked the taste as well.  He ended up being the only consumer of this product.  (My wife liked it less than me.)<br /><br />I have to conclude, based on the non-scientific study of my family, that this product appeals to folks accustomed to more ""healthy"" snack foods...and not folks like me who have no problem with more ""commercial, processed"" snacks.  I had hoped that KIND would be both tasty and healthy...but it fell short.  I'd be a two-star reviewer...my son would be 4...so I'm splitting the difference."
Very Good,"Foie Gras is best whole but this is a good alternative. I prefer to just slice and eat as an appetizer, its just a nice delicacy."
yummy yummy,the smell is heavenly to say the least..used it in many recipes and ate it as is as well...DELICIOUS:)
Second batch inferior to first,"My son drinks gallons of green tea.  We ordered one of the three-packs in the fall, and it was really good.  He was so impressed, we ordered it again. That (second) batch was disappointing - not nearly as full-flavored as the first.  I'm ordering it just one more time, hoping that the poorer quality was a fluke."
Disappointing,"Not only did these cookies taste even remotely chocolately, they didn't taste very hazelnutty either. Worst of all they are way too sweet and really only taste of honey (a surprise to me, a total sweets-lover). That honey turns out to be the first ingredient also makes me doubt how paleo/""healthy"" they really are... I prefer raw revolution bars (or even a handful of hazelnuts and dark chocolate chips!)."
great flaovr,"This coffee has a great robust flavor and is a great pick-me-up.  I tried it as soon as I opened it and was very pleased with the flavor of this coffee.  Buy it, you will enjoy it."
Great Taste & Healthy,Great snack to curb your appetite or replace a meal with if your trying to lose weight.
Corgi Cocaine,We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!
Very good tea!,"This my absolute favorite flavor of tea ever! The lavender adds a burst of fragrance and a subtle hint of sweetness which softens typically harsh earl grey tea. Excellent tea, very mild."
tangy and tasty,Love this sauce! It makes our chicken finger lickin' good. I'm happy serving it to my family knowing that it is local and organic. Highly recommend it.
It got me through Christmas!,"I have had mild IBS all of my adult life...  I drink this tea all day and it has eliminated the bloated feeling and gas.  It is the ONLY thing that got me through Christmas. With all the holiday foods around, it allowed me to indulge a little and survive without having to ""pay the piper"". It is certainly an acquired taste, which you might not like if you do not favor licorice.  It really helps bloating if you use it on a regular basis even if you don't have IBS..."
What is that Burning Rubber smell?,"When brewing these Kahlua K-cups it seriously smells like burning rubber.  Once you have your coffee brewed and away from the burning rubber smell it is okay tasting.  I won't buy these again because of that smell that comes out when brewing, it is really horrible and messes with your kitchen for a while."
Healthy & Delicious Potato Chips,"Oh, these chips are wonderful. They are not greasy, have a very satisfying crunch and although they are formed chips, they taste like actual potato chips. Only one grocery store in my area carries these chips and they are frequently out of stock, even at $3 a bag. Worse, even when in stock, I am lucky to find more than a few bags at a time in the store. I hate making the special trip just for the chips, particularly when I often find the shelf empty. Problem solved -- Amazon's are much more reasonably priced and I can stock up -- and this snack is as close in flavor to actual potato chips that I've found to date."
"With a few modifications to prep directions, these were pretty good.","This is fairly easy to fix.  Soak it in warm water for a minute, then stir fry with veggies and oil.  Doing it that way, I found it way too dry (a lot like straw), but after adding a cup of water, they softened up (although a bit too much).  If I try these again, I'll add a bit less water.<br /><br />While these noodles lacked much taste of their own, They nicely soaked up the flavor of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041CIP3M"">Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit</a>.  I fixed the Rendang according to package directions, then this bag of vermicelli, then I mixed it all together.  It made for a tasty dish.  While these weren't quite as firm as wheat pasta, it served its purposed quite nicely.<br /><br />I like that this pasta is healthy, and that it doesn't have gluten is a plus for those with gluten intolerance."
"Ah,  Dilmah!","This made my morning to find Dilmah for sale on Amazon.  I have struggled to find Dilmah ever since I fell under the spell of its charm and quality and tastiness in New Zealand about six years ago.  I have ordered it imported from Dilmah, I have gone back to NZ and enjoyed it every day, and I have gotten it as a gift from a Canadian friend, but now I can easily have my own sure supply.  A truly great tea!"
"Not much to look at, but taste is great.","When I first opened the individual package I was a bit grossed out honestly. It looked like a candybar-shaped turd.<br /><br />But then I ate it, and the texture wasn't that great either so I was still grossed out with the image of the turd, but kept eating it. To my great relief it tasted really nice. There is a lot of flavor for how few of ingredients there are.<br /><br />Also, I really liked the minimalistic ingredient list. My advice, just don't look at it when you eat it."
Robsmom,"These popchips(original flavor)are great tasting, low in fat, and a snack that is satisfying. With free shipping and handling with amazon prime they are now at a price I will order and reorder.  With my son's food allergies I am so happy they contain all allowable ingredients!!  Thanks Amazon."
Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!,This fudge is so good and very easy to make.  Takes about 5-10 min. total.  I highly recommend it.  Great price too.
Not worth buying on Amazon!!!!!!!!,"Everytime I get this shipment delivered, the cans are broken and the food leaked out and there are bugs everywhere. I have to throw away part of the the shipment and go through the disgust and hassle of cleaning it up. This is the third shipment we received like this (I had one shipment damaged and had the shipments on automatic renew each month and the last shipments were damaged too) and I am fed up. I posted a comment to the seller about this after the frst shipment and never received a response and the problem keeps happening. SO NOT WORTH IT and I AM VERY UNHAPPY!!!! I am going to the local Walmart to get it there is not much of a difference in price and at least I know I am not getting bugs shipped to my home and having to throw out cans that are damaged. I cancelled my future shipments and DO NOT recommend anyone order this product from Amazon."
Good morning coffee,Great coffee to start your day. We are repeat customers and the 50 count box meets our needs to reduce waste.
Tastes like i didn't change the kcup from the last cup,"Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I didn't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. Weak coffee, flavor didn't appeal to me either. Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. Wolfgang's vienna roast was pleasant though."
Our shiba inu loves this!,We've originally bought this as our dog's first food and then switched to Wellness. Dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to Newman's own and now our dog feels a lot better. Never switched his food ever again.
"SWEET RETREAT NATURALS ROASTED ALMONDS WITH MILK CHOCOLATE, APPLE","I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON WHO VISITS WEEKLY.  HOWEVER, THE CANDY BOX LOOKED SO APPEALING SO I ALLOWED MYSELF 2 PIECES (LOOKS LIKE XL PEANUT m&m) DAILY.  VERY GOOD TREAT AND AFTER THE SECOND DAY I GAVE UP AND ATE ALL THE REST.  OH MY...GUESS MY REVIEW SAYS I LIKE THE PRODUCT. DONT THINK IT WAS WORTH 2.00+ FOR THE BOX THO."
Three 14-week-old kitties,"Firstly, this is WAY too expensive here on Amazon. My local mom-and-pop pet store has this for $17 for the 7 lb. bag.  I regret getting this here, as I feel a bit ripped off. Two of my kittens are doing fine, but the third is having some major diarrhea, and after doing some research, I suspect it is this food. I am in the process of figuring it out what exactly is the issue. Besides from the Amazon price, and my one sick cat, this food is great. High quality ingredients, and kitties seem to like it!<br /><br />UPDATE 8/18/2012: I believe it was this food that was causing my little kitty to slide into first, where she then proceeded to feel a'something burst. She stopped having issues once we switched to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X49XC"">Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Formula, 15 Pound Bag</a>. Also, I gave her a squirt of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8WOC"">Nutri-Vet Probiotics with Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil for Cats, 4-Ounce</a> down her throat, and sprinkled it on her new food. Using the probiotics was probably part of why she got better, but I also really think getting her off the Blue Buffalo helped. Kitty is now slid'n into home WITHOUT feelin' something foam!<br /><br />I am still keeping this review at 4 stars because I know this is a great product, and my little one was just overly sensitive."
Jack Links  Teryiaki Beef Steak Nuggets,"The beef nuggets are soft and easy on the teeth and tasty. If they are slightly less salty, they will be excellent.Very good snack.<br />Johnson"
Excellent Product,"Great taste, great value, like how the containers fit in cabinets and has easy access, the flavor is what will continue to keep me coming back"
Pilon Gourmet espresso coffee: Good stuff!!,"This coffee allows for a nice cup of java and seems to get a bit more crema than my old brand. It has a rich flavor, but not as bold as I hoped it would be. The price is good and delivery was fast using Amazon. Don't be afraid to use a bit more than normal, and tamp it well. As always, hot milk is the way to go . . . 2% is fine."
Great Oatmeal,"I have been eating oatmeal on and off for the last ten years and recently I have found myself enjoying a nice hot bowl for breakfast, especially because its winter. I was first introduced to John McCann's Oatmeal when I decided to quit eating rolled oats because of their texture and the inspiration of watching the episode of ""GOOD EATS"" featuring steel cut or pinhead or Irish oats. I originally found these oats at my local market and found them to be delicious, although, they do take awhile to properly cook they are by far the best option in terms of flavor, nutrition and texture. Their flavor is similar to brown rice while still having a bit of a ""wheaty"" taste. They are very nutritious, but as most nutritious foods are, they must be portioned because of their high calorie content, (I find that half a cup, 300 calories, is the perfect amount) although they are very good for fighting cholesterol and the fat they contain is ""good"" fat. Their texture is also similar to brown rice, but softer and creamier if prepared in such a fashion. I make my oats two ways, on the weekdays I make them in a rice cooker overnight which produces a piping hot bowl of deliciousness and on the weekends I take my time and prepare them on the stove top. They really are a delicious way to start my day and I look forward to enjoying a bowl every morning. Being that I eat pinhead oats everyday I found that buying these tins was beginning to get quite expensive, so one day I went to a bulk foods market and bought a pound of bulk steel cut oats thinking they would be a lower quality and good for the weekdays. Since then I have done numerous side-by-side comparisons of the two and they are exactly the same in taste and texture, making paying double for John McCann's Oats a delicious, but obsolete choice nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros: Delicious, nutritious, and the tin is re usable.<br />Cons: Somewhat expensive when compared to bulk options.<br />Overall: Buy these if you aren't going to be eating them everyday; they are delicious and well worth the money.<br /><br />I cook my steel cut oats on the stove top thusly:<br />1/2 cup steel cut oats<br />1 tbsp unsalted butter<br />2 cup water (boiling)<br />1/2 cup milk<br />1 pinch of kosher salt<br />2 tsp sweetener (brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup)<br /><br />Take a 12"" sauce pan (or something comparable) with a lid and turn heat to medium, add butter, let melt and add oats. The idea here is to roast the oats. Be sure to shake the pan around every minute or so to keep the oats from burning. After about three to four minutes or until the oats smell toasty add the boiling water and drop the heat to low and cover. Let sit for thirty minutes and slowly stir the oats every five minutes until done. After thirty minutes has elapsed add milk, salt and sweetener stir until combined (If a more creamy mixture is desired add more milk or cream to oats). Serve hot and enjoy."
Great for gym rats..,"This product is pretty good. With 26 or 27 grams of protien and low in fat, it is great for gym enthusiasts or people who want to stay healthy by eating healthy. I personally am a body builder and I'm looking to eat as much protien as possible everday. I definatly noticed an upgrade in performance in the gym and during the day when I take this. Although the cajun flavor is a tade too spicy for me at times. Like my eyes will get red and my nose will start to run. Other than that it is delicous. I will probably try the Teriyaki next."
Yummy,"As a borderline diabetic, I can satisfy the chocolate cravings without guilt.  These bars are tasty.  I have subscribed to all the flavors, but chocolate is my favorite.  These are not dry, but instead, live up to their fudge name.<br /><br />I take a bar to work for breakfast and surprisingly it keeps me satisfied until lunch.  At first, I was doubtful a little bar could do that, but these bars succeed.  Every time I unwrap a bar and take that first bite, my thought is, ""These are GOOD FOR ME???"".<br /><br />I recommend trying these if you are diabetic, borderline diabetic, or just want something healthy and tasty to snack on."
"Great aroma, needs stronger coffee flavor","I have shared all three Senseo flavored coffees with several people at work. Everyone loves the smell of the coffees but many of us would prefer a stronger coffee flavor.<br /><br />Overall, it is nice to be able to offer a choice of flavors to people visiting my office and the convenience can't be beat. My personal favorite is still the dark roast."
$8.00 Per Box!?,"I love Nabisco Grahams, but according to this ad, each 14 ounce box is over $8.00.<br />Are you freaking kidding me?!"
"I like it, anyway","I think this tastes delicious.  My 8-month old is not so sure.  I think he isn't crazy about the texture.<br /><br />I'm hoping he gets more adventurous eventually and starts to like this.  But if your baby isn't into food that is more of a mashed consistency than a puree, they're probably not going to be thrilled with this one."
very weak!,"don't bother! bet you couldn't tell the difference between this and hot water if your eyes were closed. well, maybe the water would have a taste!"
Keurig Coffee Lovers,I used to buy these coffee beans in the 3 lb bag till I got my Keurig coffee maker. The freshness of this coffee is amazing no longer need to grind my own beans. I put these pods in a clear canister next to my Keurig. Really a great product.
Not super fresh,"This coriander was 'okay' but not as fresh and as aromatic as I'd hoped. Also, the best by date was only for July 2012 which would give me only an optimal window of around four months, but, I went ahead and vacuum packed half of it and stored it in my pantry which will hopefully extend the shelf-life.<br /><br />That said, I love coriander and this is a decent quality if not optimally fresh."
Awesome pistaschios,Amazing price for great quality pistachios. Someone said something about them being tiny but that is not the case at all. They are normal size I would say. You can definitely tell that they are not salted but it's not a bad thing. I taste more of the pistachios and don't miss the salt at all. Will probably buy again when I run out.
Popchips,Individual popchips are a great snack!  They are only 3pts. per bag on the new Weight Watchers Plus program.  They are a quick snack & they make your head happy!!!!
Small but sweet,"I was nervous about buying such a small container, but it turned out to be so sweet that it really was a good deal.  The vanilla is very good, too.  My two-year-old son calls his water sippy ""cake sippy"" when we put only a few drops in for nap and bed time."
"Warning: ""Assortment"" is a stretch","Like the writers of many other reviews I read, I got a disproportionately high amount of plain Special K - around 30 of my 60 bowls.  I got no bowls of the Kashi cereal.  The net weight of a bowl of plain Special K is 1.5 oz, whereas the other cereals weigh in at around 2.5 oz.  Special K is also the cheapest cereal to make of the four, making it extremely suspicious that many shipments of this ""assortment"" seem to be unbalanced in its favor.<br /><br />I'm pretty upset that I purchased a ""4-cereal assortment"" that ended up containing only 3, and an undesirable mix of those.  Be warned; based on the reviews here, you're likely to have a similar experience."
Popcorn packages,"Like the popcorn.  Maybe too much salt in the packet, but makes great flavored popcorn.  The butter packet takes a little getting used to taking out of the packet, but tastes great.  Will order more."
good tea,"I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is ""insipid"" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan."
FAST GRASS,"Provider shipped the items to me superfast - thanks! The only downside to this size of the wheatgrass powder is that you should have the small container (from a previous purchase) to use for practical purposes ... otherwise you'll never get your hand down into the container to scoop out what you need.  But for buying in bulk there's no better method I've found.  I've been using the powder for 18 months now and it's so much more convenient than growing wheatgrass, and my naturopath says nothing is lost from having the powder instead of fresh."
Didn't do much for me,"I used it for about 3 weeks. Didn't notice much of a difference in any way. I bought it specifically for seborrheic dermatitis. There was a bit of improvement but not enough. I didn't like the taste much, even with mixing it in with stuff. So I won't be buying again."
A dark dream of a product,"Can't say enough good things about this Cocoa. Have used it in cakes, breads, chilies - deep, dark, delicious. When it arrived I though a pound was a ridiculous amount to own. Now I find myself looking for excuses to cook with it and about to order another."
Bad buy,"Sure, it does what it says it will do. But!!...<br />it's made of very cheap materials and it's over-priced. The plastic is so cheap that it warps after you use the machine a couple of times, and the lid will never again fit properly. So, be prepared to get splattered with baby food each time you puree. If it saves time by being an all-in-one machine, it kills more time by requiring a complete dismantling of the bowl (5 parts need to be separated from each other and washed separately EACH TIME YOU USE IT!). When I read other reviews about mold growing in the reservoir, that just did it for me. I packed it up and returned it. Worst purchase and waste of time ever."
"Tastes great, less filling, no aftertaste","Briefly:<br /><br />- taste is VERY close to sugar's<br />- no aftertaste<br />- no known adverse side effects<br />- one packet is the equivalent of two teaspoons of sugar<br />- zero calories<br /><br />I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy the larger boxes and save :).<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time."
BEST Organic Dog Food Ever!,"If you're on the fence about whether to try this food out for your dog or not, please do both of you a favor and get this food!  This is by far, the BEST dog food I have come across and I have been telling everyone who cares about their dog(s) to get this food for their own dogs.<br /><br />For years, my dog had been having issues with dog food in general, and was diagnosed as having a 'sensitive stomach' which is when I began my quest into dog food research.  Added to this was the dog food recall scare from a couple years ago and I started looking into healthier alternatives for dog food.  First and foremost, I found that about 90 percent of dog food that had been drilled into our heads as being 'good' and 'healthy' for my dog was in fact the exact opposite. Bad food filled with bad things and bad by-products and fillers.  In other words, I had been feeding my poor dog 'junk food' for years and I felt horrible once I discovered the truth about dog food.<br /><br />My dog had been having issues with soft stools, etc. and was not doing well. After several expensive visits to the vet to rule out any serious medical conditions (which they were not going to rule out unless I spent more $$ on more tests to determine this), I decided to start with the food.  I did a ton of research online and came upon this food and decided to give it a try.  I was looking specifically for Organic, Healthy Food made 100 percent in the USA so I would not have to worry about miscellaneous ingredients making their way into my dogs' food (like with the big brand names), which is when I came across Organix Dog Food. Not only did they fit all of my requirements, they went a step further with the Fiber Content in their food.  I learned that most other dog foods had a fiber content of between 1-3 percent making them very low in fiber.  Then I discovered that to be healthy for dogs, they needed a fiber content of 5 percent or higher, which I found out this food had!  Score!<br /><br />I bought this food with all of this in mind and my dog and I have not been disappointed. My dog now loves to eat his Organix dog food, he now has NORMAL stools and he no longer has to go in to the vet for more expensive medical tests.  I can honestly say, this food has been the BEST for him and I am very grateful to have found it.  If your dogs are having similar problems, please give this food a try and I bet you too will be pleasantly surprised.  Thing is, when you switch ANY dogs' food, you have to do so gradually, over about a week or so with their old dog food and the new food until you fully switch them over to the new food.  That said, expect good results at the end of that transition, once they are 100 percent transferred onto this new food.<br /><br />The main reason I wanted to leave this review on here was to help other dog owners out there who are looking for healthier alternatives to their dogs' current food, so their dogs can live healthier, happier lives as well.  Best of luck to you and your dog(s)!"
delicious dessert tea,"This is my favorite tea ever, I drink it daily iced. It has a nutty rich flavor almost like a coffee. I used to drink Celestial Seasonings Dessert Teas but as usual another company has discontinued the products. I originally ordered a cse of this from Stash last year and was hooked and hopefully they won't take it off the market. It seems like all that's out there is fruit flavored teas, which I don;t like, so if you like a rich bakery flavor tea, this one is it."
One issue,"I know this is not rocket science here, but when you follow the directions to set your microwave to 4 minutes and wait for the popping to stop for two seconds, ya better stop cooking or the popcorn will burn. But it leaves many non popped kernels in the bottom of my popcorn bowl. It leaves you beside yourself, cook longer and get more, however burnt, popped popcorn. Your mileage may vary...."
DIFFERENT THAN SLIM JIM;S,"EASIER TO CHEW, MILDER FLAVOR . I THINK LESS EXPENSIVE. MY KIT LIKES THEM TOO."
Just OK,I purchased this coffee with high hopes for a sweet light roast.  It is ok but has a strong coffee taste I did not expect. I recommend Gloria Jeans Macadamia Cookie for anyone who want a sweet light coffee.
Great product!,I bought this for my parents as a  Christmas present and they love it. They have an apartment over my garage and have limited space so this one was perfect. It is quite heavy and well made.
Too many throw-aways,"Good tasting pistachios, but I had to throw away too many unopened or difficult to open nuts.<br />I'll stick with the Wonderful brand."
Hardcore Dairy Man,"I've been eating ice cream for over 50 years, and the thought of non-dairy ""ice cream"" didn't appeal to me, until I tried your product... Amazing! How in the world did you get a nut-based non-dairy product to taste like ice cream? I followed the directions on the label and let the Ice Supreme sit a while at room temperature, and get ""spoon soft,"" Fabulous! As I get older, I'm paying more attention to what I put into my body, and it's a joy to read an ingredient label that does not have the multi-syllable additives, preservatives, and other hard to pronounce chemicals. Just old fashion all natural ingredients like grandma would use. Thanks for such a great product, my favorite being ""Pecan Passion."" The whole pecans on top are like a gift. Thanks again."
Jolly Rancher Sugar Free,"This is the best sugar free candy on the market, hands down! There is no after taste, which is very important to me. Well worth the money. I've tried many other sugar free candy and none of them come close to this one, but don't take my word for it, try it for yourself and you'll see."
Rating Plain and Chocolate,"This is the milk we buy now. The product has a good fresh flavor and the packaging is easy to open and does not leak when the straw is inserted. We have the plain and chocolate on subscribe and save, but sometimes the best by date is within a couple of months. We drink it before then, but wanted to put that out there for those looking for long term storage of this product."
My cat won't eat them!,"My cat won't eat them! She first was somewhat interested and sniffed them, then she licked them, but then she abandoned them. I cannot get her to eat them. Which is a shame, because they would be so healthy for her teeth. I would be willing to pay the price, but not if she won't eat them!"
"Unusual, delicate yet flavorful.  I began developing cravings for it!","This is the perfect tea for breakfast or any time of the day. Numi's Yunnan Black tea has a distinctive aroma with a strong apricot top-note fortified by a nice oaky, grassy base. The brewed tea flavor is clean and yet complex, slightly rich. There is a an very slight edge of tannin which perfectly contrasts the subtle woodsy and floral flavors. Excellent with a dash of cream. Unfortunately Numi does not list the amount of caffeine it contains on the box. It appears to have less caffeine than the usual English breakfast from its effect on this taster.<br /><br />Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or ""natural flavorings""."
Sensational taste,"I have to admit, I was a bit leary to spend 15.86 on a 16 oz jar of raw almond butter, but I am so pleased that I did. This Artisana 100% raw organic almond butter is delicous! It is very dense and packed with flavor. A serving size is 2 TBSP and there are 14 servings per jar. That provides 187 calories, 16g fat, 6 carbs, 4g fiber, and 7 g protein. I usually try to just have 1 tbsp as a serving though its so good, thats hard to do. I've tasted a lot of almond butter over the years and have even made my own in the vitamix (which is a pain to clean up) and this is the best tasting yet. Highly recommend."
Great grits,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL6KM"">Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Corn Grits, 24 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> These are not only delicious, but very quick to cook!  And they are organic!"
"Rich, Robust Flavor, and other good stuff, too.","The following are quotes from the box of Marley Coffee 15 Count Single Serve Pods:<br /><br />""Ethically Farmed. Artisan Roasted. Exotic floral and berry flavor. Small batch roasted. Fair Trade Certified. USDA approved.""<br /><br />So far, that's all good.  Now for the real test. How does it taste? What's the aroma like?<br /><br />For the coffee lovers in our house (everyone), this coffee got five stars on both those counts.<br /><br />The aroma is rich and strong, and gets you moving toward the kitchen in the morning (if someone else has brewed the coffee, of course :>)<br /><br />The taste is robust and full-bodied, providing that perfect morning coffee fix so many of us need.<br /><br />Though I didn't detect any ""floral"" or ""berry"" notes, I did notice that there was a nice smoothness, and no bitterness.<br /><br />Overall, this coffee is good stuff, from the way it is farmed to the way it tastes. Recommended!"
Don't Mess With A Good Chili Recipe!,"McCormick's time-tested chili recipe is simple and delicious, mostly due to this chili mix. There's no downside at all. The recipe is simple, the ingredients are inexpensive, and the results are sure to please. This chili actually seems to get better on the second or third day after making it. Despite the fact that most of the ingredients come in cans (and this packet comes in... well... a packet), when you combine them you get fresh, hot, bubbling chili on the stove.<br /><br />These bulk packs of McCormick Chili Seasoning offer a great deal, especially because you'll probably want to double or triple the recipe. I actually made six batches at once, and it lasted us a long time.<br /><br />If you buy this chili mix and the other ingredients in large quantities, you can make a LOT of delicious food at a surprisingly low price per bowl."
Not everlasting--not even close,"Within 15 minutes, Maggie Mousse, my one-year-old labradoodle, consumed the treat and pulled off chunks of the treat ball.  Perhaps she was too young for this toy?  The blue material though does not seem strong enough to withstand even rather gentle gnawing.  I've wasted my money yet again on an ""indestructible"" toy for Miss Mousse."
Love this But.....,"I love this product, but I live in Alaska and I hate the fact that they won't ship here!"
Sampo Loves Them!,"A lab can be a bottomless pit; so I thought these would be a good way to make sure his digestion stays healthy. After a couple days I'd given him about three of these, when he suddenly started puking everywhere, little white bits of rawhide, and he couldn't keep anything down. I was so worried that something in these treats was to blame, until we realzied he'd dug up some rhododendron root and that was likely causing his digestion problems, as it is quite poisonous. A can of pumpkin pie filling and some TLC later, and he happily chews on these treats without a problem. So not a cure for landscape plant poisoning, but still a tasty chew treat for your mutt!"
"I only buy U.S. ""grown"" maple syrup!","I ordered this particular brand of maple syrup for a variety of reasons: 1. It's organic.  2. It's NOT Canadian!! Our family boycotts any products from Canada until that country discontinues bludgeoning baby seals to death for their fur. 3. It is grown & manufactured by a family farm that follows sound ecological standards.  So, when I received the syrup, I was totally happy that all the above was true plus it tastes great!  Not as thick as other brands, and that's OK. I highly recommend this product, and urge readers to support family farms, organically grown (mainly for environmental reasons), and to think about whose economy is being supported by your purchases.  Not to preach or anything!"
Great Cat Treat,"I ordered these Whiskas Dentabites for an 8-month old kitten we adopted.  The cat was in good health, but his breath was a little stinky.  One bag of these treats plus a carefully balanced diet was it took to clear up that breath.  I ordered the 12-pack and plan to re-order when we run low."
Fake Chocolate,"I thought we would give it a try.  It was a good deal, but the fake chocolate has a bitter taste.  We prefer the regular Rice Chex."
My dog loves these,The 21 ounce Pro-Treat Beef Liver Treats are a great value and my dog loves them.  I just need to reach for the tub and she will sit and put up her paw.  I even cut them into tiny pieces sometimes and sprinkle them onto her food.  She gobbles up her food when I do that.  This size will last a while.
BPA in the lid?,"I like their variety package, but also heard that there is BPA in the lid. I will switch to other BPA free products."
Perfect as an occasional supplement!,"My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as ""inspected for human consumption"". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above."
Low-Cal Margarita???  Greatness!,I'm not sure what the people expect who do not like this product.  I use this as well as the OTB 0 calorie mix you can buy at grocery store and I think they are both great.  I love the margarita but had all the calories.  Give it a try and you will not be sorry!
The only trap I've found that has worked for me!,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 5:25 Mins<br /><br /></span>This is the way I've had luck using this type of trap. I've killed over 35 moles from my yard this way but keep in mind that techniques may vary depending on your area and soil type."
What can you say about M&M's?,"Obviously if you're reading this you've probably already had M&M's - so don't let that stop you from buying this package!  I love the size of this bag because it fills a candy dish that I have out completely with a few left over for me to eat up right away.  They last for a while - though not as long as they should - in my house, but I'll keep ordering them as they are a delicious treat."
AMAZING!,"I never write reviews, but had to on this product. I bought every cat treat ever made and my cats wouldn't touch them. Pretty much gave up, but then tried this one. They can't get enough of this treat. They go crazy for it and love it. Thank you Halo!"
Sweet!,"These are tasty, but a little sweet for me; I couldn't eat more than 2 of these at a time, even if I wanted to.  (Wait - maybe that's a GOOD thing!!)  I purchased these, along with the blueberry flavor, and the blueberry bars are the better choice in my opinion.  Overall, a good option if you're looking to satisfy a sweet craving in a healthy way."
Absolutely great for all your cooking oil needs,"Great oil, love the subtle coconut taste, very healthy for you just do the research on Google, and it makes the best popcorn you can think of. Give it a try. I was hesitant to give it a go since I am not a big fan of coconut as a flavor, but once I tried it I was hooked."
Wonderful decaffeinated alternative. Delicious and a Great value!,"I love this apple cider for a sweet treat without any sugar or guilt.<br />Wonderful in the fall or winter. Much better for me than a real caramel apple or pie.<br />It is a great decaffeinated alternative to tea or coffee and kids love it.<br />It is very sweet, but I use extra water for a larger cup.<br />I have also opened it up and used it to cook with.<br />The mix inside does not brew, just rehydrates, which allows me to use it at work without a Kurieg."
"Forget the redfish, use it on steaks!!","Searched around for the best price, and because I'm a prime member w/ free shipping, the best total price was here at amazon.  I've used this for several years to coat steaks before grilling (adding blue cheese and grilled Portabella mushrooms on the top), and I can say, a better steak can't be found for me.  With two large containers, though, I've gotta find some more uses for this delicious seasoning...."
Worth the price...,"I went to the Godiva store in Bellevue Square near Seattle recently and found this very expensive box of chocolates. I thought my husband would love them but he thought there were too many creamy chocolates (with ganache) and not enough filled with caramel or nuts. I didn't even know he liked expensive chocolates until a few weeks ago so I'm a slow learner in this department. But I can't say I'm not pleased that I'll get to eat most of these chocolates. So far I've tasted three and the Coffee Feather chocolate is a favorite already. I'm looking forward to trying the Strawberry Cheesecake, Open Oyster with hazelnut praline and Cinnamon Blush. There is a little pamphlet with pictures so you can see which chocolates you want to try first. This is a very elegant package of chocolates that most people will enjoy. I'd buy this again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
WONDERFUL,THIS COFFEE IS PERFECT FOR ME. BEFORE I GOT THE K-CUP COFFEE MAKER I ENJOYED STRONG COFFEE.  I TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF K-CUPS AND ALWAYS GO BACK TO THIS ONE.  IT HAS GOOD FLAVOR AND STRENGTH TO SATISFY ME.
All about the taste,"I am sorry to say these cookies did not taste at all like sugar cookies. They were actually salty, and not nice and chewy. The only good thing is that they arrived in one piece, no crumbs. However it did not deliver on the taste. Iw ill no0t be ordering from Scott's items again."
"Okay, but disappointing","Previously bought marzipan potatoes but they were sold out, so tried these. Niederegger marzipan is the best I've ever tasted but the chocolate is overpowering. The potatoes were better because they were pure marzipan and the flavor really comes through."
Cherry Poo,"I love the Fruit & Nut Food bars from Larabar.<br /><br />They are a healthy snack, and unlike many other fruit flavored bars, you can actually taste the dead fruit.<br /><br />I had never tried the Cherry Pie before and they are very good."
My Dog Loves Zuke's Treats,These treats are great for training or if you don't want your dog to have too many calories in their treats. I was buying these at the local pet store and the bags were small and almost as expensive as these 1lb. packs.<br />My dog loves them and will gladly do a trick or two to get her Zuke's.
Both the old and the bold at my house love them,"I wasn't sure exactly how to review cat treats--since I don't have any frame of reference--never having eaten them before. Just kidding.<br /><br />So I have one 17 year old cat who throws up everything and another 7 year old cat that is extremely picky when it comes to anything other than her normal brand of cat food. I was going for the concept that they would eat them and I wouldn't find any surprises on my bed when I got home from work.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough they both loved them (this is rare--they don't even like the same cat food!). I didn't step on any squishy disgusting things (well, except a couple of soggy toasted oat cereal--but that's not my cats--that's my kid).<br /><br />I don't see this replacing regular dental hygiene or vets visits (too bad) but they are a paws up winner at our house!"
caramel apple,"I have to use sugar free items as a result of gastric bypass surgery.  Sugar makes me very sick.  Also, as a result of my surgery I need to intake a lot of protein daily.  I use the sugar free caramel syrup to make one of my protein shakes along with no sugar added frozen applesauce.  It tastes delicious."
Ummmm 16.88 for ONE????,The item Davinci syrups is fantastic! I am a little ....putting it mildly....put off by the price.  At one time this listing and others by the same company were listed at 16.88 (3 pack)
Not for me!,"I used to be a loyal Kraft Catalina customer, but since Kraft decided to change the formula, I will no longer purchase it.  I have been using Marzetti's Honey French which is great (IMHO).<br /><br />PS:  Kraft also seems to be ignoring irate customers on it's forum."
Watery and too sweet,"I gave Oregon Chai a try when my local grocery store didn't have Tazo. Big Mistake! It's somehow watery tasting and too sweet at the same time. And there's no spice. If you're used to Starbucks Chai, which is Tazo, then you won't like this stuff."
"Great, but special?  I'm not so sure.","These Honey Stingers are great.  I've used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour.  They do seem to provide some much-needed energy.  They're easy to chew, taste great, don't stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty, and the packet is small enough to be portable.  I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.  The ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical.  For that reason, I gave them just 4 stars."
the best tea,"This is the best tea I've ever tried! It's very expensive, but so good. Top quality! And it's quite strong if you leave teabag in. I can get 2-3 cups in row (of 1 bag) if I'm thirsty ;)"
Vanilla Pleasure,"It is pretty decent. Those smaller bottles don't seem to last very long, so I went<br />with a larger size. Now I've gotta con the wife into making more cookies and cakes !!!!"
try Schar rolls,"These are coarse, grainy and a poor substitute for the real thing.  I finally found Schar rolls which a cut in-half & toast. Excellent texture & taste! & their smaller size makes for good portion control."
Something Unique,"Lapsang Souchong - 'Russian Caravan' as it is commonly known - is a truly exceptional Chinese tea, and it is done proper justice by the ladies at Culinary Teas. A generous teaspoon of Lapsang Souchong steeped for about three and a half minutes in roughly 190-200 degree water will yield a strong, flavorful cup of the Fujian Province's most notable tea. What is so respectable about Culinary Teas' Lapsang is that it manages to contain immense flavor with very little of the aftertaste common to lower-grade Lapsang Souchong.<br /><br />But how does it TASTE? The answer is both mysteriously complex and blindingly simple. A quick sniff of the pine-needle-roasted leaves brings forth the aroma of a campfire; this flavor carries well into the brewed tea, creating a strong, smokey aroma and flavor that does not fade as the tea cools. Culinary Teas' evenly fired, full-leaf Lapsang Souchong ought to be placed at the top of any tea enthusiast's shelf as the strongest, most impression-making tea in Culinary's collection. One does not forget the first experience with Lapsang. Do it right by using this brand."
Delicious Cookies!!,"These ""Pure Butter Shortbread Fingers"" are wonderful!  They melt in your mouth & are not overly sweet.  Only 4 ingredients:  wheat flour, butter, sugar, salt.  The label says they contain milk, wheat & gluten & are not suitable for nut allergy sufferers.  The expiration date is a year out, but they will be long gone before then!  Walkers shortbread is a product of Scotland.  Highly recommended!"
Horrible,I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container.  Now that it's made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled.  This will be my last box of ever of Zico.  I'll be going back to O.N.E. or Vita Coco.
A great way to sample the many varieties,"I consider this assortment to be very helpful and honestly described. None of my samples were duplicates. Someone mentioned some were ""overfilled"" and all I can think of on that comment is that coffee does outgas when it is freshly roasted so that makes the top of some of the cups puff up a bit. Not a problem at all. Some folks complained about the paper bag. I don't see the problem. Nice assortment and fun to experiment."
"Great tasting, texture could be finer","It is my first time trying out Amaing grass.  It has a great taste but the texture could be finer.  Overall, it is a value for money product."
Not Gummy = Disappointed,"I have grown to like licorice and I eat all the licorice jelly beans at easter time. I've been trying out lots of different gummy candies here by both Haribo and some other makers and thought this would be an interesting combo. Unfortunately this product listing is misleading - these are NOT gummies. They are just licorice wheels - like regular licorice coiled up. I like the flavor, but they leave a pretty nasty aftertaste. As such, it's going to take me a long time to get through 5lbs of this stuff. It's not terrible candy, but left me VERY disappointed."
great flavor,This is great coffee especially if you like a bold flavor.  If you use this product you will be satisfied.
"awesome, its about time!!","pretty good transfer, but its totally uncut.. wow.. the ending uncut is soley the reason to get this cool early 80's gem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
no salt tenderizer,This no salt tenderizer works well just leave on a little longer than salted others.  The seasoning is very tasty and is a great alternative for people who want to control salt intake.  I will be buying this product from now on.  Loved it!
Versatile!,"Nice flavor enhancer for not only soups, but to use instead of water in cooking, such as for rice."
Great product,I bought this to use for canning blueberry pie filling. It works great!! Will definately be using this for all of my pie fillings from now on.
Beware,I love these cookies.  So I decided to order them in bulk.  They arrived stale and smashed.  I will be cancelling my next order.  I was very disappointed.
LOVE this tea; hate the shipping costs,"This is the best tasting herbal iced tea on the market, bar none.  We love it.  Five stars for an amazing product.<br /><br />Ding it one star for shipping costs.  This tea does not come in the can, as shown in the picture (and they clearly say that). It comes with the 10 tea bags crammed into a foil pouch.  I have no issue with the packaging.  Why I bring this up is that I find it hard to believe that it cost $7.95 to ship it.  The package is very small (about 4"" X 4"" X 10""), it is very lightweight since there is no can (about 11 ounces), and it shipped from the SF Bay Area, which is about 100 mi away!<br /><br />Mighty Leaf: Why do you not sell this product through Amazon the same way you sell many others, so that I could qualify for Super Saver shipping?  Would you please consider it?  Like I said, it is an awesone tea."
KuchenMeister Amaretto Cake,We have been buying this product for a number of years and recommend it highly.  There are differnt varieties (flavors)for you to enjoy.  We enjoy all of them!!!
feel good about it,"I believe in buying organic, since our children deserve the best, so this product was right for me. As far as, being better that other formulas - i simply cannot say. It worked well for my baby, who previously was very colicky, and we've tried Emfamil Newborn and SImilac Advance, Goodstart Protect and Good start Gentle. In comparison with Good Start, it does have just slightly less percentages on some of the ingredients; that might be the reason it is gentler on the stomach.  I got it at a great price, just about the price of the other formulas, so it was well worth it."
Dog Teeth Cleaner,"I read the reviews and decided to purchase Greenies for my two dogs.  Unfortunately, neither one will eat them.  I gave one box to my son and one to my daughter and thier dogs love them.  Go figure."
All Sardines are Not Created Equal,"I much prefer the taste of skinless sardines to tuna fish - they are milder and meatier and less ""fishy"".  Plus they lack the mercury content of tuna.  This has always been the brand I purchased at my Whole Foods store (for $2.79 per can), so I thought all sardines were pretty much the same.  My husband recently picked up two cans at the local Stop and Shop (King Oscar) and what a shock to my system.  For one, they still had the skin and TAILS on.  Two, the taste was more tinny than fish and the texture gritty.  I won't even open the other can.  Crown Prince quality and taste is far superior, and Amazon has them at a better price."
A dream come true!,"I haven't made ""oatmeal"" out of these, but we did use them to make homemade chocolate chip granola bars, and they were wonderful! They are a bit pricy but worth every penny."
Great Chips with less calories,These chips are delicious and good for you.  I buy the small bags and they are just right to eat with your lunch or for a snack.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves chips but doesn't like all the fat and calories.
Need magnifying glass to find liver.,"Finally, a canned cat food that the kitties are eating (at least for now, with a few vitamins & minerals. And this brand won't end up in the dog bowls! But I am hard pressed to find the chunks of liver - very skimpy - which is really O.K. because the cats leave what few itty bitty pieces that ARE in the can behind (3 Star for deceptive liver chunks/ 5 Star for chicken breast).  Looks almost as pictured, except for liver chunks.  I also bought the plain chicken from same company & will just go with that and rate a 5-STAR.  If your kitties LOVE cooked liver, you won't find enough in this recipe to satisfy their hunger - unless they eat all of the chicken too, which you probably wouldn't buy if cat didn't like chicken.  I am just so happy to transit the dry food & salty canned chicken addicted cat to a wet food to save on the kidneys. I do have one cat that loves raw liver & chicken, but I like to take a day off from adding vitamins and messing with raw meat (cutting, etc) so this is going to work out, it appears; hopefully for awhile - though one never knows with kitties.  Great today - terrible tomorrow!"
Good tea,"It's a very good tasting tea if you like licorice, that flavor is among the more potent flavors, in my opinion."
Sena case,"This is a great phone case, established for the especially iPhone. This case will make any iPhone user a great time, mine is black, but all Sena Cases are equally wonderful."
Really bad compared to Original Puffins,"Like most people, I tried Puffins Multigrain thinking it might be a healthier alternative to the normal cereal. Unfortunately it tastes really bad, almost exactly like cardboard it's uncanny.<br /><br />It's too bad because Original Puffins are amazing. The two cereals have almost nothing in common taste-wise."
Love It,I love this product.  Great for keeping me hydrated and balancing those electrolites.  I've been using this for years and can't bike ride without it.
My Chai,I like this chai. We first purchased it at [...] and I was distressed when they stopped carrying it. I am glad that I can get it from you cuz we take it to our mountain cabin. It is wonderful in the mornings and really starts my day off right.
My cats love these treats,My cats second favorite after the dairy flavor. I bought the 12 pack of both flavors and it is nice to have a supply on hand. This is one of my must have items to have at all times at home. I wouldn't want to face my cats if I ran out.
coffee Candy review,"If you like coffee but can not stop to get some these coffee flavored candies are just right, a bit hard to unwrap but hits the spot."
great product from a great company,"great purchase and a great value from a wonderful company who stands behind their product.<br />Had four of the trays for about five months, and they were in CONSTANT use. We definitely got our money's worth!!<br /><br />After five months, we had a little issue with a funny smell (it did not smell like any of the food we froze) so I tossed the trays.  Scandinavian Child replaced them immediately.  they even tried to match the colors we had!<br />they REALLY stand behind their product. Their customer service was amazing; their genuine helpfulness and accountability for their product is so refreshing!!<br /><br />I look forward to having they trays again, and I would definitely recommend them."
Bewildering and delicious candy!,"I first tried this candy while out on a hike, and decided that I needed to get some of my own! It's like a cross between a nerd and a jelly bean, with the outside being hard and sour while the inside is soft and sweet. Also, the different colors actually do indicate distinct flavors, which I always appreciate in a candy. Oh, and by giant, they mean about jelly bean size, but they range in size from about 1/4 of an inch to 3/4 of an inch. The only down side to this product is that inside the package are 24 ""small"" packets of the candy, which is a LOT of packaging and bad for the environment. For me, the packets are also too big for a single serving (I get a sugar overload about halfway through one.) In short:<br /><br />Good:<br />- Amazing delicious candy<br />- Bewilderingly textured, which makes them really fun<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Too much packaging (I would rather just buy a big bag of loose candies)<br />- Single packets are too big for single serving"
No Smoke Alarms with Udi's Bread,"Udi's bread is the best around, according to my husband. He also thinks it's even better toasted and, unlike some breads he has tried in the past, no crumbs fall into the toaster to start toaster fires and set off our smoke alarm! He thinks Udi's bread is the best because it tastes more like ""normal"" bread. We wish Udi's bread was carried by all our local grocery stores."
loved by dog; approved by owner,"My ten-year-old dachshund loves these! How much does he love them? Two weeks ago, he hid under the bed and whined. I took a packet of these treats and began opening the packet, he ran out from under the bed in anticipation and into the kitchen.<br /><br />My miniature dachshund is fed the very best of homemade organic diet (a take on the Spot-Stew diet). He is not a picky eater but will rarely go crazy for treats that are not home-made.<br /><br />The reason I like Newman's Organics is because finding organic lamb to incorporate in my dog's diet is impossible. Finding organic lamb meat is almost as hard as finding unicorn meat. These treats allow diversity in his food (he usually gets chicken, turkey, or tofu with oatmeal or brown rice and a variety of vegetables).<br /><br />The ingredients listed on these treats are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses.<br /><br />The analysis listed on these breaks down as follows: crude protein - 9.0% min, crude fat - 4.0z% min, crude fiber - 4.0% max, moisture - 11% max.<br /><br />I'd definitely say these are dog and owner approved!"
My picky eater old kitty loves this stuff!,"I have a 17 yr old cat who needs special food for her old lady kidney-- she runs and eats all of this food whenever I put it out. It's pretty expensive, the cans really aren't that big, but if she's happy, I'm happy. There's definitely something about the morsels that makes this more appealing than the pate style food. My cat likes this much more than hi-tor."
Firm quality chip,"Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there."
I'm switching from coffee,"Best tea, for my taste, that I ever found.  My wife gave me a sampler [...] and the Black Currant Black Tes really stood out to me.  I ordered an 8 oz package, which is nearly done, so I must order more, and I experimented with it. I have it at work, where I like to sip some on cold days (7 degrees west of Boston this morning).  The best, most convenient way I have found is using a coffee press.  I put a (roughly) measured amount of leaves in the press, fill it with hot water, let it steep about four minutes, and pour it out into a Bodum double wall glass.  Stays warm longer and looks beautiful through the glass.  After writing this description, I think I'll go make another glass.  Live long and prosper..."
Blah....,"There's not a lot of the premium fruit and nut stuff in here.  Mostly peanuts and raisins.  Some coconut shavings, a few almonds, lots of dried sub-par fruit.  I won't be buying again..."
Just right!,I have to keep something sweet near me at all times for when my blood sugar gets low. This mix seems to be just right for me. It's just the right amount of sweetness mixed with salty.
Alba,"I'm usually very particular in what I use treat my skin, but as it stand I have zero complaints about this product. It's smells great, it does fantastic damage control on my acne probe face, and I'm had no problems , no tightness, no residue, not a thing!"
"Good Product, Dishonest seller.","Ekobrew Reuseable K-cup Filter Includes 2 Ekobrews and 2- 1.75-oz Packages of Kirkland Signature Coffee: I would have rated this product better if the seller was not the issue. The product was as discribed and works OK. Just put your coffee in the filter and hit brew. I have read other reviews and agree with most, about coffee grounds causing issues. Be sure to clean any grounds off the rim when closing the filter, also if you use finely ground beans you may end up with some grounds in the cup. Overall this product is a coffee filter and it works as one.<br />Seller: I was not impressed with this seller. I have contacted the seller as requested by Amazon and after two weeks I have not heard anything. Anyway, I received the package containing: 2-Ekobrews and only 1-sample coffee (off-brand not Kirkland). Shipping was very slow, I received the package on the last estimated delivery date; and the package was actually shipped from COSTCO not the seller."
Good,"A pleasant change for the jerky I am used to. Low fat and low carb as well. So its Ostrich, but it does not taste weird like I thought it would. Actually, it tastes similar to beef."
Our 3 Cats Love This Food,"We have 3 cats that didn't seem to be enjoying their food very much--even though we'd tried several varieties. We received a sample of this food from our veterinarian and they acted like it was a real treat. So we decided to try a large bag and see if they acted more interested. Sure enough, they became more excited about eating. Since it is a bit pricey for our cat food budget, we mix it half and half with the less expensive food. They always pick this out to eat first. We'll be buying more for them."
just like nature valley!,"these are awesome little crunchy bars that taste just like the nature valley ""oat and honey"" ones, but with much better nutritionals and ingredients. a great, filling, slightly sweet snack!"
YUM!,I just made mashed potatoes with them-- perfect! sooooo easy to cook with! If these were organic they would be perfection! Soup is next!
Delicious,"This is a dark, chocolaty cofee. Grind works well in my stovetop espresso maker. I have tried many different espresso blends and was not sure how this would be since it is a blend of robusto and arabica beans but it is rich, dark, and as others have remarked, not at all acidic or bitter. My new favorite."
"My cats love this brand of canned food, but....","My cats love this brand of food, especially the salmon and turkey flavors. However, they leave the peas and carrots behind. Which makes me feel like I'm not getting my money's worth! However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some."
Health Valley organic Soup,I love all of the Health Valley organic soups... the only problem with this item was many of the cans came dented.<br />Amazon was good enough to credit us for it and I donated all of the cans.  I hope the next time we order<br />the cans are in better shape.
Good tea for the price,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
Amazinggggg!,These things are the best for long nights of last minute homework! Its so nice not having to get an upset stomach after drinking a whole pot of coffee. Instead one little bottle and im good for hours! I think this is the best product out there for energy.
Best Soda Ever,You will never go back to drinking another soda again.<br /><br />But if you want to buy this for $1.50 just go to any hispanic store.<br /><br />They have these everywhere. $4.00 seems a bit much for something you're going to enjoy every day.
Good standard cat food,"The Whiskas tuna is one of the few non-premium cat food that doesn't have grains or meal in it. My guys like this, but to be honest they really prefer the premium brands, Sigh!"
Just Like Old Times,Fruit slices were delicious...Just like I remember as a kid. Package arrived promptly and I received exactly what I wanted.
Most delicious way to get your green tea fix,"I really don't like green tea - it tastes bland and well, too green.  But I love this tea.  My son and I both are addicted to it.  Spicy and sweet - and so good for you!  Try it - you'll like it!"
cheaper locally,"Just so you know, you can usually get this at your local bodega or Mexican grocery store for less than half the price.  I'm like 1500 miles from Mexico and I can still find it locally."
My favorite snack...and now it's history,Why did Snyder's drop this product? Was I the only one who loved this snack? I really hate it when I find something this great and then it gets dropped from production.
Not great.,"Now I don't consider myself a genoa salami expert, nor do I really know what separates genoa salami from any other kind of salami, but I do eat a lot of cured meats and love them. I have eaten everything from the cheap presliced salami in the grocery store sandwich supplies to boars head to high-end, ""fresh"" artisan products. This is the worst thing I have tasted. Slim jims are better than this. It smells exactly like canned dog food and tastes exactly how I would expect canned dog food to taste, but saltier. Maybe this is what genoa salami is really supposed to taste like, but if you don't know exactly what your getting don't buy this.<br /><br />Update: I let it sit out of the plastic package and air out over night and it was actually decent. Nothing special but edible at least. It still had the dog food smell. I made three other guys at work eat it and the one who eats anything said he loved it (although he wouldn't give me $5 for the whole case). Another guy walked around with a sour look on his face for 3 hours and the third agreed with me that it was decent and would be OK with crackers and a sharp cheese, but was nothing special. Because of these experiences I have updated my review from 1 star to 3 stars."
When I eat this cereal it feels like there is a party in my tummy.,"This cereal is really good.  I used to really like cinnamon toast crunch, and I still do.  I tried this stuff, and was surprised how good it really was.  When you see a ""healthy"" version of something in the grocery store it usually doesn't taste near as good, but this is a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Not a whole lot to say really.  It is just good cereal, and if you like cinnamon toast crunch or similar cereal it is definitely worth a try."
THE BEST CANDY OUT THERE,"I have always been a candy person as long as I can remember and I came across this candy while I was spending time in Japan. I was instantly hooked. The flavor in these candies are awesome. I found myself picking a pack of these up almost everytime I was near a place that sold them. I brought a bunch home and shared them with friends and family. I haven't met a person yet who doesn't love them. Personal preference is purple grape and green apple. Some may disagree but the version of this candy with the english words ""Hi Chew"" are not as good as the Japanese version. Different wrapping and different texture slightly. Buy some of these today! They are amazing!"
"Good, but had better","The pecans are good, not great.  I've had others that were like eating candy.  Although, they do offer bigger cans."
"Great product.  Terrific for popcorn, and very healthy.",I can't say enough good about this product.  Love the taste.  Love the quality.  Outstanding for cooking and imparts a subtle coconut flavor.  The only con is that it can generally be bought for around $5.00 - $6.00 on special at the supermarket. Regular price is about the same.
Mrs May's Sunflower Crunch,"Love these delicious, cruchy snacks. They are easy to carry along for a quick snack that is healthy and lightly sweetened. Makes my happy to see my kids grab a good for them snack. But that means I have to purchase good options for them to choose from. Mrs May's products makes my job easier."
happy camper,"easy to order-arrived quickly. I ordered 2 bottles of it and they came separately on different days, (??) but they came! Am happy with that."
Mister Salty ...I have missed you so!,Remember Mister Salty pretzels (in the blue box with the pretzel man in the sailor hat)? Well here they are!  I was so excited to hear that a family member had found these on Amazon!  My case is almost gone and I will be ordering again soon!
Yummiest chai EVER,I used to get this stuff from Sam's Club but am not able to find it any more. I've tried various other brands and nothing was ever as creamy and delicious. There is just something about the spice blend and super smooth texture in Mystic Chai!
Good stuff for digestion,I bought this because I had tried some barley tea before and had heard it helps with digestion.  It certainly does while also having nice distinctive flavor.
Mint?,"This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but . .  where is the mint!?  Very, very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box, I really expected more flavor."
"Steel cut oats are the way to go, for the sake of texture.","While you may not be astounded by the difference in flavor from standard rolled oats (the standard these days on the shelves I see), the difference in texture is quite nice. That subtly chewy texture from oats that aren't over-cooked is nice to have, and makes quite a difference. As another reviewer stated, add some fruit or season it, don't expect a cereal grain to be appealing on its own. This is a healthy cereal with decent fiber content, some of which is soluble (helps with cholesterol) and some insoluble (colon health). And as amazon purchases go, the price alone isn't horrible."
Healthy Snack,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0068WZ7Y8"">Kind Fruit and Nut Bars Kind Fruit and Nut, Almond and Coconut 12 - 40g/1.4 oz bars [480g (16.8 oz)</a>] This is a tasty snack which sustains you if you miss a meal. I enjoy it also as a snack at any time where I do not want to prepare something."
stew,great tasting stew not as good as home made but great for a quick meal well worth the money will be buying more.
"Good, Fresh Granola","I use this granola to make myself a yogurt parfait every morning. I was pleasantly surprised by this granola. It's so yummy. I love the nuts - lots of pecans, walnuts and almonds. Most products say ""nut"" but then they're cheap w/ the amount of them. I like that almost every other bite, I get a nut. It tastes really fresh too. It doesn't have a lot of sugar, which is great in comparison to other granolas."
Love This Peppermint Tea!,What can I say?  This tea is delicious and calming....it is wonderful during any season!  Love it!  :)
Fantastic Pretzels,"We try to avoid wheat here and there, so we love substituting with spelt.  These pretzels are great.  They've been a regular snack in our pantry for a couple of years now.  Taste just like ""regular"" pretzels, only much healthier!"
It didn't work for me,"I just finished taking this along with the Blessed Thistle and it did nothing for me. All 100 pills, nothing. I guess everyting doesn't work for everybody. It's okthough, because I will stop nursing my daughter when she's six months anyways. In about a month. I did like the fact that I smelled like maple syrup. Weird, but true"
My favorite tea ever.,"I'm not a huge fan of flavored tea. This tea has just the right amount of subtle, delicious flavor. It also gives me a health buzz and makes me feel great! I drink about 3 cups a day. I'm a huge fan, its by far my favorite tea that's in a bag."
TASTES LIKE PEANUTS,"Tastes like peanuts, but still lacks something with the fat removed.  Tastes like peanuts, but still lacks something with the fat removed."
It is what it is...,"Were you expecting actual Mojitos from a powdered mix?<br /><br />Nah, of course you weren't.<br /><br />I didn't read the fine print when I ordered this product with promotional copy that began something like ""Ladies! ...""<br /><br />So - the Mojito Crystal Light Mocktail wasn't intended for a gentleman such as myself in the first place.<br /><br />It's not a Mojito, and this admittedly low-calorie ""approximation"" wasn't awful tasting.  But it doesn't taste like a Mojito either.  More like a glass of water where a Mojito had come by, danced a little salsa, and left just as quickly, leaving just a little residue behind.<br /><br />So - know what you're getting.  It's about 98% ""crystal light"" and ""1-2% mojito"".  If you're looking for THAT low-calorie beverage, here ya go."
"Very creative! (but ""caramel"" isn't the best name for it)","What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the ""worst"" of ""simple sugars"", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little).<br /><br />The name is misleading though - I can't feel ""caramel"" no matter how hard I stretch my imagination. It's delicious, just don't expect that dairy flavor.<br />This brand's other bars, Acai and Goji, are similar, but ""Maca"" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing."
Cindy,"When I first bought this mix for my husband who has celiac disease, I only made pancakes.  Then I bought a Cuisinart waffle maker and tried the waffle recipe on the bag - spectacular!  We went camping with our adult children and grandkids who have no dietary restrictions, and I could not make the waffles fast enough.  There is also a carrot cake recipe on the bag that I use to make carrot muffins, and then freeze them.  My husband can have a carrot muffin with his coffee anytime he wants a snack.  It is wonderful to have such a good versatile product on the shelf for anyone - whether they suffer from celiac disease or not.  Buying from Amazon make the work of difference to know that you can always get that specialized product delivered to your door with free shipping.  Thanks Pamela and Thanks Amazon!!!"
My dog loves it,"My dog loves this food and I don't have to worry about what's in it. With all of the bad dog food on the market, I'm glad there is a product like this one."
"Sorry, but I don't agree...","I have tried many protien drinks, and there are loads that I like - the taste, texture and mixability.  This one was spit out.  I read all the reviews and gave it a try, but I find there is a nasty and bitter taste to it that lingers long after it is gone - much like the taste of artificial sweeteners for me.  I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.<br /><br />I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant. I did give it several tries - cold, luke warm, hot. Used a blender, a shaker cup, an immersion blender - all with the same taste and consistency results. Sorry to sound so negative, but I did felt the need to share my experience - as it differs so much from the norm!"
Best Salmon ever!!,"This is my favorite of all three types that I tied, and this larger portion is a Great buy.<br />You wont go wrong with this brand."
Weak coffee,"It's organic, arabica coffee packaged in pods. I was looking forward to great tasting, conveniently packaged coffee. The box contains 15 pods. Though there's plenty of organic ads and blurbs on the box, there was not one line of instruction. I followed the suggestion on the product page here, and used my drip coffee maker with 8oz of water. The coffee was way too weak. I think using half the water amount would work better."
One of the best K-cups,"We've tried many of the K-cups that are available, and this is in our top 3. We prefer a darker, bolder flavor, and this one hits the mark. At the same time it's quite smooth."
My Kids (and I) love these!,"These are our GO TO store bought cookie. The kids love them. I love that they aren't filled with sugar and crap. Just whole grains and ingredients you can recognize on the label. They don't crumble when dunked (and believe me, we are dunkers). They make a great 'on the go' breakfast cookie when you are rushed in the morning. What mom doesn't love that?!?<br /><br />We have ordered several shipments of these from amazon. Always fresh and always fast. Best price. They run TWICE the price at the local 'natural' grocery chain."
Salt and Pepper!!!,"Popchips are delicious!!!  We bought a variety pack.  I love the Salt & Pepper though all flavors are good (according to my husband since I can't have any dairy I did not try those flavors).  While the chips are high in sodium, they are a nice healthy alternative to grease and salt laden fried potato chips.  Don't expect a traditional potato chip or even a pressed chip like Pringles.  They are different but delicious.  A 0.8 ounce bag contains only 100 calories and 10% of your daily salt (2000 cal diet).  The bag says they start with a potato and ""add a little heat and pressure and.. pop.""  Well, not quite.  The ingredients list: Natural Potato Ingredients (Potato Flakes, Potato Starch), Safflower Oil and/or Sunflower Oil, Rice Flour, Sea Salt.  If you need gluten-free, they are gluten free BUT they are made on equipment shared with wheat."
Perfect Blend and a true bargain for the price,"My co worker brought home a bag of ethiopia sidamo from a local market in ethiopia. I fell in love with this blend. I was very pleased to see I could acquire it from amazon.com. Its ground pretty fine and a little goes a looonnngggg way. This used to be my special ""treat"" coffee- but if you love something so much - why make it a treat. Its now my daily driver."
A good source of vitamin C,"I gave this product only three stars, not because the product didn't deliver on its promise of providing an easy way to get the vitamins and nutrients that you want, but simply because the taste was not on par with some of the other similar products that are out there.<br /><br />The vitamin squeeze is simple and easy to use, and it provides a  shot of vitamins and minerals in a zero calorie additive, this is the inherent strength of the product.  However, I only gave the product three stars because the strength of the taste was not as strong as other products like this (however, other products don't offer the shot of vitamins that this product offers).  With this product you get the additive nutrients, but you sacrifice a bit on the taste.  The taste is not bad, it simply is very weak, you have to add a great deal of the product in order to really get the taste out of it.<br /><br />I liked the product, didn't love it."
Terrible,"I was happy to find a graham cracker that was fairly healthy. But it doesn't matter what something is made with if you can't eat it. These were terrible... dry, tasteless, not even very sweet. Basically like eating a piece of crunchy cardboard. My preschooler took one happy, big bite and then looked at me in horror. I gave her permission to spit it out in the trash and then the whole box followed. Simply awful."
Who cares if they're healthy?,"Unfortunately, we can no longer buy these in our local Target store, so we have to get them here. These cookies are a delicious, low(ish)-cal treat to calm my sweet tooth. They're chocolatey and crunchy, and much better than any of the other low-cal cookies I've had. Highly recommended."
A great treat,"My young Havapoo was very unhappy when I put him in his cage at night.<br />After I bought this product for him as a treat before going to bed, he is readily willing to enter his cage, munch a few little pieces of the dried liver and go to sleep quite happy. I can recommend this product to all pet lovers."
great tasting,Enjoy using this product in all my cooking most of all I enjoy ordering from Amazon- they have such great customer service.
I like it.,"I've used a few different brands of Stevia including Stevita Supreme and Sun Crystals (stevia mixed with sugar).<br /><br />I honestly don't find a huge difference between stevia of any brand.  It's a bit like asking which sugar tastes best.  On the other hand, I do find the Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia slightly better tasting than some other brands.  It's also a little more expensive than some other brands, but not overly so.<br /><br />One reviewer commented on the fact that this product contains ""silica"" and that silica is used when electronics are packaged.  What you find packaged with electronics is not the same as silica for food service use. Just like oil you put in your car is not the same kind of oil you use for cooking.<br /><br />Fine particle size silica, or its chemical cousin sodium silicoaluminate are used in a lot of food products. Especially, powdered food products. A primary use of the silica is to act as a flow agent, anti-packing agent, and water scavenger. Common table salt is a common example. Dissolve a teaspoon of table salt in a glass of water and you will observe that the solution is cloudy, not clear. This cloudiness is not undissolved salt, it is the silica-type mineral added to keep the salt flowing in humid conditions."
Nice coffee,"I am not a coffee expert, but this makes a good cup of coffee.  With prime and a subscription, it is dirt cheap for the quality."
winner winner chicken dinner!,"My dog LOVES these.  She loves to chew on things and this is the first toy that she has not destroyed within the first week.  We have had the ball that these treats insert into for over 2 months and it still is like new.  The chicken flavor appears to be her favorite so far.  They will last several days if we don't take the toy away, longer if we limit her exposure or rotate toys. She will lick and lick and chew and chew for hours.  Inserting the treats is a bit difficult but not too bad. We have not had any problems with her removing the treat as others have described, my guess is that they are not getting the treat set into the ball correctly.  This chew toy is a keeper!"
Quickly dissolving fruity drink,"This to-go iced tea was very easy to prepare.  The powder mix instantly dissolved in cold water.<br /><br />The strawberry flavor is refreshing but reminded me of Crystal Lite or Koolaid.  My son found it too sweet; however, it was just right for me.<br /><br />It seemed more like a fruity drink rather than a tea beverage."
Hard to find Sukiyaki Sauce,"For some unknown reason many stores will not stock this item. They carry some of the companies other sauces but the Sukiyaki can be really hard to find. I was thrilled to find it here and in a good quantity and at a great price. It was shipped quickly, arrived quickly and was just a VERY good experience all the way around on a product that I already knew was great.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CSE7R4"">Kikkoman Sukiyaki Sauce (Pack of 3)</a>"
Best as a Latte,"When I opened the pouch and sniffed I was very pleased because it smelled spicy, but also richly creamy-pumpkin. But you often can't tell what something is going to taste like from its dry smell, and that seems to be the case here. For this first tasting I prepared the matcha with just hot water (then added a little sugar later). I got almost no froth when whisking this one, which has to be an effect of the flavoring somehow. It smelled very clovey when prepared, that really is the dominant aroma.<br /><br />The flavor of the matcha when prepared straight is pretty subtle, but improved when sugar is added. When is really shines, however, is in latte form.  The thing about pumpkin pie is that it's creamy and sweet, so adding more creamy and sweet elements really brings out the pumpkin pie flavor. I will definitely really enjoy drinking it this way this fall."
Toothsome and crisp,"A healthy adult take on childhood favorite grahams, these crackers contain a lot of whole grains, and nothing mysterious in the ingredients list.  At 110 calories for 2 cracker ""sheets"", they would seem a wholesome snack.<br /><br />Compared to ""traditional"" graham crackers, the texture is firmer, with less of the dissolve-in-your-mouth; they're a bit more effort eat.  I normally use graham crackers mostly to make dessert crusts; I'm not sure the oat-heavy crackers are the the best choice for that purpose.  Since I don't like to stock more than one kind of grahams, I dropped my rating by 1 star.<br /><br />The pleasingly readable ingredients list, the 55% post-consumer recycled box, and the stamp of the Nature Conservancy (a respected habitat preservation group) help give credibility to the ""Back to Nature"" branding.<br /><br />Recommended."
"Attention, Peanut Butter Cookie Lovers","This bar tastes just like a peanut butter cookie!<br /><br />It is truly amazing.  There is no flour, sugar, eggs, chemicals, preservatives, or anything bad.<br /><br />There are only natural, healthy ingredients.<br /><br />This bar is suitable for vegans.<br /><br />This bar is suitable for health-conscious people or people on a diet.<br /><br />If you like peanut butter cookies, but don't want to eat them because of all the bad stuff in them, then this bar should fill the bill and satsify your craving!!!!"
YUMMY,I am eating these cookies as I am writing this review and OMG. I love coconut flavored cookies and these are really good. I usually buy Ranger cookies from the bakery for church but I might replace buying those for these cookies. I bought these from a neighborhood Kroger which was reasonable pricing. They seem overpriced by this seller though.
1st class product,Could have never had made a better and more beautiful cookie!!!! The people who received these as gifts were so impressed and i was proud to say they came from [...].<br />Why to go!!!!!!!
"The ""salt and pepper"" chips bite back!","These are really good, but whoa! there's no missing the pepper. Forget the kids' lunchbox, save these for yourself, and keep a glass of water nearby."
"Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities","One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!"
jttodd,"Makes a great cup of sugar free-fat free 25 calorie hot cocoa!  It's not quite as ""rich"" a product as some of  the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!"
Made both my dogs vomit and eat less.,"We switched to this food from Purina One because the ingredients are advertised to be of much higher quality, and we wanted to improve our dogs' diet. We made a smooth transition to this food by slowly mixing it in with their existing food, as vets recommend. Once the transition was complete, they were vomiting their meals several times per week, which they had never done before the switch. We continued to feed them this food for about a month to see if it changed, and they still have problems keeping it down. I often see them eating grass to induce vomiting as well, so I think its giving them a stomach ache. They also got to the point where they just didn't want to eat the food at all sometimes, which I've never seen them do. We switched to Newman's Own dog food now, and they're eating much better already.<br /><br />I wish I had done some research on this food before purchasing it. Type ""Wellness dog food vomit"" into Google, and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product."
Addicted!,I bought these for my mother-in-law who is addicted to tootsie pops. After trying them I am now seriously addicted! Figures I would like flavors that are a limited addition. Also the pops arrived at my house a day early. Will definitely reccomend the tootsie pops and the seller to my friends.
Great tasting high quality dark chocolate,This is the dark chocolate you can eat every day guild free since it is very good for you. As more and more scientific evidence shows that dark chocolate is good for you I have been trying to find a bar that is very high in the percent coco bean but also tastes good. I had first bough a 95% bar that did not taste good. This bar has the right combination of taste and % for me and I suspect for others as well.
MY FAVORITE HOT CEREAL,"MUCH TO MY DISMAY WHOLE FOODS NO LONGER CARRIES OLD WESSEX FIVE GRAIN CEREAL. I USUALLY STOCK UP ON IT WHEN I GO TO THE STORE. I HAD TO ORDER IT ON LINE AND TAKE A CASE.  MY GRANDAUGHTER WHO IS EIGHT WAS EATING IT OUT OF THE BOX. I GAVE MY DAUGHTER A FEW BOXES AND SHE MADE HER FAMOUS COOKIES WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS FROM THE RECIPE ON THE BOX. I USUALLY DON'T GET TO EAT LUNCH UNTIL AFTER TWO O'CLOCK SO THIS CEREAL REALLY KEEPS ME WELL FORTIFIED.  I ADD PROTEIN POWDER, WHEAT GERM AND GROUND FLAX SEED TO THE HOT CEREAL AND ALSO SOY MILK.  WHAT A TREAT!!!"
My dog is REALLY sick from these,"I gave my dog her first jumbone two days ago. Since then she has been super sick, lethargic, and throwing up about 3x per day. If this does not get better tomorrow morning I will be taking her to the vet :("
Slurp. It's gone.,"I discovered Petite Cuisine when I tried to switch my 13-year-old cat from dry food to canned; I tried every variety of canned food, and while he wouldn't touch any other brand, he inhaled this stuff. I'm a vegetarian, but Petite Cuisine looks more like real chicken/fish than anything I've seen - actual, identifiable strips of meat!  What a concept.<br /><br />My new kittens love it as well, and Chicken Pot Pie is by far their favorite flavor.  It's got a little more fat than the fish flavors, but still well within the AAFCO guidelines. It's also a little more expensive; you can usually get 24-packs of fish flavors for $18 if you go to the manufacturer's web site. But the chicken pot pie makes a great treat for a healthy dinner.<br /><br />But: check out Joe's post about menadione."
Gu is good stuff!,"A few months ago I originally purchased the strawberry banana flavor. I personally though the taste was awful and the texture was so thick it was disgusting. I couldn't even swallow it straight out of the package, I had to chew on it and swish it around my mouth with water and then force it down my throat. I let one of my friends try it and we had to stop the workout because the taste made him sick. However, the Vanilla flavor does NOT have any of those problems. The flavor is great and you can really taste the vanilla flavor. One of my friends thought it was a little on the sweet side but I love it. It is also a lot thinner, I can easily stick it in my mouth and gulp it down without wasting any time. Gu is good stuff, I can feel the difference on longer rides and it definitely helps me maintain my level of performance."
Great sauce -- So so packaging.,"I have tried 4 of the Scarpetta brand sauces and a spread.  They are all excellent.  On par or better than other premium sauces.  Nice big chucks of tomatos, well spiced and natural ingredients.  That said: I have experienced the same problem as other reviewers whose package arrives with leaking or swollen bottles.  Amazon provided a quick replacement but the replacement had a leaking container too.  If you're feeling lucky, buy this sauce.  Inspect each container immediately upon receipt.  Open the lid and make sure the seal is intact.  If the container is swollen, don't open it unless you want to clean sauce off your ceiling.  My personal odds are 4 good batches to 2 leaking batches."
Wholesome Ingredients,"I made my soup with four cups of low sodium chicken broth, one cup of the mix, some chopped onion and carrots, and a sprinkle of salt-free garlic-herb seasoning.  It was delicious, and VERY filling -a meal all by itself!  Next time I make it I won't add anything extra, just to see how it tastes that way.*  As it was, I kept adding water and ate on one pot of soup for four days ... (""Pease porrige hot, Pease porrige cold..."") Another reviewer mentioned that the soup was very thick when mixed four to one as recommended, and that is very true.  It could be eight to one and still make a nice soup...  I highly recommend it however you cook it!<br /><br />*I returned to lower the rating from five stars to three.  When I tried making the soup with just water and chopped onions, carrots and celery (no spices or broth), there was no rich flavor whatsoever.  This mix does have a wholesome mix of beans, peas and lentils, but it does not contain any spices or flavorings to make it a true soup mix.  It should be called ""Bob's Red Mill Veggie Mix to Add to Your Own Soup."""
Yum,Ahmad fruit flavored teas are my favorite.  So glad that Amazon is carrying them now.  I had to rely on one box here and there in Marshalls but now I can stock up.<br /><br />All the flavors are very natural tasting and the tea is full bodied and satifying.
Great cereal but not a great deal,This cereal is great with or without milk and it is easy to finish a box quickly. Amazon ships the cereal quickly and the cereal is always fresh and months away from the expiration date.<br />While I love this cereal the recent decision to reduce the number of boxes to 3 without adjusting the price appropriately does not differentiate this package from buying boxes in the local grocery. I wish Amazon would reconsider selling this as a pack of 4.
Ribena (Original Flavor) Concentrate - 600ml (Small) Bottle,"The product arrived in USPS Priority Mail in good condition.  The product is fresh, as I've had concentrate that was sitting in a store shelf for a long time and the syrup has turned brown instead of the reddish hue.  Just in case you're wondering, this product was available locally in San Francisco Asian grocery stores and some Safeway supermarkets that have Asian cooking sections.  But I think the local distributor no longer stocks them as I cannot find them anywhere local for the last 2 years.<br /><br />The 600ml bottle is the smaller size of the two available sizes.  The one that I am used to the the 1000ml (1 liter) bottle which is slightly larger and is more common as the American size.  These turned out to be a smaller than I expected.<br /><br />The internal pull top opening is no longer circular but star shaped, allowing for a better flow stream without gurgling.  I mix this at a very diluted ratio of 10:1 of water:concentrate.<br /><br />I also recommend the IKEA ligonberry concentrate which comes in a 300ml glass bottle for $5 at the IKEA store.  It tastes close (a bit sweeter) but is of course a different fruit.  I'm glad I was able to find Ribena from Amazon as I have been craving this a long time now.  I still prefer the original blackcurrent flavor to the new lemon-blackcurrent or other fruit mix flavor blackcurrent concentrate.  I've grown up drinking the original Ribena and the new flavors don't appeal to me as much."
Decent taste for sugar free,I am not a big fan of sugared drinks and I always try to consume sugar free liquids. Red bull regular is a taste I do not like so I take the sugar free kind. This is better to mix with vodka too since you don't need more sugar with alcohol.
Cat Treats,One of our Ragdoll Cats has an allergy to chicken and this is the only treat we could find that does not contain chicken.It is a quality all natural product.
We love Pop Chips!,"We love pop chips at our house, they are a great addition to a Weight Watchers diet. They are kind of pricey when they are regular priced at the store, So we buy them in bulk either on Amazon, or when they go on sale at CVS pharmacy. Our favorite flavor is the BBQ. Great snack, no guilt!"
"Pretty Good, VERY Healthy","Finally, someone has created baked chips that have a crunchy texture and good flavor.<br /><br />If you really attend to your health you want to avoid foods fried in oil, top 3 being french fries, donuts and potato chips. Your body has a tough time breaking down the oil once it's fried.<br /><br />So the Popchips are an excellent option for potato chip lovers. (though I prefer the Chili Lime flavor over the Sweet Potato)."
Healthy additions & substitutions,"Use applesauce, coconut oil & almond milk as liquid ingredients. Sprinkle truvia to add sweetness. Add 2 scoops of lactose- free protein powder & you've created a delicious & healthy protein bar for pre- or post- workout!"
"Palatable, but flat.","While I admire the ambitious effort to make a raw food snack that includes a vast array of additional nutrients, this just didn't do it for me.  I wish I could recommend something else that is better, but I'm new to the world of raw foods and found this to be bland and just a tad ""chalky"".  The texture is somewhat moist and chewy, but leaves a dry feeling in the mouth after chewing for a while (and you will have to chew for a while).  My husband thought it was ""okay"" but it didn't leave him asking for more, and my kids were not impressed, either.<br /><br />I do give it 3 stars because it's very healthy and you really can taste the strawberries in this. It's not a hint of strawberry, but has a good, fruity flavor. However, it also has a strong, oat-ey flavor, as well, making it taste somewhat like a stick bar of dry breakfast oatmeal, if you could imagine that.  If you like your foods a little on the milder side with few seasonings, this may actually be appropriate for you. If you're like me and prefer something strong and flavorful, this probably won't float your boat."
Good!,"The individual chocholate squares are bigger than I thought, about an inch in length on each side. These chololates are good, I would purchase them again."
"Best gluten free pretzels, best price","Our son has celiac but our entire family prefers these to regular pretzels - my father in law, too. Fortunately, I can buy a case on line and use subscribe and save. It's about $2.50 a bag cheaper than buying locally."
Entertaining,"I bought both this toy as well as the Buster Food Cube and while both are great toys, this one is nice because it is much quieter and a lot easier to get the food in and out.  If your dog isn't as good at manipulating things with her paws then this toy may be a better choice for you because it is easier to use with just their mouths grabbing the toy to get the food out.  My dog pushes on the top of the jug with her paw and usually gets the food out that way."
Brew smaller cup size for full flavor,I LOVE the flavor of this coffee but my normal portion size on my Keurig Brewer must be changed to the next smaller size down or it's like drinking water.<br /><br />The flavor with the smaller portion is really delicious so it's worth having a smaller cup.  I would buy again but for a full size of similar flavor I will stick with Green Mountain Coffee Limited Edition Golden French Toast.
Great product,This product is of very good quality. I was disappointed though in the way the product was packed as much of the Biscotti was broken during shipment.
great cookies,"i love these cookies. i can eat wheat and gluten, but i still like to order these."
Fantastic rice!,"I love this rice! It always turns out perfectly (I use a saucepan--not a rice cooker). Just make sure you follow the directions. The RiceSelect products are consistently good. Another plus is that they are grown and processed here in the great state of Texas, in Galveston county. As another reviewer mentioned, the plastic containers the rice comes in are a pleasure to use, and can be recycled to hold macaroni, fideo, etc."
THESE PISTACHIOS ARE GREAT!,GREAT FLAVOR ~ JUST A TOUCH OF SEA SALT [THE BEST KIND IF YOU'RE GOING TO EAT SALT AT ALL] WILL DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN. NOW TO FIND A BABY NUTCRACKER TO OPEN THE FEW THAT DON'T CRACK OPEN ALL THE WAY!  :)
Tastes Like Celery,"I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds."
A tang that packs a punch!,"My daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked."
Great Product,Our Rottweiler just love these.  We get a package a month for her.  Never any problem. They also don't stink that bad. She chews them non-stop her favorite treat.
Too sweet and does not quench thirst,"Some may like this product but I'm not one of them. I've tried three different flavors and have found all of them to be too sweet anand consequently are not good at quenching one's thirst. The size is nice but really, that's the only good thing I can say about this product. Note, this is a very subjective review and others may love ""Switch"", just not me."
Best Tasting EArl Grey,The Twinings Earl Grey is just a solid stanout performer.  I have been drinking it for years and I can only recommend it highly
Yuck...they are really not tasty at all!,"I ordered these to try them out and the price was cheaper than the supermarket.  The cinnamon apple bars are not tasty at all.  They have a very dry texture and taste chalky with a (surprisingly) bitter after taste.<br /><br />Basically, they are not palatable...there are better fiber bars out there--especially the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YNQRSM"">Gnu Foods Flavor & Fiber Cinnamon Raisin 1.6 oz. (Pack of 16)</a> --<br /><br />I know a few people gave high ratings to this, but honestly, these bars are not very good at all.....YUCK is the best way to describe them."
what a value!!!,"First of all, the sizes vary a bit, which in fact I love especially if you have different sized pups. Most of them are very thick with some smaller sized mixed in.  Love that they are grass fed and hormone/antibiotic free. This is EXTREMELY important to me!!! The length was near perfect on every one. The smell was minimal. My dog loved them and I recently purchased more. The price is out of this world!!!! I was paying over $7.00 for one, locally. Great product, great price, great value!"
"Low odor, still tasty!","I ordered the smaller pack of these to check out the quality and at first thought they were a little too thin for me, however, they have proven to be perfect for my little papillon! So I decided to buy the 30 pack! Not big enough for my golden retrievers, but my papillon LOVES these sticks! They don't smell as bad as others I've bought which iswonderful! They also arrived very quickly which was great because I had run out and he wanted more very soon. This is a great value for the money."
Fantastic Crispy Airy Chips,"Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor"
Fruit and Nut Breakfast Cookie,The 12 individually wrapped cookies came in good condition. This is a great tasting cookie and I like it toasted and not.
Smooth taste,"Coffee has very smooth taste.  I had to do some research as to how to use the pods.  Best way I found to use pod was to cut open pod and place into coffee filter or just place unopened pod into coffee filter.  It worked quite well and the coffee was not weak, but had a strong smooth taste."
"not really my cup of tea, or coffee in this case","Have tried many coffee's in this price range, some local, some from amazon and other places.  Read some of the reviews about this and decided to try it.  Did not like it, always had a very bitter taste to it, no matter how I tried to grind it.  I prefer a smooth coffee, as I make it strong to begin with, and this is not it.  If you like to use flavor additives like creamers and such, then this would be fine.  But if you enjoy actually tasting the coffee, there are much better out there for the same price.  I finally have settled on a Kona blend sold on amazon that has given me what I was looking for.  Would not recommend"
Great coffee,"This coffee is great for anytime.  It really doesn't taste like mocha to me, just a good cup of coffee."
"Nice Organic, Cage-Free Option for Sensitive Stomach","My foster dog, Rex, came to me severely underweight with nutrient defficiencies and digestive issues.  After a few weeks of prescription food, I phased him into Newman's Own Advanced Formula.  Not only does he love it, but he's gaining weight marvelously and digests it easily.  It was recommended by many, and has minimal to no fillers.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoy the product because as a life-long vegetarian, it was important to find a food with strict animal compassion practices, and Newman's Own apparently has those.  It's affordable as well.  Sticking with it!"
Simply Delicious!!!!,"I ordered these K-cups on a preorder for $9.99.  They are becoming my favorite flavor.  I love, love this flavor.  It was<br />an excellent deal.  Grove Square has a great product."
"Stale, Rancid Oil Taste, And if You Like Even the Tiniest Bit of Salt Flavor on Your Chips...","...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging ""peanuts"". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great ""premium"" brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!"
Knorr Dill Salad spices,"Have already responded to this survey.<br />Very happy with the product, delivery, etc.<br />Was glad to find the source as the product can only be obtained over seas (not in USA).<br /><br />DMcDonald"
"The best conditioner, hands down!","This conditioner smells great on my dog for weeks!  I have an Australian shepherd who is always in the mud, woods, dirt and getting wet.  He smells great even after a swim in the pond.  I would purchase this item if it were $20 a bottle!"
Buffalo Bills Spicy Shredded Beef Jerky,i like the spicy jerky very much but the amount in each cannister was poor and was not worth the money i paid
Anyone for Tea?,"PG Tips makes a great, robust and flavorsome cup of tea, and Amazon has excellent deals.  Getting a good, strong cup of hot tea (prepared the classic English way - hot, strong, with milk and sugar) is key to starting my day off the right way and PG Tips does the trick. I subscribed to Amazon's regular delivery option and got an even better price.  Cheers!"
unsatisfied,This is the only guava jelly ive tried but it tastes like apple sauce. The shipping was prompt but i was disappointd with the flavor
My dogs love this but....,My dogs love these treats in many of the varieties and I usually get the 12 ounce packages for them...  This time I got two of the smaller packages - 4 ounces -  not realizing that the treats themselves are also miniature - too small for my dogs...  Will return to the 12 ounce packages ...
Prepare to gain wieght,These have the same amount of sugars like High-fructose corn syrup as many chocolate bars. You eat these every day and you will be gaining weight in no time.
Very Good Taste for a Sugar-Free Syrup,"Like the other sugar-free Torani flavors I've tried, you (or at least I) can't tell that it's sugar-free.  The taste is excellent once you get the amount to use dialed in.  If you like caramel flavoring, you won't be disappointed."
A tasty companion,This creamer helped me save my coffee from tasting so off. I definately recomend the saver 3 pack. It's helped me satify some avid coffee drinkers.
excellent coffee!!,I have bought many different flavors of La Crema Coffee and everyone has been excellent!!! This flavor is no exception!
"Fantastic, and well worth the price","I bought this jerky for my husband because he loves jerky and spicy food (this one seemed like a no-brainer based on the reviews). To be honest, he was thrown off by the very bright red color when he originally got it and let the jerky sit for a few days while he worked up the courage to try it (bright red, chipotle, habanero, it was a little intimidating). Once he tried it, he fell in love. It's soft, tender, flavorful, not too salty, in essence, in his words, it's like ""spicy carne asada, and not the junk, tough carne asada you get at the tex-mex places"". It's all he can do to only eat one piece, he loves it!  Well worth the price."
How can you go wrong with Frosted Flakes?,"There are 2 regular sized cereal bags inside this giant box, so you don't have to worry about it getting stale."
"Dogs love 'em!  Plus they're entirely USA grown, processed, etc","I am always on the lookout for dog treats made ENTIRELY in the USA.  That is, the animals are born, raised and slaughtered here, and the processing and packaging takes place here.  I've been reading horror stories about products from China, but you also have to be aware that even those that say ""Made in the USA"" could include ingredients from China.  I've looked into it.  I don't trust food products with Chinese origins, period.  And I'd rather give the biz to companies loyal to US workers.<br /><br />All that said, as disgusting as lungs and hearts might sound to me, dogs love this stuff!  And they're satisfying enough for my 15 lb Pomeranians that one does the trick, they don't just gulp them down and swallow them, and keep coming back hoping to get more.  They take more than a nanosecond to consume.  Finally, there are no added ingredients.  One Pom is diabetic, so no added starches/sugars for him.<br /><br />Great product, good value for the quality, and made in the USA!"
"No Heat, No Flavor","First let me say that I just got an order in of 5 different spices, all are great except the cayenne, I do allot of cajun cooking and know cayenne very well, I have been using the no salt cajun mix for almost a year now and it is as good as the mixes I get in Louisiana ( Tonys ), I wanted to get some cayenne to bump up the heat for marinades and was disapointed with this product, has more of a parika taste than a pepper taste. If it was a prime item I would return it."
Good burgers!,I buy from Omaha almost every month. Great meat and wonderful desserts! They are the main provider of meats for my family.
Delicious Extra Crunchy,"These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.<br /><br />They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.<br /><br />A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Enjoy!"
Wonderful!,"I was given a box of this when I purchased my kitten. He loves it and we love it. It scoops well, isn't dusty, is safe for kittens and isn't scented (I am chemically sensitive so this matters a lot to me). Even if he ate it it wouldn't harm him since it is just wheat. If I keep the minimum of 3"" level in the litter pan it doesn't stick to the bottom. I've been amazed at how well it scoops. I just scoop it morning and evening and it doesn't get smelly at all.<br /><br />You may want to get this locally since, after shipping, the discount usually works out about the same."
best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%"
Excellent Flavor,"Glad to see that Amazon carries Rockstar Energy Drinks. Personally, I enjoy this flavor compared to the other Rockstar and energy drinks. It has a great flavor and definitely boosts my energy! This one in particular is hard to find in stores and I am glad that this can be purchased with Free Shipping and have it delivered to my door. Try this out, you won't regret it!"
Son loves it,My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  It's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.
Pretty good for a mix,This is pretty good for it being a mix.  Had good flavor and it's a good on the go beverage.  Nothing needs to be added.
OMGZ Movie Theater Popcorn!,We just ordered some of this popcorn with our new popcorn machine from discounttommy and its the best popcorn we've ever had hands down. Defiantly going to be getting some more when we get through these! -Jason
veeeerrrrrryyyyy good deal,$6 for a 50 packs is a great deal. at 7-11 its a dollor a 1 pack
tasty,At 80 cents a piece these are a good deal. They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not; it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars. I'm torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price. One of each makes a good cheap lunch @ $1.60.
Yummy Granola Bars!,"I usually hates granola bars.  They tend to be too sweet and I am not crazy about the texture.  My 3-year-old son's daycare requires all new kids to pack an earthquake emergency kit (yet, we live in California) and one of the required items is 10 granola bars.  I bought this just to prepare the kit, hoping that he would never have to eat them.  Since the product comes with 30 bars, I took some to the office as my emergency stash.  They are actually quite tasty.  My son also likes them as a quick afternoon snack while we are out and about.  Never thought we would actually consume them when I bought this but it looks like we will reorder soon.  And it's organic!"
Dogs are not impressed,"When looking at the product, I thought that it would be a good way to entertain my dogs. Unfortunately, after a few minutes of looking and pulling they gave up and never went back to the toy again. I think that the Kong is a superior toy to hide food and keep dogs occupied."
Great breakfast bars!,"I am a teacher, and these bars are sooooooo handy to have at school when my class is in PE.  I can eat them on the go!  Plus, they are good for me, too!"
"great taste, hoping for just as great results","This product tastes AMAZING and somewhat sweet, naturally. Seems to have plenty of ingredients that health reviews agree are supposed to be good for what this tea is claiming to do - enhance the function of your mind and memory. I suffer from terrible memory, and while it is too early to tell, i am going to continue drinking this (alternating with Brain Booster tea) for the next 3-6 months, as it definitely cannot hurt, and if nothing else, is delicious. I will try to update after 3-6 months."
Great for dogs with stomach problems,"My dog gets sick eating a lot of dog treats (even Milkbones), but has always done well with all the Booda bones.  She really loves them & they're good for getting rid of the tartar on her teeth.  I highly recommend these."
Less would have been more,"The taste of the Newton's Fruit Thins was pretty good. It's a nice crunchy treat, and I really enjoyed the cranberry citrus and oat flavor. It was like a really thin and crisp designer oatmeal cookie.  I would have liked the product more if the cookies were smaller in size.  The snacks are rather large and round in shape, and being so thin they easily break and crumble. If they were 1/4 of the current size you could easily consume them in one or two bites and eliminate the crumbs.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. The outer foil bag isn't bad, but the inside plastic tray is clumsy and tough to slide back into the resealable wrap, and combined with the large crumbly nature of the cookie already mentioned above I doubt very much if anyone buying these in a store ends up with more than half of the cookies actually being whole by the time they get home.  Ordering them from Amazon easily guarantees half the product inside will be in pieces -- but like I said... the smaller size (even if they are broken pieces) makes 'em easier to eat!"
Awesome bread mix,This bread mix is really good it is Aldi's Brand and they are not carrying it right now! What  a disappointment!
New and NOT Improved,"I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste ""off"" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :("
Great alternative to sugary soda,I put this in the kids lunches for school.  They loved it as it made a nice change from straight fruit juice or UHT milk - it tasted like a soda to them but I loved that they were getting the nutrition of the fruit without the extra sugar.
Not for me!,"I tried.. I really tried... I honestly tried...but I couldn't eat these things.  I will stick to the kind i purchase locally int he grocery store as they are crisp (really crisp) and not bad on taste with 19% fiber.<br />Even though these Scandinavian brand was recommended by Dr. Os and lots of others I just can't handle them. Tsate is not good in my opinion, texture is horrible, and Sahara Desert sand would be more moist.  I bought a large quantity of these things so regret doing that.  I though thet would be like my regular Crispbread.  I might be good for others but not for me."
One of our favorite breads,"The Hodgson Mill 9-Grain Bread Mix is one of our favorites. It has an excellent flavor and is better than any store brought bread including the artisan types. We just love to eat this fresh from the bread maker and consider it to be a dessert. We use the light crust setting on the bread maker, pour the bread mix in followed by the yeast with just the right amount of warm water...a few hours later and we have an excellent loaf of bread."
Great canned salmon!,"We've been eating the Wild Planet tuna for a while (and it's also excellent), and decided to give this a try. It's more expensive, but very very good, with real salmon flavor and texture. It truly is skinless and boneless, and in nice big chunks (it's like a big piece of fish in the can, with maybe some smaller chunks to fill the space and weight needs). And being wild-caught, and in BPA-free cans, there's the added assurance that they're good for you!<br /><br />This would be excellent in a salmon salad, but what I do with it most often is a salmon hash, with sweet potatoes. It's also good mixed into mac & cheese! For those of us who don't have regular reliable sources of fresh wild sockeye this is really a great option.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: after the comment here I did further research, and the cans for the salmon are NOT, as of mid-2012, BPA-free (the tuna and sardines are). Sorry for the misinformation; I had seen reports that all of the Wild Planet seafood was BPA-free, but apparently (according to the company) there are no Alaska plants working with BPA-free cans and their other tests to date have not been satisfactory.<br /><br />Since it's an occasional rather than everyday for me, and the quality is otherwise so high, I'll keep using this. But others should make their own decisions."
I love this tea,When the British store in our area closed it's doors I didn't think I'd ever get to enjoy my favorite tea again. Wala!!! Thank you Amazon for listing Harrogate Tea and thank you Harrogate for sending it so quickly. I love your tea.
Delicious!,Excellent Peppermint tea - can't beat the price - would pay quite a bit more on store shelves...highly recommend the chamomile also
Sugar free,"great price, great product. good alternative to Nestley's Quick when you're a diabetic and love chocolate milk or just need something to get you started in the morning when you don't have time for a real breakfast. With the good price I can enjoy chocolate milk more offen without feeling like I just ""bought the bank""."
Fantastic exfoliator,"I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel."
Good stuff at a great price,"These are good granola bars.  We buy them at the grocery store but are way cheaper here.  The only problem is sometimes they get very hard (the grocery store ones are softer).  I'm not sure if that's from shipping here in a cold climate or what.  Also, the expiration date can be very close.  I was getting low on the bars and then ordered more and realized the expirate date is coming up in a few weeks when the last case had a later date.  So it makes me wonder how fresh these are."
Great Product,"Cooks really well, with no husk. No need to wash extensively, quick rinse totally did it. Takes about 40 min to cook as recommended on the package. With 6g of protein and great flavor it is by far best brown rice substitute."
Awesome!,My boyfriend and I both love coconut water and have been trying different brands for a while. We decided to stick with Zico but it doesn't contain extra sugar or other fruit juices like some of the other ones that we've tried. What I also like is the fact that I can subscribe for the product through amazon to get the case sent to me every month! This definitely takes the hassle out of going to the store to get it and I think it's set at a great price point. We've been going through our case so fast (we're pretty active) that I've increased my case count to 2 every month!
Pleasant taste...,"Just FYI - This is a light roast coffee and has a pleasant taste to it. It is perfect for a relaxing morning as it does not caffeinate your bloodstream into overdrive but just keeps you mellow and for the afternoon cup of coffee this blend would serve well also.<br /><br />There is a subtle hint of blueberry flavoring - not too overwhelming. If you have it straight up you will enjoy it without any bitter taste. You do find the flavors of the coffee to be there. But then again every one has different taste buds and what I found to be enjoyable, you may find to be a unfavorable taste; but I don't think so. I know you will enjoy this light roasted coffee as it will bring a relative calmness over your soul.<br /><br />If you add a bit of cream (my choice is french vanilla cream), it will prove as a more satisfying taste. Overall a nice cup of coffee."
"Love the taste, not happy with popcorn","I have the 8ounce popcorn machine with kettle. I have used 10 packs of the popcorn out of the 24 pack case. The taste of the popcorn is great, but at least 25% of the popcorn does not pop. The kernel cather is half full of unpopped kernels after each batch. I will try other brands because to Me that is just too much unpopped kernels."
Very good,Very good when prepared as directed. Not too strong and only ten calories. The price is much more reasonable than other similar items.
Watch out for limited expiry dates,LOVE the product.  Was very disappointed that the expiry date was only 9 weeks away.  I thought bulk purchasing was the way to go but there's no way I'd want my 9 month old to get through 12 boxes of these in such a short period of time!  Makes me wary of buying bulk again.
Best Chocolate ever!,"My husband a self-proclaimed chocoholic says this is the best chocolate he's ever eaten.  And because it's so high in cocoa content, it's good for him too!  That's all he needed - another reason to eat chocolate ha! ha!  We bought it in 12-bar packs and gave it out over xmas and everyone agreed...great chocolate!"
Makes AUTHENTIC gumbo is 1/5 the usual time!,"I lived in Louisiana for 15 years before moving to New England, so I've had LOTS of gumbo. Making gumbo from scratch can take as long as 3 hours  from cooking the meat to making the roux and then putting it all together to simmer. But Zatarain's (pronounced Zat-uh-ran's) is my quick solution.<br /><br />Just follow the directions on the box and add 3 stalks of chopped celery and 3-4 chopped green onions (DO NOT use white onion, the taste is completely different and you and your guests will be very sorry...trust me). The resulting gumbo tastes like the real thing from New Orleans. I have made both shrimp gumbo and chicken/sausage gumbo, and both come out great with the few additions I've mentioned. Some people also add a few chopped okra, but not me.<br /><br />HINT (shrimp gumbo): Add cooked shrimp AFTER the gumbo has finished simmering and just before serving. It will taste much fresher.<br />HINT (chicken gumbo): Use a rotisseire chicken from the deli or cook the chicken during the day in a slow cooker while you're at work. Saves lots of time as well.<br /><br />I also like the ""base"" better than the ""mix"" since it allows you to add as much or as little rice as you like to the soup. Also, the ""base"" is better if you want to freeze it. I've found that one box usually feeds 4-5 people since they always go back for seconds."
Pleasant Surprise,"I like trying different teas (primarily non-herbals), and after hearing about Pu-erh I was intriqued.  From what I've read so far, I believe this particular version is not aged like the very high-end, expensive, caked versions are, but it seemed like a good way to get a taste of this tea variety.  I am not disappointed at all.  Though it's not a drastic departure from other teas, it's not quite like any I've had before.  It's very mild and earthy, with a subtle sweetness -- VERY pleasant!<br /><br />Something else that sets it apart from other (non-herbal) teas: It doesn't get bitter after extended steeping!  Furthermore, as I've read elsewhere, just one serving goes a long way.  In fact, I never stop steeping it.  When my cup is almost empty, I just top it off again.  I get at least four flavorful cups with just one of the prewrapped nuggets.<br /><br />This instantly became one of my favorite teas.  I'm delighted I finally discovered it, and just may have to spend the $ to try one of the more expensive/exotic versions.  If it's even better than this, I would understand why folks are willing to pay such a premium $."
Biscuit v cookie,The product has withstood the ravages of time and is a Brit favorite. The product packing was good but the box the seven packs came in was very poorly packed resulting in a 20% breakage
Chicken Nibs,My dog just loves these treats.  They can be used as a training aid or just for a tasty treat.  I give them to my dog as a reward after i brush her teeth.  Brushing her teeth never was easier because she knows what she will get after we are through.
Squeaky clean!!,"I have a one year old Pomeranian whom has been on greenies since she was about 3mos. Let me tell you, I've gone to the vet several times during her first year for different reasons. The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy ""smile"" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word ""greenies"" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container."
Yummy!,"This Planters Creamy Peanut Butter is great.  Very smooth texture and good flavor.  It does seem a little sweet to me but then I usually buy the crunchy kind of peanut butter.  My family also enjoys this, including the granddaughter.  Good buy."
"Not as smooth as I liked, but alright","The mix is alright - the flavor is correct.  However, after I stirred in the hot water, the congee wasn't as smooth and sticky as I usually prefer.  And I put in my usual amount of water (ie. amount I would use for zhi ma hu I'd buy in an asian grocery store).  Overall, it's decent."
Best Coconut Water,"I've tried other coconut waters and nothing compares to the Vita Coco. I can drink 3 or 4 of these a day easily. My favorite is the regular 100% pure coconut water.  The flavor is light, refreshing and gives you a great cooling affect.  My family enjoys this water so much we just purchased 5 cases. Definitely a must have in my house."
Haribo makes the best frogs and bears,"I have only purchased the Haribo Gold Bears in the past, but I decided to give the Frogs a try. Boy was I delighted. The Bears are filled with flavor, and these Frogs also have the same fruitful flavor, only with a layer of the white, marshmallow-like gummi on the belly side of the Frogs. If you have only bought the Bears because you know you can't go wrong with them, you may like something different but not too different like these Mini Frogs by Haribo."
Save yourself a few bucks,If your dogs go thru the shakes when you run out like mine do then you need to stock up. The cheapest price you will find delivered to your home. Better deal than you will ever get in a store.
People Either Love or Hate Valerian!,"I love Valerian and I love it's earthy smell! But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!"
How to be clean AND comfortable,"For someone who lives in a semi-arid high-altitude climate (think Colorado), this product is essential.  And anyone who endures seasonal dry weather should look into this product as well.  I've sworn by Dove products ever since moving to the Denver area in the `70's, and I'm happy that my ""manly man"" can now enjoy these benefits as well.  This body soap has a mild, clean smell - no perfume-y overtones.  If you're a male and experience dry skin at times, this one is for you"
Great tasting Java!,"For those who like their coffee with a stronger bolder taste, this is it. Grinding the fresh beans is the way to go. These have a great taste and were delivered fresh."
great ! !,i used this product on my face along with alba papaya facial mask and it cleared my acne amazingly!! i was so pleased with this product its gental and smells fantastic and i recamend this product to women and men !!
tasty,These almonds just have a great flavor.  Just the right amount of heat.  It's hard to stop eating them.  Good thing my wife is here to stop me.
Kid-tested and convenient,"These fruit squeezes are made only of pear, broccoli, spinach and lemon juice. Given their sweetness, I assume they are primarily pear. However, for a snack that travels well and needs no preparation, they are reasonably healthy. My 2.5 year-old-son really enjoyed this flavor. At first he was a bit thrown off by the odd shape of the package and placement of the straw relative to other fruit squeezes, but he quickly got over it."
most delicious olive oil,I ordered this olive oil after having it at the Gramercy Park Hotel.  It is delicious!  It's light and has no<br />linseed-oilish aftertaste that I find so common in so many other oils I've tried.  The price is good for<br />a virgin olive oil...I highly recommend it.
"On time, great quality",The package arrived on time and was in perfect quality. The wax paper is strong and I like that it is all natural. I'm very happy with the purchase.
DELISH!,This is my favorite brand ever!!!!! I have been eating pancakes about 4 mornings a week since I have discovered their wonderful mixes!!!!!!! YUM YUM! And who doesn't need more whole grains in their diet ???!
Absolutely Awesome,I love jolly rancher lollipops so I thought... Why not get a bunch? Best decision I ever made. I got it in 4 days. I ordered 100 (two orders) and they are AMAZING!!! they are very fresh and yummy. VERY FLAVORFUL! I love the watermelon ones and the pink lemonade. GET IT! really great deal. Totally 100% worth the wait... Im eating one right now! mmmmmmmmmmm... I love love love these!<br /><br />btw the box is kinda flimsy but i keep the two boxes in a drawer so they dont move much. If you want a good box then you should find something to put them in. If the boxes aren't moving (like keeping them in a drawer like I do) then you're good.<br /><br />:)<br />:)<br />:)
Great alternative for sugar,It's a great buy. It tastes sweeter than sugar and has none of the bitterness of Splenda. No complaints at all. Happy with the purchase.
Best Pasta (but poor package cooking directions),"Firstly, I buy Tinky noodles at my grocery for 3.10/package, so the price offered here is not as good.  They are the best noodles when properly cooked - I boil them for 7 minutes then drain and eat.  I like a noodle with some ""chew"" to it and I often reheat leftovers in the microwave (when I plan to do that I cook the noodles for 5 minutes) They will get MUSHY if you cook according to package directions (and who wants that unless you're missing teeth?).  I serve these noodles both hot and cold to family and guests and receive only compliments.  Being gluten-free (choice, not celiac) I also notice they digest far better than pasta, which tends to bloat and expand.  And that means I can eat more, because I love them.  Buy them and cook them right!"
Perfect sauce,"Great transaction, no problems at all.  Would do business with them again.  Have purchased this item before in the large bottles, but haven't been able to find it lately.  Item is wonderful as always!"
Nice smell but a little heavy,I really like the smell of this line of shampoos and conditioners. They leave my hair smelling so fresh and clean and not overly perfumey. I thought this version left my hair heavy and weighted down. Styling was more challenging than usual. I will use this as a weekly deep conditioner and not an every day conditioner.
Slightly Smaller than Average,"Like somebody else wrote on the review, it's more easier to break than plastic trash bags does. But it's not impossible to use... Just need to be a bit careful. Do not let sharp edges touch directly to the bag.<br />And also somebody else wrote on the review, I think this bag is slightly smaller than the average tall kitchen bag. I snag this bag over my kitchen trash can and it comes off from the edge whenever I throw in something heavy. If manufacturer can make this bag a little bit bigger, at least as big as average tall kitchen bag size, I'll give 4 stars to this product."
Great for Finicky Eaters,My daughter absolutely LOVES this cereal. It's hard to find her food she likes since she's such a picky eater and this one was a hit.<br /><br />I hope that the manufacturer keeps this around.
"I grew Wheatgrass that is long, green, lush and NO MOLD!","I have the EZ Green Sprouter.  When I bought mine, I bought the seeds from the same company too.  The cost was a bit pricey so I checked Amazon's.  I went ahead and placed an order for one 5lb.  Granted, I'm not new to growing Wheatgrass, I followed the SAME simple steps but with these new seeds.  I am AMAZED!  Not only do these seeds produce green blades of lush grass, but there is NO mold!  Whereas in the seeds from the EZ Green Sprouter, their seeds grow skinny, light green and moldy wheatgrass.  I love my EZ Green Sprouter, but their seeds cannot even compare to this merchant's!  Normally once my wheatgrass starts to mold, I would have to start cutting them, separate the mold and then extract the juice.  With these seeds?  The grass is still growing even higher than my EZ Green Sprouter and with NO MOLD!  I am so thrilled to have found a product that is a great value and delivers excellent quality.  I am yours for life~!  Thank you!"
My dogs love these!,"I got these for my chihuahuas and all three of them love them! They seem to be easier to chew than rawhide, and I'm not as afraid of them choking! I wish they had more flavors- but I'm sure they will in time!"
Chai Tea,"Big Train Chai Tea is delicious....the packaging is perfect and easy (cannister, large packs or individual single serving packs).  The Vanilla Chai is also very good."
M&M 12.6oz,"This is a great products, kids love it.  Good for cooking!  If you buy them in the store they will cost you quite abit more for a single pack. 6 pack was a good deal."
"Same gum, way more packaging","I like this gum, it gets a 5, but here's my gripe.  For some reason they decided to change the packaging, and the changes are really lame.  This gum used to be packaged in 12 blister packs, each having 12 pieces of gum, each blister pack with a cardboard sleeve.  Now it's 16 blister packs of 9 pieces each, again each with a cardboard sleeve, but two of the sleeved blister packs are stuck together. That's right, way more packaging for the same amount of gum.  The claim is ""now 50% more"" because apparently when you stick two packs with 25% less together, you get 50% more.  Sadly, it's the same 144 pieces of gum, just WAY more packaging.  I hope the marketing agency that convinced Wrigley to do this incredibly stupid, environmentally irresponsible thing is forced to move to a landfill and watch as their offices get inundated by 9 piece blister packs.  The only downside to this scenario is that the process will be a third faster than if they had just left it alone, putting them out of their misery sooner.  By the way, have I mentioned that there's WAY MORE PACKAGING?"
PERFECT,Perfect roast. Not too dark - this coffee is not bitter or acidy like others with darker roast.<br />Perfect espresso. Just like in Italy.
It was ok,"I love Harney & Sons, their Hot Cinammon spice and Chamomile is my favorite.<br /><br />This one was nice and bold, but not for me.  I had to add alot of sugar and it tasted a little burnt/bitter/off for me.<br /><br />Smells good though."
Good pure quality and taste,An excellent pure juice and taste.  Used to make gourmet ice creams and gelatos which all at the Family Reunion truly enjoyed to cap off a great slow smoked meats and bbq feast.  This along with the blueberry and pomegranate pure juices were a great and indispensable asset to make the deserts.  Thank you from the chef and all the family!
The Best Cayenne I have ever used!,"After thorough research, I decided to purchase this Cayenne and this is the best product I have ever used to aid in losing weight and slimming my tummy after birth. I have used it for about 8 months now and still have it in stock. I have recommended it to a number of friends who were wondering how I keep fit. I don't do extreme extreme workouts and don't like them and so Cayenne has really helped me along with  minimal home workouts.<br /><br />Okay this is my story. I had a baby a few years ago. My initial weight was 149 lbs and by the time I was going into the delivery room, I was 226 lbs. After a couple of weeks after having my son, I was stuck at 203lbs. I decided enough was enough and started digging. I used weight loss pills, etc but nothing really worked out. I came to Amazon and started doing my search, going through reviews and researching the internet about several products offered and finally came across this particular Cayenne and this is the best thing that ever happened to my weight loss journey.<br /><br />I started with a quarter of a teaspoon because it was just too hot and I am now using half in food. I use it on my lunch and dinner (I sprinkle a half teaspoon on every meal after cooking (in my plate after serving)).<br /><br />I also drink it twice a day in the morning and in the evening. I take a cup of cold water, squeeze half a lemon in it, then add a teaspoon of cayenne powder in it, stir it and quickly gulp it down.<br /><br />I also work out for about 30 minutes a day, 3 or 4 times a week doing cardio on my treadmill. I also try to eat healthy as much as I can. Eating foods with high fiber, fruits, vegetables, lean meat, etc.<br /><br />Long story short, I am now weighing 140lbs and have stuck to this routine. I would recommend it to anyone especially if you want to lose some pounds and don't like taking pills, or working out too much."
Pam Cookies:,I will never buy Cookies OL again. What I got was 5 boxed of cookie crumbs.Not one full cookie in the shipment.
spicy and tangy!!,"I adore this relish, and have gotten my friends hooked on it too.<br />Dresses up any meal, no artificial ingredients.<br />Try it!<br />Seller packaged box my glass jars poorly and 2 of the jars were leaky, but thankfully not broken when they arrived.<br />Seller gets 3 stars!"
Delicious with vanilla yogurt and frozen blueberries,I was so thrilled to find 'Just Bunches' by Honey Bunches of Oats offered online since I can't find it in stores anymore.  Make sure you realize what size boxes you are purchasing.  These are so small they're almost sample size or something.  These are not the size that you purchased in the store.
Yummy!,"My dog ""flipped"" over her new veggies.  She literally starts licking her lips when I pull out the bag.  These are so healthy and wonderful for my Maya; she can't wait to start chomping.  I like the fact that they are a blend of very satisfying vegetables.  Using it with her kibble ensures me she is eating the right mix!  BTW, it helps her digestive system!"
The taste gets sickening after awhile,"I don't know if the St. John's Wort herb tastes really bad or something, but this tea definitely covers up the taste. It tastes really licorice-y, it's like a slightly milder version of their Egyptian licorice tea. You can somewhat taste the other spices like cardamom, but the strong licorice taste got to me after awhile and I really did not like it. But if you love licorice tea, then I'm sure you'd like it.<br /><br />I decided to edit this review, since not everyone though it was helpful. Ok, first of all, I mention the licorice part because, well, if you know your herbs, licorice is also good for heart burn, but has the side effect of being a mild laxative. As for the St. John's Wort herb part: the herb is not too strong in Yogi's tea, and I prefer to use pure St. John's Wort from Alvita. Yes, it taste awful and I have to put a teaspoon of honey for half a cup of tea, but it works for me (I use 2 dosages and 4 pills of Enzymatic Therapy St. John's Wort pills because I can't drink that many cups of this herb with its taste. But the tea is more effective for me--I think my body absorbs it better in a natural form, which is normal for vitamins). And another note: just like perscription medication, this does not work in an instant. For me, it takes about a week to truely get the effects. My review is for people who decide to do alterative therapy who are diagnosed with mild to moderate depression."
Soothing tobacco tea with almonds to munch!,"This is one of those tobacco teas that some people dislike, unlike them, I tremendously enjoy the aroma of fine African rooibos red tea with slight vanilla hint, and 1 or 2 hiding pieces of almonds at the bottom of the cup when I am done.  It's good to drink at anytime of the day, but I prefer it after 5 PM or later as it has no caffeine, the rest of teas I drink contain some traces of caffeine (green, white) which I leave for the second part of the day.  Rooibos tea is a fantastic tea containing full arsenal of antioxidants, protects the liver, fights viruses and has many other medicinal properties.  I am finishing my jars of loose green tea and won't come back to it because of caffeine (even small traces of caffeine is really a light carcinogen, I bet you didn't know! :) ).  In reality, herbal teas like rooibos, chamomile, st. john's wort, hibiscus, Melissa (lemon balm) etc, beat green and white teas, and are some of the finest teas that fight viruses, bacteria, HIV, hepatitis, herpes infections (HSV 1 and 2), protect the liver, normalize several blood values decrease lipoperoxidation, increase antioxidant defenses, etc. (hibiscus for example decreases oxalic acid (stone) formation in kidneys). So herbal teas are your friends, treat them with boiling water and they will take care of you with time.  Another great idea, if you are adventurous, is to mix several herbal teas together to have a synergistic effect."
Great easy cake mix for the allergic or vegan!,"We wouldn't survive without these mixes!  We chose them because they're vegan, but the fact that they're nut free is a bonus after a friend's son developed a nut allergy.  When I need to make cupcakes last minute, it's great  to have an easy mix to use in my busy schedule.  They come out perfect EVERY time.  I made 2 batches (one vanilla, one chocolate) for a bake sale recently and they were the first things that sold out.  Non-vegan nor allergic folks declared them delicious.  I've even 'doctored' the mixes to add flavors for more 'gourmet' cupcakes...like a little strong coffee in the chocolate mix makes a great mocha cupcake.  Lemon juice and rind in the vanilla makes a delicious lemon cupcake.  I highly recommend these mixes to anyone who's got a nut allergy or can't/doesn't eat eggs or dairy (or soy).  Cherrybrook Kitchen is this vegan working mom's hero!"
Wonderful,"This was a great treat. I got it as a gift for family with two young labs and it was so interesting for all of us to see how interested they were. The more 'biddable' bitch was attracted, but the more 'rambunctious' male stayed nosing and chewing at different angles until he discovered how to lift the cups and get to the treats inside. He quickly became an expert and was easily lifting and dropping the cups, while his friend stayed close and occasionally sneaked a treat out before her could get to it. Don't leave the dogs to play with the cups, or they'll chew them out of shape and they won't lift out as easily. Great fun and gave us a better understanding of the dogs."
Nettle Leaf Tea,"If I can't find this at my local market or in a near by store, I order it from Amazon. I drink this tea after a night of drinking alcohol in order to help cleanse my liver."
My Favorite Snack,"My family loves Popcorners and the kettle variety has become our favorite movie snack. We think it tastes even better than actual kettle corn.  The serving sizes are fairly small so one bag doesn't go far.  At only 100 calories per serving it is a great, healthy snack. These have become a staple in our gluten free household."
yummy!,Sweet potato popchips are awesome!  They're a little like a kettle corn where you have the salty and the sweet.  Yummy!
Delicious anytime granola,"We needed a nut-free and peanut-free granola. Since we enjoyed other Bob's Red Mill products, we decided to try this one. Yummy! This is a granola that's not just for breakfast. It's good as a snack or a mix-in. It's sweet, but that comes from all natural ingredients. It's a nice feeling reading a label with words I can pronounce and recognize."
Mars bars,"Bought the Mars bars for my father who loves them, but have been unable to find them any where.  He was afraid they were not the same as what he had in the past, but was very happy to find that they were!  Thank you for making my father very happy!"
The foil inside is not tighly sealed,"The two bottles were packed tightly. When I opened the tight packing and open the bottles, the foils inside were not tightly sealed. One bottle were the liquid spilled out and the other bottle the foil was not even ""glued"" to the mouth of the bottle. Will not buy this product anymore due to unreliable packing and who knows the producta could have been tampered."
prompt and fresh,"the candy arrived before the estimated date, and in good shape. we have experienced some  problems with bulk candy bags arriving in ""popped"" condition, not so this delivery. i will deffinitely reorder from this vendor again."
Yum! Yum!,I have not been able to find ribbon candy in the stores for a while now.  After seeing this being made on a TV show I ordered it immediately and it arrived at my daughters in 3 days in time for Christmas.  It was better than expected.  Very colorful and very thin.  A Christmas treat from the past.
"Yes, there is a bitter aftertaste!","I got so excited when I saw this and people were saying that it is basically Splenda without the aftertaste. When it came, I couldn't wait to try it in iced tea. Well, it has a raging aftertaste. Disgusting. I would not recommend this product. I consider that I wasted my money. I gave it two stars because it does sweeten, but I was tempted to give it one star.<br /><br />Maybe there will come a sucralose substitute that will get rid of the bitter aftertaste, but this is not it."
My College-Age Daughter Loves Soup at Hand!,"My daughter is a college freshman, and just a few months into the school year she is complaining long and loud about the dining hall food. We've always liked Soup At Hand for a quick, light snack or meal with decent nutritional value. So now, as an Amazon Prime member, I can send it by the case to my daughter with no shipping charges. AWESOME deal!"
yummy treat with less mess,my 10mo daughter loves these little puffs. and i love that they just melt in her mouth and it doesnt make much crumbs. will buy this again.
So yummy,Wow this stuff is good! Almost every single kernel popped every time! It was flavorful and pretty. I would totally order it again. I loved it!
Didn't like this one...,"This one was a no way for my cat.  Don't know why either since he's mister turkey and loves all the other Friskies turkey varieties.  He jumped away from the bowl for some reason - quite funny though!  Keep in mind he's a Persian too so yours might not be as fussy.  The chicken and turkey variety seems to be more palatable for him so if you're looking for a good one with which to start, I'd recommend that one first.  Recommend because of the quality, but be sure of your cat's tastes prior to purchasing because of the price."
fantastic brew,"I love the Emeril's Big Bold K cups.I get my money's worth from them .My brother likes it straight ,<br />I like it a little weaker ,so I can get 2 cups out of it,saves me $$$$,when I get them on special at Amazon."
Nylabones,"Product came quicker than expected. My dogs love them!! Having Great Danes, I need something they can't chew through immediately!  This fits the bill."
greatttt!!!!!!!!,"These mi goreng barbecue noodles are good,they have a nice taste to them... luv em im odering more its worth your money!!!!!"
Developed problems after couple weeks,"I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken).  I have to say, I am really disappointed with this dog food. Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies). I noticed the chicken formula is back on the market and I will for sure be switching."
"Love the product, but not too great shipped from Amazon","I Like the ThinkThin products and had good luck with a shipment of the peanut butter ones, but these brownie crunch ones arrived in poor condition. From my best guess it looks like they were stored someplace that was hot enough for their chocolate coating to melt. Each one is splotched with white, the chocolate is brittle and flakes off immediately and bears imprints of the outer wrapper, exactly as if they had melted and then re-solidified. They need to be stored someplace much cooler. They tasted fine, but were a huge mess and very unappealing to look at."
One of my favorite,"If you cannot do it, or do not have the time, then I would have to agree with a number of other reviewers here that this is by far the best black or dark tea that comes in bag form.  It is the one I use early in the morning when I am in a hurry.  It has a great kick to it and feeds my caffeine addiction wonderfully.  Now don't take me wrong, I love coffee too and certainly drink my share of the stuff, but coffee will never replace a good cup of tea in my book.  This is also the tea I take with me on camping trips and backpacking trips; a time when you really need a kick in the tail to get you going and keep you going.  The flavor is excellent.  In the morning I use a bit of honey and cream in mine..to each his own taste, huh.  Twinings makes a good product and this is some of their best."
Jacobs instant,Sent Jacobs instant coffee as a gift to mother and sister since they enjoy this brand instant best.  It is very aromatic and tastes like brewed coffee.
Burnt taste and shelf life short or used up,"I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away."
"Smells Aweful, but Jimmy Loves It",I can't stand the smell of this treat.  They are very bite-sized (tiny little beads).  I wouldn't mind them so much if they smelled a little better.  As it stands I can't be near the opened bag without getting naseous.  My daughter feeds him treats now.
Wonderful coffee!,This is the BEST French Roast coffee from all of the different K-Cups that I have tried!<br />You must try these!
highly recommend,My 10-yr old Golden Retriever had been having arthritis problems in his front leg. He's been on the Healthy Motion chewables for about a month now and I've seen a noticable difference. No limping and an extra pep in his step! I highly recommend this product for senior pets!
Great product and fast delivery!,My kitten loves the food and it was here before we knew it! It does take a little bit to prepare the food but it is well worth it.
Really fun and well made!,"These are well made, with nice crisp shapes.  I had a hard time envisioning how much volume 3 lbs represented, so if this helps anyone...these completely filled an 8 x 5 x 3 inch box.  I had enough to give a generous amount (maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup) in each of 12 goodie bags.  And if anyone is looking for ideas, I put these in flat white bakery bags, folded the tops down and then printed a little round label with a picture of lego blocks to seal them."
Coffee on the Lighter Side,"This coffee is for those of you who like smooth, light roast coffee.  If you don't care for light roast, this coffee is not for you."
Great Company - Hi Quality Ingredients,"I've ordered from this company a few times.  If I remember correctly the orders were for dates and various types of nuts.  All ingredients have been fresh and tasty.  Highly recommend their Brazil nuts, sesame seeds, almonds, and dates.  Enjoy!"
Newman's own Organics Decaf Cups,"newman's Own Organics Special Decaf hasGreat flavor,not bitter at all.Excellent! Would definitely order again.Wish price was a little less pricey."
Amazing transformation for allergic golden,"I've been feeding my nine year-old golden retriever Sojos for the past eight weeks (nine weeks if you include the transition period).  He's had so many positive changes that I wanted to write a review.  In the interest of fair disclosure, I have also added the following supplements to Teddy's food (starting at the same time I started Sojos): apple cider vinegar, salmon oil, a probiotic, and Dr. Pritcairn's ""Healthy Powder"" (nutritional yeast, lecithin granules, kelp powder, bone meal and vitamin C).  Given that the biggest change was the food, I'm giving most of the credit to Sojos, although I do believe the supplements are helping.  Here are the changes I've noticed:<br /><br />1. Minimal evidence of allergies.  Teddy has been highly allergic to pollens since he was tested at 18 months old.  I now believe he's also been allergic to some grains.  He has been on extremely expensive allergy pills and shots for years, which I've been able to discontinue with no trouble.  He has also been highly susceptible to nasty hot spots in the last few years (three occurrences in the last 8 months alone) and regularly had eye and ear infections.  He would also lick and chew his paws like crazy every day, to the point of tearing his paw pads.  I haven't seen him lick his paws for two weeks, the fur between the paw pads are no longer stained with saliva, and his ears are a nice flesh color (instead of their usual bright pink color).  I am so happy to see him comfortable, for once!<br /><br />2. Awesome weight loss.  In July he was 87 lbs (typical weight for him), but today (October 1st) he weighed 73 lbs (!!!!) when I took him to the groomer.  His highest weight was over 90 lbs.<br /><br />3. Increased energy and mobility. He has started acting more like a puppy again--zipping around the backyard like he's chasing some imaginary animal. :-  He was diagnosed with arthritis in one of his front elbows last December and has been on strong pain meds (he couldn't tolerate the NSAIDs).  I've dropped his pain meds to half the original dose and he's hopping up into our SUV with ease.<br /><br />4.  Fewer eye ""goobers"" and cleaner teeth.<br /><br />5.  Improved digestion and elimination.  No more rumbling stomach or stinky bombs.  Virtually no pee burn-stains on the lawn.  His poops are half the size, firm instead of runny, and have 80% less smell.  What's not to like about that?! LOL<br /><br />I love the convenience of the Sojos Complete and plan to try the beef flavor soon.  I've been very reluctant to try any variation of a raw diet for Teddy because I'm a vegetarian, so I *really* appreciate not having to prepare raw meat!  Although I initially purchased Sojos from Amazon, I have found it $18 cheaper per bag elsewhere.  It's not cheap to feed a large dog, but I am saving so much money in reduced vet visits and other medications (not to mention a happy, healthy dog), that the extra cost is well worth it!  Teddy eats his food with gusto, instead of begrudgingly.  I love my ""new"" happy, healthy dog!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/14/12: Teddy (who just turned 10) is now down to a healthy 61 lbs and is still doing very well.  He did have another small hot spot on his tail two months ago, but otherwise his allergies are still well under control, he has tons of energy, and we're thrilled with the weight loss.  I've used the beef flavor on occasion to mix things up, but Teddy's preference seems to be for the turkey.  I do hope Sojos will continue to come out with new varieties of the complete mixes."
Great breakfast!,"These oatmeal cups are great for the working person!  They're very convenient, taste great, and better than any drive-thru fast food breakfast! I keep them in the office for those days that I'm running late and have no time to eat.  I think they're a little pricy, but I guess we're paying for the convenience :)"
"Great taste, but the packaging is strange to me.","The coffee has a very nice, chocolaty taste, very smooth, but the drawback was the packaging.  It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.  I called it chocolaty before, but maybe it's more like a mild cocoa flavor, slightly almond.  Very smooth and not at all bitter.  Great!"
5 star rating,"I would truly recommend this brand to anyone with a cat. My cat had a ton of problems - from vomitting to diarrhea and really smelly poop. Not only did this solve all those issues, but he now has the most silkiest, softest, shiniest fur. The quantity of food intake has also decreased. No more begging for food every 5 minutes. Another bonus - my cat now has a lean and toned body that I'm envious of.<br />This product will save you a lot of trips to the vet!!!"
Yummy Energy Candy That You Can Easily Carry With You,"Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramel ""drops"" are really more like candy. They are hard and rectangular. The outside candy has a nice caramel taste. The inside is a gooey, liquid and delicious honey. They are really tasty and I found that they did give me a decent amount of energy and did not make me jittery. I tested these drops out on a day when I only had two hours of sleep. I had one drop in the morning and one a few hours later. The only caffeine I had was in the form of some diet tea. They definitely helped me to stay awake.<br /><br />One package contains 9 ""drops"". While the serving size is 1 piece, three drops equal 100% of your daily value of Vitamins B6, B12 and C. While this may be a great way to get your vitamins and energy, they do have a down side. Each piece contains 5gm of Carbs and 5gm of Sugar. I really hope that they make a sugar free version of these in the future because they are great other than this. The drops are also caffeine free.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, Corn Syrup, Milk, Honey, Butter, Natural Flavors, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C. **PLEASE NOTE THESE DROPS CONTAIN MILK. IF YOU ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM**<br /><br />I love that I can toss these into my purse and have something with me that will really give me energy. As long as the carbs and sugar are not an issue for you, I highly recommend them. One pack will last you 3-9 days depending on how often you take them, at the current Amazon price (10/25/11), they are a little over $1.15 for a pack of 9.

Great Accent!,"While I can't comment on the shelf life of this particular oil like other users, the flavor is rich enough when you need it and it's a great value!"
good,I love these.  They taste a lot better than the Kraft Mac and Cheese cups I had been buying.  The noodles have a good texture they ares much cheesier and not just watery cheese sauce like those are.  Great for a quick lunch with tuna!
Disappointed,Received my order today and notice the expiration date ....product was produced 2 years ago and expires in a little over 30 days. Seriously? Not pleased.
"More like ""human"" food than Cat Food","My cats are crazy for this food, including the one that has turned up her nose at all wet food for 6 years! Unfortunately the price makes it prohibitive as an every day meal since I have 5 cats. Also, I've heard that too much fish is not healthy for cats, they need meat too and they aren't that crazy about the Petite Cuisine Chicken.  I still buy the tuna and just feed it occasionally as an extra treat. The food itself looks and smells just like tuna for humans, maybe even a little better. Some of it has tiny little (whole) shrimp and some pieces of codfish - it also has a lot of tuna oil, which I guess is what the cats like about it because the first thing they do is lap up all the ""gravy"". I thought maybe if I bought human tuna in oil and spiked their usual soft Friskies, they would enjoy it more, but that didn't work, so I continue to buy Petite Cuisine."
great cookies,"these cookies are delicious, you really can't go wrong with any of the pamela's products, we have not found any that we did not like"
All Salt and MSG,"I returned this product immediately.  First 2 ingredients were Salt and Monosodium Glutamate.  The website portrays the product as Bonito Fish and Seaweed soup stock - I couldn't find the ingredient list - so mistakenly trusted the discription. I planned to use the product as the base for Miso Soup, a healthy food - it would certainly defeat the purpose to use this product!!"
YUM.,"I've always, ALWAYS loved Skittles! They are sweet and chewy, and they will give you plenty of cavities if you're not careful! ^_^<br /><br />Enjoy them, and buy this 3.5 lb bag today!<br /><br />4.5 stars."
"Very Good Maple Taste, reminds me of maple syrup time in PA","We had these cookies in Victoria, BC; I wanted to get more for gifts from our trip to Canada but forgot about it.  When I got home Amazon had them and I was able to give them as gifts as planned."
Fantastic Toy!,"This toy has saved my sanity and my furniture!  Instead of my puppy chewing the furniture, he chews on this toy instead.  My puppy, who usually tires of toys in a day, has had this one for over a month and it is still the first toy he goes to each morning and the last toy he plays with before going to bed at night.  It took him an entire week of daily, constant chewing to just get through one of these cookies and when he did, he was very excited and pleased with himself!  Once he finished that one cookie, he went on the attack the second one.  I also put treats inside the ball, under the cookies and my dog loves trying to get through one cookie just to get to the treats inside.  I have never seen a cookie as hard and sturdy as these are and my dog loves every flavor he has tried so far.  I highly recommend this toy!  It has kept my active, hyper puppy amused, occupied and happy, every day.  I can not say enough good things about this toy, which is good for puppies and older dogs alike.  The only problem I have found is trying to keep enough of the cookie refills stocked in my home.  I wouldn't dream of running out of the cookie refills  for this toy !"
Well worth the money,The hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. I find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa.  The best bang for the buck I have so far found for hot cocoa.  I tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.
Absolutely Delicious,I just received my order of Tophe Rice Bran Oil and the taste is phenomenal.  This will be the only that I will be using in the future.  The Customer Service Dept at Honest Foods are exceptional and courteous.  They extend excellent service in any discrepancy that may arise.  I will be a future Honest Food customer.  A Happy Customer
Taste does not match the price,"For as expensive as this is, it's kind of a disappointment. There is no ""wow"" factor in this kona coffee. It was just OK, not what I expected for the price I paid. Never again will I pay this much for something I have not sampled."
A good assortment of decaf k-cups,I was really pleased with this selection of decaf k-cups.  I bought this as a gift for someone to help them pick a decaf k-cup that they would like.  It turns out that they liked the sample better than picking one!  The product came with a good selection of coffee types.  I was happy I ordered it.
5 pounds!!!,There is no way you can go wrong. You buy this bag and you have all the fun in the world while you are at home or on the road. They are the perfect balance of sweetness and gumminess (yea it's not a word but who cares)!! Haribo makes the best gummi bears on the planet. I won't eat any other gummi bear.
EXCELLENT!,"This is an excellent addition to any chef/cooks kitchen, as my husbaqnd is a chef and I am a baker, we find many excellent uses for it!! Yes, it is hard to find, but this price is reasonable to the prices I've found it for in the Korean markets. Yuzu is SO flavorful (truly something you have to taste for yourself to believe!), a very nice, pure and clean citrus flavor withouit any of the bitterness! Great with seafoods, crab cakes, desserts, etc! Substitute it for lemon juice in any recipe and the flavor is a tremendous difference! Please give this a try!! Just a note, if you store in the top/back of fridge, it does seem to freeze easily, so beware!"
good product...customer service is poor,the coffee is good. but I've been trying to cancel the auto shipments but its impossible to find any way for customer service to help. therefore they continue sending it and I have to keep sending it back.
tasty,"tasty and soft.  my toddler just loves them.  they are a little pricey, and there are very few fruit snacks in a bag."
Dog ate toy,I got this toy for my 8 mo old pit bull.She took the chew thing out and chewed the ball up.
A Nice Way To Level Off,"I've tried quite a few energy drinks, mints and pills and have favorites in each area.  5-Hour Energy isn't my personal favorite as far as energy drinks go, but it is quite exceptional.  When I tried 5-Hour Energy, the first thing that I noticed was that I noticed nothing at all.  I gradually became more alert and less tired, but not once did I experience the jitters, a fast heart rate or any of the other side effects some claim to have experienced here.  What I did feel was what I feel like after having had a restful night's sleep.  I wasn't going to run a marathon at full speed, but I wasn't going to zone out for the rest of the day either.  I remained awake and alert for roughly seven hours, so the five hour claim might just be an estimate.  Either way, when it was time for bed, I had no problem going to sleep and absolutely ZERO crash effects.<br /><br />The only negative aspect of this drink is the taste.  It's somewhat medicinal, but pretty much all energy drinks have a medicinal taste in my opinion.<br /><br />If you want something to ""take it up a notch"" while working out or doing hard physical labor, 5-Hour Energy might not be for you.  However, if you want a few steady, alert hours minus the jitters, 5-Hour Energy is the perfect choice."
Great for iced tea!,"Great berry flavor to this tea. The fruity flavor survives the brewing nicely.<br /><br />I make iced tea using half this and half Black Currant Twinnings tea (also sold on Amazon.com), and that creates the perfect blend when I'm in the mood for something sweeter. Give it a try!"
Right on time,It came right when it was supposed to. Well packaged. Nearly half the price I normally pay at retail stores.
Very Nice Olive Oil,"We really love this olive oil in our household and have taken to purchasing it on the subscription plan.  We have found this olive oil so tasty and versatile that we use it for everything.  (Well, almost.  I insist on using real butter for my chocolate chip cookies)  Its color is a pleasing light yellow-gold with a hint of green.  It is of very consistent quality batch-to-batch and is better and less expensive than what I can find locally.  The taste is smooth and fruity with no bitterness, but mild enough to use as a substitute for butter in most recipes.<br /><br />It is good enough to stand alone with some good french bread and aged balsamic vinegar but inexpensive enough that we use it for all our cooking and sauces.  I like the fact that it comes in a tin that is attractive enough to leave on the kitchen counter and it also protects the contents from light.  the pull out pouring spout meters the oil well and prevents most drips.<br /><br />This presents a very nice balance between quality and price.  There may be better olive oils out there, and certainly less expensive ones, but this one hits the sweet spot between quality and value."
"Easy, fast, and delicious","I'm always on the lookout for lunches I can take to work and store several in my desk without refrigeration, but that don't taste like pre-prepared food.  This Barilla pasta fits the bill perfectly.  The pasta is already cooked to perfection, and it is stored separately from the sauce, so you don't end up with a watery mess like some competitor products.  The sauce is flavorful enough to be interesting without being overwhelming.  It's a filling meal that is definitely staying on my shopping list."
"Excellent coffee, bad k-cups","The coffee tastes great.  It's bold enough flavor wise without any bitterness.  However, we have an explosion with about every other k-cup.  The foil seal on the top breaks and coffee and grounds spew out the top.  Wouldn't be surprised if shipping in the summer heat weakened the adhesive that seals the foil.  I'd buy it again because I like the coffee so much, but be prepared to clean up messes if you get a batch of k-cups like we did."
Healthier and better tasting!,"Best breakfast bar around!  Not sure why you can't find these in any of the local stores anymore, but I am SO glad that they are still available at Amazon.<br /><br />These are not only delicious but have less sugar and more nutrients than the vast majority of the other breakfast/cereal bars.<br /><br />Healthier and better tasting.  You can't beat that!"
Delicious sweet snack,"A little too sweet sometimes, but a great, allergen-free cereal bar. Also perfect for little hands, so I share this bar with both my 5-year old and my 1-year old. yummy! Just be sure to have a glass of water near by, these are very dense bars."
"Delicious, nutritious but too expensive-itious","I am completely and totally hooked on glaceau vitamin water zero, especially this particular flavor, acai-blueberry-pomegranate XXX and recommend it highly. It is very tasty, and nutritionally has the following:<br /><br />100% of daily requirements for vitamin c<br />100% for vitamin B5, B6, B12<br />25% for vitamin A<br />100% for niacin<br />100% for pantothenic acid<br />manganese, vitamin B3, magnesium and antioxidant minerals<br />There are few if any preservatives.<br /><br />It's also ZERO calories and flavored with stevia, a natural sweetener, supposedly less questionable healthwise than sucralose/splenda or other artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I've tried about six flavors of glaceau vitamin water zero XXX (note that it looks  almost the same as glaceau vitamin water and glaceau vitamin water XXX so pay attention to the label) and acai-blueberry-pomegranate is by far my favorite, followed by dragonfruit and fruitpunch. I don't care too much for the lemonade one - it's too sweet. But then again I like to eat lemons whole and never put sugar in lemonade.<br /><br />The red-fruity vitamin water zeros are sweet but not overly sweet.<br /><br />In regard to the price, yes, it is over-priced here, especially when you add shipping costs. In my own local environment (near Boston), about five supermarkets and grocery stores near me carry it, at prices ranging from 99 cents per bottle to 3 bottles for $4 to (at pricey convenience stores) $1.99 a bottle. Given that I drink three bottles a day, the latter is too expensive. So basically I buy it in bulk at the lowest price, and dilute it to make it last longer. It's still tasty when you add a considerable amount of water to it.<br /><br />At the moment, Amazon does have a listing priced at 99 cents a bottle, and with free shipping for orders over $25, but it's only for the lemonade flavor.<br /><br />Since there are many electrolyte-type waters out there that are not very tasty, have limited nutritional value, a lot of preservatives and sometimes a hefty amount of calories - do yourself a favor at try glaceau vitamin water zero. However if buying at Amazon, do a search for all of them listed to find the best price and best shipping deal."
Love these!,"As another reviewer pointed out, these are great alone by the handful as a quick snack but also great for a morning cereal.  (or any other time you may want to eat a bowl of cereal, or course!)<br /><br />The squares are smaller than I had expected, but actually a prefect size - not too big and not too small.  They soften while sitting in milk, of course, but stay crunchy enough so that they are not all mushy by the time I get to the end of the bowl.  They also are not too sweet.  ""hint of brown sugar"" is a very accurate description.  You really don't need to add any sugar to these, they are great on their own and with milk.  (I actually eat them with vanilla almond milk rather than dairy).<br /><br />The fact that they have whole grains in them, 6 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber make them even more appealing to me.  One cup (serving size) of Quaker Oatmeal Squares with 1/2 cup of almond milk is just 255 calories.  this is a great way to start the day and fills me up as well.  I may try adding strawberries or bananas into the bowl for additional goodness!<br /><br />And yes, I plan to try the other flavors as well.  yum!"
The New Improved Coke - chapter 2?,When will they learn - if it's a long standing product with a loyal fan base - changing the recipe is NOT a great idea?!<br />If you want a NEW product - create one.  But they have removed a great deal of the vitamins and nutrition - which was what had me drinking it.  Now I might as well just add hershey's syrup.  Not what I'm after!<br />They have lost a loyal customer here.
Great anytime of the year,"Being from Pennsylvania, I grew up with these.  They are the best Irish Potato candy that you can buy.  These are the coconut fondant type.  Not many people realize that there are two basic types of this candy.  This kind, fondant, and one actually made from potatos.  Around St. Patrick's day, the stores are full of Oh Ryan's.<br /><br />As I have gotten older, I have started to make my own Irish Potatos, and homemade are always a little better than store bought.  I guess because there is that element of love that you can't buy.  But if you are not kitchen inclined, or if you have no idea what they should taste and look like, you can not go wrong buying Oh Ryan's.<br /><br />In cast you weren't aware, these candies have become a tradition at St. Patrick's day in order to remember the struggle of those who went through and those who died during the Irish Potato Famine of the 19th century.  Make sure that you talk to your kids about the Potato Famine and its impact on the Irish people and how it changed the United States."
Freshly grated nutmeg,Great stuff to have in the kitchen.<br />Good delivery.  Would buy again.
My Cat loves this stuff...,"My 13-year old male cat has been a non-fish eater his whole life. I decided to upgrade the quality of his food and bought a sample pack of Tiki Cat. He went wild. There is quite a variety and he favored some much more than others. But the best way to find out is get a sample pack and see what he/she likes.<br />Theres a variety of tuna combinations, calimari, sardines, mackeral, lobster and crab. The fish is very fresh and apparently fished in low mercury oceans so you can relax about the amount you feed your kitty.<br />Our cat now demands fish nearly every day. We still feed him other high-quality cat foods, but most of the time...it's Tiki."
boys love em,I have two boys in boarding school and I sent them each the Nong shim noodle bowls.  they Love them and can't wait for me to send more
"Strong and bold flavor, fits in Philips Senseo machines, and it is organic!","We are still on our first box of this, but so far we love this coffee at home. We have a Senseo coffee machine, and we were unsure if it would work for us, but it fits perfectly. The coffee is organic, no artificial ingredients like some of the other ones have (including the ones recommended by Philips!) Size wise, each coffee pod is quite thick, I would equate it to 1.5 times the Senseo ones. Smells and tastes great. I am not the biggest coffee drinker, but the ladies in the house love it.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
Taste great and very healthy,"All of these bars lack the toxic substances that often trigger headaches/migraines (e.g gluten). They taste excellent, provide a great amount of nutrition and antioxidants. I highly recommend this product, and will certainly be adding them to my to overall healthy diet. You will not be sorry if you purchase this product."
good coffee,"My husband really likes this coffee, It leaves no bitter aftertaste, not overly strong flavor-nice medium balance. Good choice for any time of day, especially since it's decaf."
great cookie,I am a fan of Walkers plain shortbread cookies. Decided to try these when they were on sale and these are outstanding chocolate chip cookies. I like the small packages with two in them because I can have portion control. They would fit nicely in a lunch bag and would be a great morning or afternoon pick-me-up.
great food,Love the product but wish you could change the re-occuring ship date!!!  I have to cancel and reorder<br />annoying problem
Tasty!,"I originally purchased these to use as a fun gift for a 'secret sister,' and happened to be starving when they arrived in the mail today.  The crackers, cheese spread, and pepperoni were incredibly tasty!  The dried fruit complimented the trio well and the chocolate toffee was a perfect top-off.  I immediately got online to order another variety to try!  It seems like a small meal, but it has kept me full all afternoon.  I'm going to package two in a gift basket along with a bottled drink and some napkins--seems a napkin is the one thing the GoPicnic folks forgot!  They'll be perfect for an early fall afternoon in the park.  Hope the other 5 meals will make it to the gift wrapping stage!"
Bags O' Salt with chips added.,"I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.<br />One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.<br /><br />We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.<br /><br />Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.<br /><br />We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.<br />These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique."
Almost Inedible,I'm not a picky eater but these protein bars (creamy peanut butter flavor) are horrible. They smell bad too and your breath smells bad after you mangage to choke one down.
Glenfarclas 25 is the sweet floral sherried heart of Speyside pushed to the limit in the wood.,"When most people picture ""scotch whiskey"" as an archetype they are thinking of a malt sweet spirit with a floral sherried nose, a golden yellow color, and some oak in the finish.  Blends such as Johnny Walker and Chivas mix many malts (and varying amounts of spirit fillers to get at this ideal with clock-like consistency.  There are a number of pure single malts that embody this ideal, from Macallan to Glenlivet.  Most tend to be Speyside malts.  The limpid marble waters and sweet grain of the region exemplify scotch whiskey.  None, however nails the archetype's lightness, floral sweetness, and consistent mix of attributes more or more consistently than Glenfarclas.  Glenfarclas has an extensive line from moderately young to extremely old that are all clear kin and utterly archetypical Speyside scotch - every single one.  The sweet heart of the line are the 17 (perfect) and 21 (just a kiss older and richer than perfect) year old expressions.  Today I'm drinking the 25 year expression.  Is it gilding the lilly?  Does the extra age ruin the magic with too much wood or is it even a scooch better yet?<br /><br />Color: Light amber gold.  Just like ""scotch"" looks in the dictionary picture.<br /><br />Nose is Sweet vanilla sherry - simple ""Scotch"" - increasingly rich with time.  Toffee malt richness turns the aroma ambrosial with time (lots of time) in the glass.<br /><br />Light mouthfeel.  The entry is mostly sweet with straight malt sugars.  Expansion is broad but light and floral with vanilla from oak tannins which bring a pepperiness and a dryness in the texture.  Sherry and nougat and cake frosting flavors round into red fruits (cherry and red plum) as the midpalate blooms into honeyed splendor.  Finish is sweet turning tannin dry with a long tail of vanilla and honeysuckle and citrus (tangerine) that ends on a slightly bitter note.<br /><br />This is clearly kissing cousins with the 21 but there is a little more of everything... including that bitterness at the end.  Personally I'd stand pat with the 21, but I can see why the distiller pushed it.  There is definitely a perspective that the 25 delivers that is valid and delicious - just I feel the balance of attributes is best with the 21.  You might feel differently.  None of these Glenfarclases are big intense flavors.  All are gentle, sweet, and polite.  It's what Chivas dreams of when it dreams of scotch."
What a relief!,"At these prices, I saved over $1.50 a box.  Getting 6 boxes at a time, that's quite a chunk! Reasonable turnaround time."
Perfect Morning Tea (Caffeinated),"*****<br />Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf.""<br /><br />Although this tea says ""orange pekoe"", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the ""old stuff""!<br />*****"
Delicate and delightful,"I love biscotti and I always keep an eye out for new bicotti to try.  I found this on Amazon while doing a search and have to admit that the packaging really caught my eye, and the ingredients (hazelnut, orange zest, and olive oil) intrigued me.  My three boxes arrived yesterday and I couldn't make a cup of coffee fast enough to try these with.<br /><br />They did not disappoint!  In fact, they are divine.  They have a delicate hazelnut flavor with a dash of exciting orange zest that aren't lost when dunked in coffee. They're also not too sweet, they're just right.  They are the small-sized biscotti (a bit bigger than a man's thumb) and have a nice texture that is different from your typical super-hard crunchy biscotti (they have a smoothness that I'm guessing is the olive oil).<br /><br />These are an indulgent treat that I'd feel proud to serve to friends with coffee or tea.  I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors."
Great training treat,"This is the best training treat I've come across.  I have pomeranian puppies and they have trained so nicely with this treat.  I cut the treat into smaller bite size pieces for them.  When I say, ""come"", they run as fast as they can to me!  It's also nice because you can hide a few pieces of it in their kong toy with food a mealtime.  That keeps them entertained while you eat!  It doesn't smell bad and keeps easily.  They just love it."
White Coffee Kahlua French Vanilla Gourmet Ground,"White Coffee Kahlua French Vanilla Gourmet Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2) purchased this item at Amazon<br />is very good i am very happy for this product and price"
"Great product, too bad I wasn't sent the correct kind.","These chips are excellent! They stopped carrying them at my local Costco, but I was so happy to find them here!<br /><br />I guess they ran out of the plain kind because it said they were available when I ordered them... they are listed on my order sheet and Amazon invoice as ""Original""... and lo and behold, I received ""Sea Salt and Vinegar"", not ""Original"".<br /><br />Still a good product, but wish I had a courtesy e-mail or something to tell me they ran out of ""Original"". I'm not a huge fan of salt/vinegar chips, but at least it keeps me from eating them quickly (it lets me nibble)."
I like it...,"I have read some unflattering reviews, but I am pleased.  I have used this in an iced tea maker and in a french press with great results.  Granted, this isn't my grandmother's tea, but it isn't bad by any means.  I'll happily order again, especially for iced tea."
Great flavor,"I really like this rice blend. I cook it in my electric steamer using vegetable broth instead of water, and it always comes out great. The 6-pack is a lot of rice though - if you don't eat rice frequently, you may want to store the bags in the freezer."
Our girl is happy with it.,This formula is all we have used for our nine month old baby since she was born.  It mixes well even with the water from our filtered tap.  She has grown well and is healthy overall.
makes great ice tea,We love to brew the tea and add juice or mint over ice.  Very nice alternative to black or green tea.
True color,This purple candy melt is true to the picture.  It's sooo pretty.  I made some cake pops for a baby shower and this purple really stands out.  Also the lilac dust gives it a shine. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
"Horrible, spend a lil more and get green mountain","I was very excited to find a cheaper cider. However, it is most likely worth the expense to get green mountain brand. Unfortunately I did not realize that the product was artifically sweetened. When it came I saw on the box that it was and tried it anyway. Luckily one of my roommates enjoyed it so was not a total lose."
Delicious and Chilled,The Mints arrived with a chill pack to insure they would not melt in the summer heat! The jar is handy for serving and the mints are fresh and tasty. Recommend this product for entertaining and as a gift to send or bring.
Love the energy without the super sweet,"I was turned on to Vitalyte (at the time called Gookinade) by a friend and my husband and I LOVE it. I could never drink the other ""power"" drinks as they were way too sweet for my taste so I always stuck with water. After trying this drink, I am hooked! My husband who always drank Gatorade came to drink only Vitalyte after trying it. We live in the desert and now drink it on a daily basis to stay hydrated. Love the lemonade- the only flavor we buy."
my whole family loves these,I'm so glad that Amazon carries these b/c they are almost always out of stock at our local grocery store. These taste like Nutter Butter cookies but much healthier. We love these!
Delicious,"I have never been a big rice eater, but that has now changed. Most rice tastes like cardboard unless you add butter, spices, etc. This rice has no additives, yet when cooked only in plain water, has a very rich & full flavor."
Y ummie in their tummies,"The Canidae Dog Treats, Lamb and Rice flavor, is the best treats for my dogs.  I have been feeding these treats to my dogs for years, and they are still the best.  They are snap biscuits so I can regulate how much I give them at a time, and guard against weight gain.  I use the Lamb and Rice because one of my dogs has an allegery to chicken and wheat.  I have never had a problem with Canidae Dog Treats, as they are healthy and safe to feed my dogs. I have been feeding the Canidae Dog Treats for well over 20 years and I plan on continuing to do so as long as I can still get the 12 pound box, as I have Big Boys to feed."
"good snack, but not cheap!","Okay, this will teach me twice about checking the weight of something before I buy it!  I love these gummy candies and always stock up on them whenever I hit the Asian grocery stores.  So when I saw them online, I admit to being a bit lazy and thought 'hey, it'll be nice to take advantage of getting them shipped home for free' and wrongly assumed that the price of the bag meant that they must be jumbo-sized or something.  So yeah, a bit surprised when the package arrived and it's the same size bag that I can usually get for a few bucks cheaper in a store.  Also, the bag was past its 'best sold by' date (not that the candies tasted stale).<br /><br />Still, these candies are delicious, a nice sweet/tart gummy treat that's individually wrapped (great if you like to share or put something unique out for people) and has a good fruit flavor.  If you can't get to an Asian grocery store, then maybe the price would be worth it.  For myself, I think I'll be a bit less lazy and just stock up more often."
Nice Fresh Newtons,"If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a ""Newton"" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the ""best by"" date."
FFFFIIIINNNNNAAAAALLLLYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Finally some great coffee, thank goodness Starbucks finally gave in.  More varieties please.  Wish they would come in larger quantaties."
Yummy snacks!,"These are a perfect snack to grab on the way out when you don't have time to eat a meal. One bag is quite filling. I purchased on a subscribe and save and the price was awesome, but shortly after, I received an email that Amazon is discontinuing them so I guess I won't get anymore of them. Shame, they are a great price here- from now on I'll have to check the local warehouse clubs."
delicious,package arrived on time and in good condition. these bars are great for watching carb intake
Chili Lime Flavor - Review,"In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list."
SO good!,"To die for, the best sardines ever. Packed in olive oil with a few green olive slices. Sardines are huge."
Blarhhhh,"Kellogg's has gone off the deep end, and so have all of us! Who buys food, much less meal bars that taste like hay off the internet?<br /><br />Watch the movie ""The Road to Wellville"", and in it you'll see that Kellogg was a huge fan of milk enemas.<br /><br />That and Special K Strawberry Protein Meal Bars with Crystal Meth."
we all liked it!,"I added this sauce packet to stir-fried chicken, then mixed it with rice, peas, tamari, carrots.  Husband & I loved it, so did our kids ages 5,6,& 8 (which surprised me.  Couldn't be easier to use.  My only hesitation is that I don't know what all the ingredients are... I much prefer to make my own sauces from scratch, but this will do if I'm in a pinch."
Great healthy snack,"It is great to be able to get a healthy snack in the mail here in Afghanistan!  Appreciated that the mango has not additives or preservatives, just natural and delicious.  Thanks!"
citric acid,"The product is exactly what I wanted, the price was acceptable and I received it in the time stated. I thought the shipping charge was a little too much."
"Not bad at all, just not my favorite","As a relatively new Keurig user (former Senseo user), I have been trying various flavored coffees along with regular pods.  This coffee was not bad, just not my favorite flavor combination.  I'm not sure why because how can you beat chocolate and raspberry.  This is just a personal preference issue.  The product was received in a timely manner and arrived in good shape.  So far my favorite flavored coffee is Timothy's Sugar Bush maple. This flavor may work well for you.  Enjoy"
Great Option For Diabetic Cats!,"My 14 year-old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure earlier this year; it was devastating. I had to administer insulin shots to him twice a day and twice he had hypo-glycemia due to the enormous challenge of balancing insulin levels. Worse, he was miserable and wary of me.<br /><br />At 16 lbs, he was overweight even for a large frame cat so I promptly began an intensive internet research (agree with the earlier poster who cautions against the foods prescribed by vets and sold in grocery stores) and after narrowing the field of high-protein pet foods, decided to try wet food. I was nervous because I had been guilty of feeding my baby delicious, awful-for-him dry foods (I was clueless) so I had no idea how long the transition to Wellness wet would take.<br /><br />There was no transition: He loved the food immediately and the switch was painless. Best, he lost 4 lbs in about 6 months, his blood sugar has stabilized and he's off insulin, hopefully permanently.<br /><br />Wellness isn't cheap, but when compared with the cost of losing a beloved furry member of the family too soon, the price is well-justified!<br /><br />ps. Maximillian's favorites are the chicken and the turkey. Vary for best results!"
Love the product but cheaper at BRU,"I love these variety packs.  My only complaint is that you can get them cheaper at BRU (I found them for $9.99 for a 12 pack, regular price). That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But as far as the actual baby food goes, I don't feel like I could be buying anything better for my baby.  I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.  Not to mention the price and all the work to make it.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real, whole, organic foods.  No preservatives, nothing extra.  So easy!"
Too expensive,"Love this cereal, but I buy  a 35 oz box at Costco for $7,49 and sometimes am offered it with a $2 /box coupon. Its too high here"
Great taste,Amazing coconut flavor and very easy to make! This was the 5th flavor I've made and all came out better then expected.
"Good flavor, but weak","There's more about Bob Marley on these coffee packets than brewing instructions. There are quotes, inspiration, attitude, very nice rendering of a lion, and the man himself holding his impressive locks.  But machine compatibility? Light/med/dark roast? Recommended cup size.  Ah, no.<br /><br />I found that one pod fit the 2-pod holder of my Senseo. Two Marley pods were too large for the 2-pod holder of the Senseo.  I brewed two separate cups, using two pods this morning, but there was no caffeine jolt in this coffee.  A single pod gives a delicious, but slightly weak cup.  Two pods give a very ""Starbucks-y"" cup of coffee with strong flavor, but without their jolt of caffeine. In fact, I needed a third cup of Marley coffee to accomplish what a perfectly ordinary spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee can do any morning of the week when I am in a hurry (but at a cost of around two dollars).<br /><br />If these folks are serious about coffee, they need to take a look at their competition; more flavor and data, less music.  Unless you're running a caf&eacute;."
Delicious and easy!!,"Very tasty.  Great to use as a base for curries - can throw in meat and more veggies, then put over rice.  Yum!"
mix flower bouquet,WE BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT AND SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL BOUQUET!!!<br />WE WOULD DEFINATELY BUY AGAIN!!!
Exactly what I expected - very happy customer.,"These little bees showed up perfectly packaged two days before their arrival estimate.  They are super cute and made me extremely happy.  I was afraid they'd show up and be rock hard, inedible, and with goofy coloring that was just a little bit off.  But they are exactly as they appear in the photo - the white is where it belongs, the stripes are solid and straight, they are delicate but firm and will be the perfect addition to my little beehive cupcakes.<br />I fully intend on ordering more product from this seller in the future with confidence."
My furkids go nuts for these!,"Great product. I love the natural ingredients and my dogs LOVE them! And the small bite size is great. They are perfect for my Pom who is really allergic to beef, chicken and grains. He can enjoy them without his sensitive stomach getting upset."
Stash Premium Christmas Eve Herbal Tea = :),"This is some seriously refreshing tea and since I received my box, I have been consuming three cups a day.  It is delicious and makes me smile.  I highly recommend it as one of the tastiest herbal teas ever to reach my lips."
Not Long Lasting,"Dogs loved it, but they freed it and ate it in minutes.  Turns out to be a dollar a minute for the dogs' enjoyment.  Might as well have been a milk bone."
Good in small doses,"I decided to try Maca as it was recommended for my reproductive system issues. I recently decided to give up taking medications as they weren't helping with my reproductive system issues or my hypothyroidism. I have seen it in my local Whole Foods store for $20 a bag, so Amazon definitely has a great price if you get free shipping.<br /><br />I first tried 1/2tsp Maca in about 4oz of water. The taste wasn't bad at all. I noticed an energized feeling immediately, almost to the point of being jittery but not quite. I got on my elliptical machine and felt my workout went smoother and I felt better throughout the workout. The energized feeling lasted all day, though at times I found it to be a bit much. Clearly Maca is powerful and you need to start out very slowly with it.<br /><br />I have since been putting a 1/2tsp of Maca into a smoothie each morning that I split with my boyfriend. We use frozen fruit, unsweetened coconut milk beverage, 1tbsp maple syrup, 1/4c chia gel, 1/2tsp matcha powder, 1tsp acai powder, and the 1/2tsp Maca powder. It doesn't taste too great since adding the Maca powder, it has a strong flavor in smoothies unlike in water, but I force down the 4oz smoothie each morning. Since adding it to a smoothie and splitting it, I feel energized without the nearly jittery feeling.<br /><br />I have felt great, I've been sleeping through the night, I have energy during the day... it's fantastic. I'm also taking a few other things to help with my specific medical issues so I am not sure what is helping with what, but I do know the Maca gives me great energy, I can exercise without dreading it, and I no longer require naps or feel like I'm dragging in the middle of the day. That itself is worth it!"
A real substitue,"I have really fallen for flavored coffees and I use this as a sub for white sugar.  I like it so much that I now have it regularly shipped to me.  Try it, you'll like it."
My dog goes NUTS for these!!!,I used to try and smash my dogs pill in some moist food but my dog would somehow pick it out and I would find the pill on the floor.  Now with these I just pop the pill in and my dog jumps up and snatches it out of my hand. I dont think she even chews it!  Makes giving pills much easier and smells a little like bacon....Mmmmmmm...Bacon!
Super fast shipping and Great Value if your addiction to K-Cups is causing your family to starve.,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKAA2"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup, Rainforest Blend, 36-Count</a><br /><br />I tirelessly searched for an alternative to high priced K-Cups. Low and Behold I stumbled upon San Francisco Bay Coffee one cup for Keurig. The coffee is very flavorful the packaging uses less plastic which keeps me in good standing with my highly environmentally conscience girlfriend. I believe I ordered the coffee Sunday morning and I had it by Tuesday afternoon. What else can I say great coffee and quick shipping,what more could you want. Also saved with subscribe and save although that doesn't seem to allow you to change the flavor of your coffee from month to month. Oh well, live and learn."
Full flavor.,Maxwell has always been a great coffee. To put that same flavor in a T-Discs is great. I'm sure I will order more of the Maxwell coffee's.
Illy Expresso Coffee is Great,I began using Illy Expresso Coffee because it was the only expresso that I could find that carried decaffeinated expresso. It is sold in air tight cans that keep the coffee fresh. It has a very good flavor and is finely ground.  A very good product.
My cats love this stuff,"I've been feeding my cats wellness since I weaned the stray kitten and got the shelter kitten, and they seem to like all the flavours plenty but I've been alternating this and the straight chicken stuff for the past few weeks and they've basically stopped eating the chicken stuff, I guess saving space for this stuff instead."
Not as good as it used to be...,"My children and I have eaten Annie's macaroni & cheese for over ten years and loved it. So it was to my dismay when I began to notice in the last year that the flavor was obviously reformulated to be much weaker. The directions were also reconfigured. It used to be 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of milk; now it calls for 1/4 cup of milk, which is why the outcome is so runny and yucky. My children have never eaten Kraft mac & cheese, so we were comparing the difference in taste with the original Annies. I honestly expect that my family will wean themselves of Annies mac & cheese because the flavor is that disappointing and bland."
Delicious!,"Everyone in my family enjoys these delicious Granola bars.  They are crunchy and yummy.  I like mine with coffee.  They are also great for snacks, while hiking or out and about.<br /><br />My kids love them as a quick breakfast before school.  Maybe not the healthiest breakfast, but better than none at all.  There are few things you can keep on hand that everyone will eat, this seems to be one.<br /><br />Quality is good and price is reasonable.  Thumbs up!"
Pretty good stuff,"I'm not a huge fan of this flavor, I prefer sugar free caramel but my husband loves this flavor!!<br /><br />I only buy this brand of flavorings. The taste is always consistent."
"Delicious, no dented/damaged cans","I usually eat Libby's canned pumpkin; pumpkin isn't on the Dirty Dozen list [...] so buying organic wasn't a priority for me. But I eat pumpkin year-round and the stores around me were low on canned pumpkin, so I decided to order it.<br /><br />I hadn't actually tasted this particular product before ordering it from Amazon. I was a bit nervous that it would taste bad and I would be stuck with 12 cans.  Luckily, this canned pumpkin is delicious and I think it tastes better than Libby's. I usually eat it mixed with oatmeal or yogurt or in pumpkin smoothies.  Sometimes, I just eat it with some pumpkin pie spice and sweetener.<br /><br />All the cans arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />I ordered this  item on December 17, 2010."
K-Cup Holder,This holder is great.  If your cabinets are tall enough you can set this underneath your Keurig and create some space on your countertops.  I also got the product in a timely manner.
Always a favorite!,This variety of Celestial Seasonings is my very first choice for a (Keurig) K-Cup tea.  Just spicy enough to be flavorful without being overpowering.  And the orange flavor is very  tasty!
Don't taste good,"Nobody would expect these to taste as good as regular brownies, but these don't even feel like a dessert.  They're dry and chalky and the chocolate taste is weak.  Brownies shouldn't taste like you're taking your fiber medicine."
Delicious for Adkins Dieters!,"I've been low-carb dieting and I like pork rinds so I couldn't wait to try these. They're not really ""spicy"", they're more like mild in my opinion. They are good, they taste just like the pork rinds that you buy at the store, not ""bacon-y"" at all to me. The only downside is that your house will smell like hot pork rinds. It's pretty bad, I don't normally notice things like that but it's pretty smelly and hard to get rid of."
ADDICTIVE,"After years of being addicted to Smart Puffs, as soon as I tried these Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, I was an instant convert.<br /><br />They are light, crispy, and perfectly salty and vinegar-y.<br /><br />I think they taste amazing, however, my husband can't eat these chips because they make his eyes water. I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same, and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried, including the ones that are terribly bad for you."
Good Value & Healthy,"I have been buying FooJoy Green Tea for years.  It is the only liquid I consume.  Always have a jug in the fridge.  In the summer I make sun tea with it.  In the winter, I boil a pot of water and then seep many bag.  Not as good as sun boiled, but it works.  Very tasty.  Very good antioxidant.  I've been healthy all these years, too.  Also great value."
Hemp Seeds For My Raw Food Diet,"The hempseeds are great! I wasn't able to buy them locally and found that buying them through Amazon not only was affordable, but excellent quality! I will continue to purchase many of the foods I need for my Raw Food diet at Amazon and it's partners."
Where is it?,"This is the best coffee! It doesn't have the sharp smell that most coffees have and there's no bite, and no sour stomach.  I contacted Folgers and they say it is still available but I can't find it anywhere. Their partner website Smuckers doesn't sell it either. I would pay double the price for this coffee, if someone would start carrying it again."
Candy sticks were broken,Purchased the 80 count tutti frutti candy sticks for my wedding buffet..at least 60 were broken. Not happy and will have to purchase from somewhere else. Wasted my money & just going to throw these away..
Great gluten-free snack,"I started picking up these bars at the health food store after I had to give up granola bars.  The cherry pie bars taste amazingly like the real filling, except without all the unnecessary sugar.  The bars are sweet enough on their own and the nuts add a delightful crunch.  The other flavors are delicious as well.  The price of the individual bars can fluctuate by more than sixty cents depending on the vendor and Amazon sells them for less as a large package than the individuals would cost at the cheapest store.  The organic ingredients and lack of additives ensure that the bars are gluten-free, but are still tasty."
Product Has Changed,"Been purchasing this product for years. I have enjoyed it's dark color and molasses like taste. I opened a new shipment this morning and immediately noticed that the color of the produce has changed. Instead of the usual dark amber color, the sugar is almost blond. Upon tasting it I found that along with the loss of color it has also lost much of it's unique taste. It's almost like using white sugar. I think this will be the LAST order from this supplier for me."
Kids Love!  Better Ingredients!,"My girls love these so much that I have a hard time getting them to eat much else at breakfast time.  I feel better about getting this brand because the ingredients are much better for them then the competing non-organic brands.  So if they are going to eat them, this is the one to buy."
"VERY GOOD,EXELENTE","ES UN HIDRATANTE DE MUY ALTA CALIDAD,ES EXELENTE PARA LARGAS JORNADAS,DE EJERCICIO,TE RECUPERA MUY RAPIDO,EVITA EL AGOTAMIENTO,Y TE DA ENERGIAS EXTRAS,YO PERSONALMENTE CORRO EN BICICLETA 100 KILOMETROS POR DIA,POR 3 DIAS A LA SEMANA,Y HA HECHO MARAVILLAS CONMIGO<br />LO RECOMIENDO,ES EXELENTE"
Dove Understands Men,"My husband's first reaction after using this body wash was, ""It's unexpectedly gritty.""  He said the smell was just okay, though I loved how it smelled on his skin.  Very manly and enticing.  Then he went on a trip and I tried it myself (I didn't want to smell like a man while he was home; this stuff has a *very* distinctly masculine scent) so I'd have firsthand knowledge of its performance.<br /><br />After the getting past the somewhat poorly designed cap (hard to open), the grittiness was the first thing *I* noticed, too.  I've often used various exfoliating scrubs, so the experience is not unknown to me, but I somehow felt that this stuff would not actually do anything but uselessly scratch the skin.  I used it on my face, which I found uncomfortable, and despite taking great care, I felt like I got some grit in my eyes.  And the smell was absolutely overpowering.<br /><br />I usually apply body lotion after showering, but I didn't this time so I could evaluate the product's moisturizing ability.  My skin felt kind of tight and irritated, especially my face, but this passed after a while (except for on my hands and feet, which seemed to be much more dried out than they are after showering with my regular soap, currently <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R961M0"">Dove Cool Moisture Beauty Bar</a>).  In places (such as my shoulders), I noticed that the body wash had left a waxy residue.<br /><br />Then my husband came home and tried it again.  This time he said he *likes* the grit, and he reported that it did not cause him any irritation anywhere (even on sensitive parts).  And he said he really likes that it easily washes off very well (a perception I didn't share).  He still likes the scent, but he (unbelievably!) said he prefers something with a stronger scent (he uses <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019ZB62Q"">Zest Body Wash Shower Gel, Aqua Pure</a>) to get him going in the morning.  He likes this enough to continue using it, but when he runs out, he said he'll go back to his regular body wash.<br /><br />Overall, I would personally give Dove Men + Care (awkward name, isn't it?) three stars, with the highlight being the scent.  But since I'm not the target market here, I'll give it what my husband voted, four stars."
Cola Syrup,"I thought this syrup was gonna taste like cola, the one used to do frozen cokes, ice-cones, etc. However, it wasn't like that. This cola is for something else; perhaps is good for mixing with alcoholic beverages, or coffee, but definitely NOT for ice-cones. The taste is very strong, so I do not recommend this for kids. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad syrup, BUT -- It is a syrup for adults to mix with ""adult"" drinks, not kids. I'm just giving it 3 stars because it doesn't specify anywhere that this product shouldn't be used to make frozen colas nor to add on icy-cones."
Happy Baby food is super delicious and nutritious!,"I know I can make the same thing at home in my blender. However, my kids won't eat it because it's not in a cool squeeze container like the Happy Baby blends. They are the best! Both my children love them and I am happy to let them grab them off the shelf at anytime. The nutritional value is hard to beat. The quality is excellent."
Greaaaaaaaaaaaaaat,"My sister got some of these for me and now I'm hooked , not to many stores carry them around my area and I buy them by the case :) I snack on them daily."
Good dog!,"We first found Lean Treats at the vet's clinic. Our dogs won't go for just anything, but they love what they love. And they love these little treats!"
Yummy,"I like this chili because it's a little different.  It makes a hotdog taste good.  I learned from a neighbor you could have it for a party.  Have a chili party and have all the fixins for a 2,3,4, or 5 way chili treat."
What is this?  Not quantified.,The price is 4X that of the 4-pak (16 pouch).  the shipping weight suggests<br />maybe 40 pouches ?? or equivalent to 5 of the 4-paks.
"Great tea- you can find a much better price, though","I love the regular Sleepytime tea, so I was excited to try this.  It was wonderful- the jasmine adds a really nice flavor. I love that I get my green tea in easily this way- and it is not bitter in the least.  (I'll note the Sleepytime vanilla was too sweet and mild for me.) But, I found it at almost 1/3 of the price doing a google search."
Effective,"It's very effective. I don't use it for losing weight, but I drink it when I need to regulate my bowel movmnt. :)"
"Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix, Fat Free","The box of cocoa came surprisingly fast. That variety of cocoa is not available in our city, so grateful to get it by mail. Most pleased."
"Actually, my dogs love it!","Great, natural product for the dogs.  They think they are eating candy, but really are eating a wholesome snack food."
Very Good!,"I've had the other Nana's No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they aren't that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good. They are more moist, have a good flavor and a little crunch. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. I will be buying these again."
Hurry up and wait,Product is very slow to ship! Order before the 24th of December and still has not shipped and its going on the 30th
Legal Crack,"What negative thing could I possibly say about these?<br />Oh yes.. the price.<br /><br />It costs over a dollar a bar to get a fix of this legal crack.<br />They are that delicious (at least this flavor, the cherry dark chocolate and the peanut dark chocolate.. I was not to fond of the super nutty one - but to each their own)<br />These in particular have an addictive quality which hurts my bank account.<br />you shouldn't be eating more than one of them in a day though, so it's honestly not that bad of a deal.<br />They just taste so darn good."
Love Orgain,"Orgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge is my favorite, but there is also a Mocha flavor that is also really good.  The Mocha is not as thick as the Creamy Chocolate Fudge. I don't like the vanilla.  The ingredients don't contain anything with chemical names like a lot of pre-packaged foods, and I like that it was created by a doctor who had cancer and wanted to create a healthy food."
My cats beg for this,My cats love this because it has a lot of sauce. They like the regular Whiskas tender bites wet food also but end up licking off the sauce and leaving most of the food behind. This is their new favorite food.
Big Train Spiced Chai,"This is the best Chai tea ever! It is amazing. I believe it is the cure to anything. Sore throat, stomach ache, heartache, bad day, you name it... Big Train Spiced Chai will fix it. It is so yummy, I just love it!"
For small dogs?,I have a question. Are these collars with the sensors going to be too big abd bulky for my 6lb dogs ? I want to order but am worried the collars will be uncomfortable.
"Tasty, portable snack - a little tart","I think I like these more than my son, who I purchsed them for as an easy and healthy snack.  I don't think there's much difference between the flavors, and the sour apple is fairly tart.  But overall, I think they're good, and they're really a great way to bring a serving of fruit with you anywhere."
"A refreshing twist on water, conveniently carried","I've been drinking a lot more water these days than soda, which does save money and has to be healthier for you, but water does get boring. I was given the chance to try the MiO Peach Tea flavor, and I found I really like it. The first time I squirted it, I missed my glass, so be sure you aim it straight down where you want it to go!<br /><br />Like so many other food products these days, MiO does depend on chemical sweeteners (for 0g of everything), so I don't think I would be using a lot of it. But just a little squirt perks up cold water really well. A good thing, too, is the fact that you can cut down on your use of plastic by using MiO for your flavoring. Just ask for water at a restaurant or fill your bottle from the water fountain, squeeze in a little, and voila! The MiO bottle is about the size of a laptop mouse, so it will easily tuck into a bag or pocket."
Instinct,"My cat does not like this food sorry, plus when received it was more dust in the bag then nibblets. very disppointed"
My favorite K-Cup flavor,"Some of the other K-Cup varieties are too weak for a 12oz brew, but I don't have that problem with Green Mountain Dark Magic.  If you like a bold cup of coffee, give these a try.  If you don't want to commit to a whole 24 pack, find a local supermarket that has a Green Mountain grinding machine, and buy a small amount of fresh ground Dark Magic coffee to try out the flavor."
very good,"i only let my kids drink 100% juice, my kids really do not like juice with bananas in it but they really love this one. i will buy it again"
Great crackers,My 3 year old son loves these crackers. He's been gluten free for 8 months now and this is the best cheese cracker we've found.
A great find,"Dieting since mid-May using whole grains in pastas, rice, etc, and this orzo in whole wheat is just not able to be found anywhere but here--so happy to find it. (Now if I could also find whole grain orecchiette too, hint). With 9 grams of fiber per 2oz serving, this orzo delivers high fiber, just what I wanted.  Use it in rice dishes like pilafs and stuffed peppers, add to soups, or just serve as a side dish on its own w/butter and sage, etc..no need to go back to white orzo anymore."
very good tea,If you follow correct method of preparing (let this tea in boiling water for 10-15 minutes) this will taste great.<br /><br />Better place to buy this is go to nearest Indian store they generally sell 1 lb in USA for around 2.99$ only. Not sure why it is overpriced online.
The best!,"I started drinking this tea after a Doctor of alternative medicine recommended it to cure a Yeast Infection. It worked! I did not had to do to a GYN to cure my yeast infection. Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you."
Yummy classic,"Ive used this corn muffin mix for years and have always loved the results. My whole family enjoys this cornbread and ask to have it with breakfast, lunch, dinner and even as a snack."
Great price and luv auto ship!,Our three dogs love these and in a previous review the price is very good.  I have had a difficult time finding these large bags since our PetSmart in Atlanta stopped carrying them and the cost of a small bag is ridiculous. The added plus is that my order is on auto ship so no need to worry anymore when we are about to run out since we know an order is always on the way.  Thanks for this service Amazon!
Yuk!,"This coffee is bitter, has a nasty bite! It doesn't brew up very strong, either (I use a coffee press). I'm used to Sumatra roasted dark. This is medium roasted. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because of the organic/ fair trade/ shade grown and also...well, at least the beans didn't taste burned."
My Pomeranians LOVE these!,Fabulous product line!  No odors!  No stains!  I have two male 8 pound Pomeranians and they love these as a treat at night when my husband and I are watching a movie.  It is great to not worry about them staining the bedding or furniture.
"Good, clean oil!","I was so excited to get such high-quality oil in a pack of three! I can use it for oil pulling, cooking, massage, and as a carrier oil for washing my face. Easy to pour, no-nonsense packaging. I'm satisfied!"
Dissinigrates too fast,"I have to admit, I was pretty much expecting this to taste like dreck. But I was pleasantly surprised. Krave doesn't taste too sugary. It's basically a chocolate flavored graham cracker. But don't expect a super strong chocolate flavor. Despite the image on the box, if you break open one of the pieces, you'll see that there is almost no chocolate inside.<br /><br />My gripe against the cereal is that it becomes soggy and disintegrates very quickly when combined with milk. I personally prefer my cereal to be crunchy, which Krave isn't after you add the milk."
are these K Cups,Please specify if these are K-cups. Very confusing. Don't know if they would work with my Keurig Coffee Maker.
6-Jar Variety Pack Trappist Monks Preserves,"DELICIOUS!!!  A wonderful set of flavors and a nice way to support the church.  Just wish this product was a little cheaper because it comes from workers in a religious organization that is not payrolled.  The only things that would make me choose different Cmas gifts this year would be the shipping fees.  If Trappist issues gift cards, that might be the way to shop until our economy stabilizes."
Great Slim Jims,"I received my order quickly and without any damage. Product was very good and well within the expiration date. I recommend, so long as you like the original Slim Jim."
Best coffee ever,"My favorite blend of my favorite coffee.  Used to have to smuggle a few pounds of the stuff back in my suitcase everytime I went out to the midwest! Now I can get in k-cups.  Yay! Good price on amazon, but super saver shipping takes forever! Fedexing it to the post office makes no sense.  just fedex it to me and shave 2 days off the wait already!"
I love PB2!,"I can't get enough PB2.  I put it in my smoothies almost every morning--I use bananas, almond milk, ice, kale, and PB2 and it creates an awesome banana-peanut butter shake.  I also love to spread it on rice crackers with jelly for a low-fat snack."
treats are too hard,"I need some soft treats for reinforcement... this is definitely NOT it...<br />it is hard like rock candy, and my dogs turn their nose up at this product... will not eat it..."
Good Snack for Studying,"I recently went back to school and am up late studying.  I want to avoid eating late though also need some energy and protein to stay focused.  I've tried and like all of the crunch ma-me flavors and the veggie medley is a good way to ""mix it up""."
"Great taste, fast shipping!","Has a great taste, and just the right amount without devouring a huge bag! Received them very quickly. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a portion-controlled lean protein snack."
Picky terrier,"This might be one of the most liked dog treats, but my dog hated it.<br />She licked it, put it in her mouth, and spat it right out.<br />It smells really bad too. I had it in an airtight ziplock bag, but the smell was so strong, my whole car smelled like it the rest of the day.<br />I guess I'll donate it to the shelter or something..."
Sweet & Spicy,"When I tried these at a grocery trade store, I was blown away.  They are delicious!  I think they are sweeter than they are spicy, but I am *very* tolerant of spicy foods.  The flavor is so rich and bold that they actually last a while in the cupboard; I don't eat the whole can at once."
Very Good Coffee,"This is a very good coffee, I saw they were using it in local casinos, at our bingo halls etc, and so I searched and found it here on Amazon.  I drink it at the bingo halls with a little creamer and sweetner and it is very good, at home I use a flavored creamer, my husband drinks it black and he like it too.  The additon of Creamer doesnt kill the flavor of the coffee"
My new favorite cereal!,"Just the right combination of cereal, clusters, and dried peaches that come to life with milk.  My whole family really likes it.  Too expensive to have all the time though, and not available locally."
Better tasting than any of the K-Cups to date!,"This is really a great cup of coffee. It has a deep complex taste and is not at all bitter. It is a good balanced strong tasting brew if made at the 8oz recommended level. While not a K-cup per se, it is just as well thought out with it's open mesh design. It is basically the inside of the K-Cup without the plastic bottom.  The person that gave it 2 stars because he/she says the 1st cup may be good but the rest will go stale, is just plain stupid. I guess he/she has never heard of a plastic bag or container. Once you open the package just stick them in an airtight container or plastic bag...oooh that's difficult! I wonder when he wrote that review if he had something more than just coffee in his cup??"
Great Chips!,"I love the taste of these chips! If you are looking for a healthy snacking alternative, this one definitely fits the bill!"
Spicy yumminess but super high in sodium...,"I love the taste and texture and it's just the right amount of hot spicy.  Yum!  Great flavor!  My problems with it are the extremely high sodium and lack of much tofu.  There are NOT chunks like the photo, the few there are dissolve into tiny pieces that are weirdly crunchy.  Still yummy and a filling snack, just not that nutritious.  It's not vegetarian so don't let the tofu content fool you... :)"
Great snack!,This was my daughters first solid food at 5 months and she still at 13 months loves them! I love having a healthy snack that is easy to take along and not very messy. They are great to take to the grocery store to keep her occupied while I am shopping.
"Whole grains, superfoods and it tastes great!","I recently fell in love with Kind Fruit and Nut bars, so when I discovered that Kind also made granola, I couldn't wait to check it out.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of eating healthy and Kind has become a go-to brand for me as it's all natural and offers everything from whole grains to omega-3's to fiber and more. The Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds combine antioxidant rich cinnamon, flax seeds and whole grains amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat. These clusters are high in fiber, contain 720mg of omega-3 fatty acids and 16g of whole grains per serving and one third cup serving is only 130 calories!<br /><br />Anyone who loves cinnamon will love these. They're great for eating out of the bag, having with milk, or mixing with yogurt and they also offer just the right crunch. I can't wait to try the different flavors that Kind has to offer."
Bacon salt sampler,"I have only had time to try one of these so far, and wasn't overly impressed with the taste. I consider myself a bacon expert, as I could sit down and eat good bacon until I explode, but thought the taste just wasn't what I had hoped for from this product."
Mangolicious!!!,"We decided to purchase direct from the company and save some money. In comparison pricing to other retailers, this was a good deal. Great throat lozenges and great for an alternative to bland mints and gum. Enjoy the mango/ginger flavour."
Not as good as their pure virgin olive oil.,"Does not store as well as their virgin olive oil.  I have and use both and this product develops an aftertaste rather quickly when stored.  Compared to the extra virgin olive oil they sell this product is not as tasty.  Would recommend you spend the extra bucks and get the pure stuff.  Problem with cans being bent up, but seller worked to correct that so there's no complaint other than use of poor shipper."
Very poor quality; little real meat;,"There is very little meat in this food and there are toxic chemicals.<br /><br />Various Meat By Products--lower quality than whole meat or meals and harder to digest than actual meat.<br /><br />Caramel coloring is only necessary when there is not enough meat.  Caramel color may be carcinogenic.<br /><br />""Liquid Top Sirloin flavor""  ""Grilled chicken flavor""--  Flavoring is only necessary when the product has insufficient meat.  Top Sirloin flavoring is made from manure of cattle.<br /><br />Carageenan causes cancer, including breast cancer.  Read an interview with Joanne Tobacman, MD, professor of internal medicine, University of Iowa at [...]<br /><br />There are no vegetables in this food.<br /><br />Cesar has repeatedly stated that his entire goal in coming to the United States was to go to Hollywood and be famous.  I think that that focus on fame (and money) is apparent in his approach to dog food:  Give crummy food nice packaging and an appealing name.<br /><br />That one's dog will eat it is no advertisement.  First, the only thing one really has to do to sell dog food is make it so the dogs will eat it.  That the dog will eat it is no measure of the quality or benefit of the food.  Dogs eat anything--including manure, which is part of this food as the meat flavoring."
A Delicious Treat Hot Or Cold,I really used to enjoy drinking this premixed delight whenever I needed a lift. It is very potent and sweet. Just like thai tea is supposed to be.
Tasty and works!,"First off, my cat HATES regular Greenies (the big crunchy ones) and won't even try to lick them. Any flavor. But my big fluffy Himalayan was hacking up stinky furballs in unreachable places, so when I saw these at the pet store I bought them on a whim.<br /><br />She loves them! I don't think she even chews the things, she inhales them so fast. Tuna treats are ok but chicken were more popular around here. She likes these better than the Temptations treats she had before, and I am convinced that these are somewhat healthier.<br /><br />The pouch recommends 12 treats a day, all at once, or even more for my big-boned cat. I usually do more like 5-6, because that many treats seems excessive (she would love it though). Either way, she hasn't had any hairballs since. I am not positive about the causal relationship, but I suspect these did the trick. They're great!"
Taste better than Chow Mein,"Myojo make high quality instant noodle, this is no exception. This should fill you up since it has like 600 calories, it comes with lots of sauce, the noodle is high quality. You get what you paid for in instant noodles."
Dont be fooled by the photo,"There is no correlation between the cover of the apple pies on the ad and what you get.  They dont look at all alike.  I would certainly not buy these again.  Maybe l l/2 spoonful of apple inside...and not good tasting either.  Sorry, I hate to do this but the truth is the truth. Dont be fooled.  Not a good product."
donut house collection,"this coffee taste great and taste just like  cinnamon rool,chocolate donut,donuthouse coffee the best ive tasted so far really good coffee."
Sprinkles,These sprinkles do not taste good at all. Especially if you eat what you decorate right after you decorate it. Not that impressed
Great,"I've been using this for multiple purposes - for hair and skin care, and for cooking. Makes my hair really soft and soaks in nicely, and even though I have never had particularly rough skin, I am noticing a difference with softness. For cooking, I don't know exactly how well it's working - it's supposed to boost metabolism and promote energy, but I've only been taking it for a week so I haven't really noticed. But one thing's for sure, it's a lot healthier than cooking with butter..."
Pasty,"I really thought that I would like this flour.  But everything I make with it seems a little starchy.  Has a kind of wallpaper paste texture, gummy.  I won't be buying this again."
Pups love them!,BOth our Golden Doodles  really love these treats.  I love them because they are good for them. I definitely will re-order.
Excellent little chocolate rum cake.,"Personally, like this one better than the Key Lime cake, although both are great. No refrigeration required, making this an ideal little Goody to keep in your cupboard for those unexpected guests.  Nice to have on hand for those special ooccasions when a little treat is desired.  Rich, wonderful taste, great cake texture, and awesome fragrance. Enjoy!"
Yuck!,My son really wanted these as he loves the other flavors. But They are DISGUSTING!!! Too much lime :(  So bummed I bought a case and can't return the unopened 23 we didn't touch and do not plan on touching.
I wasn't impressed...,"Okay, first of all, this says for dogs AND cats, and I sampled it because it actually only said ""cat treats.""  Ummm, I have three cats, and none of them would touch this stuff.  First of all, they're HUGE, round discs.  You have to break it up into about 30 pieces (which is soft and gross and makes your hands stink) and even then, none of my cats were at all enthused with the results.  They sniffed, turned their nose up, and walked away.<br /><br />The dog however, was happy to clean up behind them.  She loved these treats, and they're definitely more large-dog size.  Each treat is a couple inches in diameter, almost an inch thick, I have NO IDEA why they would label these as cat treats.<br /><br />They're a little expensive for what they are, and there aren't that many in the package.  However the ingredients are good, and my dog loved them.  I'm just pretty disappointed these weren't cat treats since that's what I had originally wanted.<br /><br />Good for dogs, find something else if you have a cat!"
It works!,"I have used this product for quite some time on and off.  It is easy to use, drink a cup before bed and<br />excellent results in the morning.  It is very beneficial for those times when life gets you out of sync."
Where is the MINT,"This product stinks, no mint but has lemon juice in it. That's not mint. Had better Green Tea with organic mint it. Will cancel this subscription."
Yum!,My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself!
I am picky about my coffee but this is good stuff,"This was the first time that I had tried any Marley Coffee but I really like it. It is certainly a high quality coffee and has an excellent flavor. I am a little picky about my coffee and usually stick to Starbucks Sumatra or Caff&eacute; Verona because I enjoy bolder and more flavorful coffee. Marley Coffee One Love blend is every bit as good as my favorite coffee and I really enjoy it. There are 15 single serve pods in this package and each pod is packed with plenty of coffee so it makes a great tasting cup of coffee. The pods and individually wrapped in foil so they stay very fresh and it makes them easy to store and carry with you.<br /><br />These pods are for a pod brewer not to be mistaken for a Keurig, Tassimo, CBTL or any other type of single serve coffee maker. I have noticed that some people are saying that these pods make week coffee and that just shouldn't be the case at all. They might be using them incorrectly or in the wrong type of machine if that is the case. The pods also tell you which side is up so maybe if you brew it backwards then it might make a difference but I honestly haven't tried it that way."
Ultra weak tea,"Please don't order this tea.  I love Earl Grey tea but this brand tastes awful.  I tried every size cup starting with the largest which tasted very weak.  When I got to the smallest, it tasted soapy.  I wish I had just ordered my regular brand because I wasted my money on this."
absolutely disgusting,"i grew up eating this soup. the picture on the can is what this soup USED to look like. this is utter fraud. there is almost no snapper of any kind. it is on the very bottom of the ingredient list next to SALT.<br />if you were looking for a nice bowl of vegetarian gravy, this is for you."
Ritz crackers bought from Amazon.com,"I like these a lot.  They are enough protein to pick me up in the afternoon.  However, some of the crackers didn't have any peanut butter in them."
Best Bars on the Planet,"We first discovered these bars at HiHealth, but found them a bit cheaper on Amazon. The JayBar tastes fantastic. A lot of bars give you the runs because of the chemicals or whatever, the JayBar does not do that. They taste so darn good. We have only had the Fudge Brownie.<br /><br />Another thing cool, for those that are trying to satisfy their chocolate or candy bar cravings, these do the trick. They also make for quite the filling snack.<br /><br />My husband is a weight lifter, he eats these around mid-day.<br /><br />REMEMBER... they are truley natural, no garbage fillers!!!"
Ok food......not for my dog.,Did research on this food and heard it was a great foodd. My GSD puppy started get diarrhea that turned into bloody stool. Don't think there is anything wrong with this food just that it is not suited for my dog. Off to try another brand and see how that works. And yes I did transition foods over slowly.
Fabulous bread mixes - great service!,"This made the most wonderful bread in my machine!! YUM! Company offers unique bread mixes. Great service - received quickly and in excellent condition. Will buy from again. In fact, just placed another order!"
Delish!,"These cookies are AMAZING and the texture is excellent considering that they're totally vegan. I got turned on to these cookies before I became veg and IMO the pumpkin and lemon cookies are the best. Not a fan of the ""chocolate chip"", unfortunately, but I had no problem, texture-wise, with the lemon and pumpkin flavors at all."
great crackers,"This is  a real great cracker, they are crisp and more like one you would make at home.  A little on the expensive side but all gluten free items are,  I only buy these as a special treat."
Good but a little darker than I like.,I got it because I was looking for a whole bean coffee that was a lighter roast. Some of the reviews mentioned that it wasn't a dark roast. Maybe its not but to my admittedly non expert tastes there was still too much of the dark roast bitterness.
taste awesome!,these taste amazing. might make the poops burn a little :o but they taste amazing. the salt and vinegar ones are the best and very addicting.
Love It!!!!!,"I love instant oatmeal, maple brown sugar is my favorite.  I've tried different brands but Quaker is best.  Weight control has protein in it, I guess some don't know or like the taste of it, however I love it and it holds you longer between meals.  I just wish it didn't cost so much."
Hooked on Sonic!,"I used to be a Diet Coke fanatic. 4-5 a day. At least. I tried the Bliss version first and loved how light and crisp it was. I got my husband to try the Sonic with me and he is hooked now too! I know they're a more expensive choice than other beverages, but I love the taste, the energy I get from it and quite frankly, the appetite supressant effect. For some reason, for me, if I have 2 of these a day I cut way down on the junk I eat and no longer go to fast food places or crave that. Not saying everyone will have the same experience, but for me, this has been a huge boost to trying to give up some bad foods and drinks. I use the Sleep at night and the melatonin works like a charm! Haven't found any variety I don't like but I LOVE Sonic!<br /><br />One note - I wish the delivery settings could be increased to weekly. In my house a case does not last a full week let alone a month!"
"Great Tea, Poorly packaged!!! Arrives with Broken glass","I had this tea at a nearby whole foods and I really liked the flavor.  It does come in the clunky glass bottle, but it kind of added to the charm.  I liked it so much that I went online to find it.  I ordered a case and it arrived soaked in tea and broken glass.  Not recommended!  Will stick to whole foods."
Back to nature classic cream cookies,These cookies are the bomb...you cant go wrong buying these ...they taste great and are healthier for you than the other type ..this brand of cookies are all i buy ..all the flavors taste great ....i have alot of children come to my house and they all love them ...even the picky eaters ...you cant beat these cookies and i appreciate the fact they are healthier for you ...i love a company that cares about what their customers eat..and who says healthy doesnt taste great !
Stopped my eye twitching...,"My left eye had been twitching on and off throughout the day for the last 1-2months.  after the 2nd day of natural calm it began to lessen and now after  a few weeks nothing.  coincidence, i don't think so and i'm a healthcare provider."
Best tasting/effective,"After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."
Delicious,"I've always been a fan of Eight O'Clock, and will search for it while shopping at grocery stores. Having the ability to ship to my overseas address is a delight. The darker roasts are personal favorites, and I've never been disapointed in the coffee when it arrives at my door."
"Not good for low carb, okay tasting",I've been on a low carb diet and bought these.  I wouldn't recommend them.  They aren't bad tasting especially if your craving chocolate/peanut butter.  I get the gitters and feel awful after I eat one.  I have tried Atkin's products which also have the sugar alcohol and 3 net carbs.  I never get the gitters and it curbs my hunger.  In my opinion the Atkins taste 100 times better then the think thin bars.<br /><br />The Think Thin bars have 10 extra carbs then an Atkins bar.  They claim to be only 3 net carbs online but I think this is a lie.
see'candies sugar free dark chocolate,"I am diabetic and to be able to have a piece of chocolate once in a while is great.I have celiac also, so I eat very healthy and am a nutrtion nut.  But every once in awile I feel like having chocolate and belivie me these are as good as you can get.  My family loves them and they are gone in no time which is good for me because of my careful healthy  diet.  If you get them, you will not be dissapointed.  Go ahead, give them a try and give yourself a treat. I got them from Amazon which gives fast service."
Didn't buy on Amazon but,"Since getting my Keurig machine I have been experimenting with variety of K-cups.  I didn't get this on amazon but caught it on sale at the local market.  It's a good basic cup of coffee.  While trying to figure out flavor preferences (with things like caramel, blueberry, etc.) it's nice to have a basic that you can rely on.  Some of the flavors aren't strong enough and some of the other brands or roasts are way too strong.  Nantucket blend is a happy medium."
mint tea,"I enjoyed the tea.  If I were ill with a cold or the flu I might purchase this tea for the mint effects.  The soothing effects on my sinuses, throat and chest were enjoyable.  If I had an upset stomach this tea would make me feel better.  Having said all that, the actual taste of the tea is flat and overpowered by the mint flavor.  I tasted the bag the tea is in as much as the tea itself."
"the kitties say ""more, please!""","We have six cats ranging in age from a year old to seventeen years old (with diabetes and hyperthyroid). The eldest guy gets mostly canned food (Wellness and Eagle Pack, plus prescription food mixed in) because he's missing teeth and tends to be a picky eater. Everyone loves this food.<br /><br />I love it too because it looks like real food and smells like real food. The fish isn't stinky at all (I got some wellness shrimp & sardine that about ran me out of the house once, LOL!). There's plenty of liquid to help the old guy eat it, and even my mom's cat who is finicky loves it too.<br /><br />I like the fact that I'm feeding high quality, human grade food to my cats. This is good stuff, and I'm going to look for it locally. Thanks!"
Wonderful Breakfast Bar!!,"These bars are great - and I am not even particularly fond of cranberries. They are not overly sweet (I can't quite stomach chocolate early in the morning), but provide a good, solid start to the day. They are my favorite breakfast bar right now, and for those who do like cranberries, you will love these."
"Quality vanilla, better price from the warehouse","I've tried more expensive vanillas, and I've found this brand to be just as good as any others I've tried.  I bought once from Amazon, then realized my local Costco sells this for half the price, around $6 rather than the $12 I paid here."
Son's 2nd Favorite Dish,I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my son's 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.
Love the BBQ flavor,"I dislike most ""diet"" snacks -- like baked  potato chips. But the barbecue pop chips taste as good or better than most non-diet snacks. I did not care for the vinegar and salt & pepper varieties -- and haven't tried the others yet -- but the BBQ chips are great. I make sure I always have these in the house."
"Quick shipping to US, a bit stale","I ordered these after hearing so much about them on the internet. They're delicious, but the arrived slightly stale (understandable; they had to be shipped across the pond).<br /><br />If you have any inclination to buy these, do it!"
good for nursing,"took over 2 weeks and gradually increasing intake to 4 pills 3x a day, but definitely helped my supply!"
Another good Cheerios variety,"While Honey Nut Cheerios are my favorite, this multigrain variety is also very tasty. These are not the healthiest of the multigrain cereals out there, but they're not terrible for you either. They are a very nice middle ground between a sugary ""kids"" cereal and a true whole grain cereal. They have a light, sweet glaze, and the delicious crunch typical of Cheerios. Also like all Cheerios they're beloved by toddlers and make as good a snack as they do a breakfast meal. They go really well with half a banana sliced over the top."
I agree with 'Disappointing and stale' reviewer....,"Great price on a great brand but this order I got was stale, flat and just not 8 oclock quality..."
Great Product!,"I received this as a gift and it was awesome! ""Gourmet gift basket"" indeed! It looks identical to the picture and tasted delicious! I definitely recommend this as a unique, delicious gift for a co-worker or friend!"
Organic Flatbread from Dr. Cracker review,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KLT05C"">Doctor Kracker Organic and Artisan-Baked Flatbread, Pumpkin Seed Cheddar, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I have eaten this product at Jason's Deli and loved it.  However, when I found it online, the price was quite high, but since we liked it so much, I ordered it anyway.  It was delivered quickly, just a matter of a couple days, because it is made not 10 miles from our office.  BUT IT TASTED STALE.  That was a real disappointment and I will not order any more.  It's much too expensive to be stale in less than 3 days of my order.  Both my husband and I had it again at Jason's Deli yesterday and it tasted fresh and wonderful.  Our experience was not a happy one.  I tried to find a retailer who sells it in the area, since it is made right here, but could not find one, so I guess we will just have to find something else."
Excellent Coffee,"Wonderful, rich flavor. Low acid, no after taste.  We have really enjoyed this coffee and will be purchasing it again soon. We are so glad to be able to get certified organic coffee for a decent price."
Great service,Not only is the popcorn terrific and as advertised (hull less) but the order arrived early thanks to their fast and efficient service. Yep! We will do much business with them over the coming years.
You won't believe what you'll catch!,"I have been using this product for many years.  It is a great non-poisonous method of controlling the insect population in and around your house.<br /><br />I could not believe all that I caught.  Spiders, roaches, earwigs, a poor lizard, more spiders, more bugs...  Just put them in corners along the baseboard and check them periodically.  Mine filled up in no time with nasty critters.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this item if you are looking to catch bugs."
Stale,"The product arrived on time but was stale.  I have purchased this product from Kashi at other times and it just did not meet the standard.  It is not close to the expiration date, but I almost lost a tooth trying to eat it.  Good product, but it is not a good idea to purchase it through Amazon."
POP it's a chip!,"I'ma fairly healthy eater, but I LOVE chips.  Potato chips, tortilla chips, I like them all.  Popchips offer a chip like substance,with the promise of low fat.<br /><br />They crunch like chips but don't quite have a chip like texture; it's closer to a rice cake.  The seasoning is decent as well.  They have a surprising amount of a great sweet potato flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients are okay as far as healthiness.  I like that rice flour is the first ingredient rather than potatoes or corn.  You still get oil, although less than normal chips.  There's more salt and sugar than I would like.<br /><br />In the end I found myself munching through the case of 24 fairly quickly.  Popchips taste good and aren't as bad for you.  Check them out!"
Good stuff - good value,"Our ""senior"" dog quit limping around(arthritis) after a week or so of eating this stuff! Plus the bits are a good size, like marbles, not too big like some foods we've bought in the past."
Fantastic,This was an excellent purchase. The product itself was a perfect blend making it smooth and easy to drink. The service of the seller was great and very fast. I would recommend this seller without hesitation.
"Great Drink!  But, please, change the name!","The store around the corner started carrying this drink about six months ago.  Great drink! Refreshing and a bit different.  I love the fact that there are only 35 Calories to the entire bottle.  In terms of helping with my libido...got no idea about that...haven't timed it for that.  But, frankly, I think the name is awful!  I get embarassed being seen with the drink (I work with mostly women).  So, Neuro...lets change the name and keep the taste/benefits!  Bottom Line, great drink!"
Too bad you can't give it 0 stars!!!,"Only good use for these would be: In case of poisoning, use to induce vomiting!"
I Opened The Bag & It Smelled Like A Dirty Ashtray,"You know when you open a bag of coffee how you stick your nose in there and I knew I was in trouble when it just smelled bad - a little bit like a dirty ashtray.  Despite the smell, I made a pot of coffee and the taste was just as bad as the smell.  I'm donating the unopened bags to a homeless shelter but I feel a little guilty subjecting anyone to this coffee.<br /><br />When I bought this coffee, I knew it wasn't going to be Kona or Blue Mountain but I didn't expect it to be this bad."
My cat loves this stuff!!!,"The chicken freeze dried medallions are great!  My cat loves these and goes nuts whenever he hears the bag open.<br /><br />The freeze dried medallions are only labelled for supplemental feeding, as they have not underwent feeding trials (per the customer service at Nature's Variety).  I tend to use these as a treat, or mix with the raw or Instinct canned.<br /><br />Serving is very simple.  Add warm water to rehydrate, wait about a minute and done.  You can also crumble to add over the top of other foods.  Storage is simple as well as the pouch has a zipper closure at the top.<br /><br />Customer service at Nature's Variety is also very helpful."
Not the same as the canned version,"I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond ""Roasted Almonds - Honey"" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW"">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very ""off"" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased."
"smooth, creamy very italian coffee","I use these coffee beans in a Saeco Vienna Automatic Espresso machine.  They produce a cup of espresso or as it is known in Italy ""cafe americano"" that has a cream on top, full flavored but never bitter. The Amazon price is unbeatable if you sign up for regular delivery"
Cat's Unhappy,I bought this cat food at Tractor Supply. My cats hate this food. They won't eat it.<br />It is so hard my cat's have a hard time trying to eat it. My cats are very unhappy with this food. I would not buy again.
Unappetizing Pink Biscuits Torpedo This Odd Variant on Shredded Wheat,"It's not quite as bad as I expected, but the Strawberry Delight flavor of the Frosted Mini-Wheats suffer most from how it looks, the unnatural pink color dyed into the wheat biscuits in such a way as to make them wholly unappetizing. Otherwise, it offers a sweetened taste that barely reminds me of real strawberries, at least to the point where you wonder what the point is to this variation from Kellogg's. One 42-gram serving, a mini-box, equals a higher-than-average 140 calories but only five are from fat. The other good news is that there is no measurable sodium and cholesterol to the cereal. I would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would be preferable to this cereal, so I think I'll leave this as a pass."
Tastes Like a Cheeseburger!,"I had the ultimate ""Taste-testers"" test this product......my grandkids.  They gave it a thumbs-up all the way.  It is super creamy & taste like a cheeseburger.  The 4 stars came from me......it gets a 5 star for taste.  I felt that it could have used more macaroni.  I almost cooked some more to add to it.  But, I guess less macaroni maybe helped to make it creamier.  We will definitely buy this again...it could be a meal all by itself."
My cats love this,"I have three cats,one that is overweight and I am trying to feed them better food with less fillers and fat. I tested 6 different companies cat food and this was the overall winner with all three.  I don't feed them much canned food and if I have leftovers I always refrigerate. This was one of the three that they would eat after refrigeration. Of the three this seemed to be the most healthy. They liked the Wellness brand and ProPlan(cheapest and had fillers and byproducts). This is the most expensive of the lot, but when you open the can you can actually see the prawns and the flakes of tuna it's worth the extra money."
Best Tea,I love this tea.  I have issues with added flowers and flavorings in other teas and Revolution teas tell you exactly whats in it and there are no additives!  I have been ordering from them ever since my first box of tea.  I take it to the office and I have a travel container and take it with me to restaurants.
"SPINACH EATERS, THEY ARE","My kitties are SPINACH EATERS, THEY ARE! And they love this Purina Pro Plan Chicken, Pasta (little balls of Pasta) and Spinach...little Spinach leaves are seen here and there. My cats like this well enough that they will eat it on an every other day basis. It isn't SO GREAT that they will eat it every day, day in and day out. But, if it is on a rotation where they get it every two or three days, then they will eat it and lap it all up. I do not mind rotating the food to keep them happy. So far, it has just been a matter of figuring out what they will eat and how often then will eat it. Then, with Amazon's wonderful Subscribe and Save capability, I just order and have items shipped every one, three, four or six months. I have finally found enough foods that I am able to order these and just sit back and watch them roll in!<br />Some of the kitty favs are:1, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TAD0B6"">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Turkey and Cheddar Cheese Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>2.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFN2O"">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food (Indoor Care), Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>(THIS SALMON IS AN EVERY DAY FOOD). 3.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KK4KI"">Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys for Cats, Florentine Collection with Garden Greens, 12-Count (Pack of 2)</a> 4.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1W8WI"">Tiki Cat Puka Puka Luau Chicken in Chicken Consomme (12/2.8oz Cans)</a>5.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00513J4PS"">Fussie Cat Premium Chicken with Vegetables & Brown Rice - 24 - 2.82-oz.

My kitties like many of the Pro Plan foods, and also really like the Fussie Cat offerings which are new to us!<br />So, my kitties, say Thank you for reading all this. Hope it will help you find things your kitty will like too. My cats are big lovers of the ""Chicken"" offerings. They Do like this Chicken, Pasta and Spinah meal! So say: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty!"
Mmmmm deliciously spicy,"I was looking for a tasty nacho cheese in a can smaller than the giant ones available at our local Costco.  I find the El Rio Hot Nacho Cheese to be perfect.  It's delicious, flavored with hot peppers.  And the smaller cans each make for two generous plates of tasty, tasty nachos.  Great stuff...I'm salivating for nachos as I write..."
YUCK!,"This fondant tastes horrible!  It has this really bitter after taste but before that after taste, it tastes like nothing...  YUCK!  I would not recommend this product to anyone."
ALMOST AS GOOD AS LLOYDS BBQed MEATS,To me Lloyds makes the best. But one can't just buy the sauce. One can only get their BBQed meats. All the grocery store BBQ sauces didn't come close and neither did one I bought on Amazon.<br />But this sauce is great! I just got it and now am putting a steak in the oven to have it for supper.
best pretzels in the worlds,love these bite sized pretzels.  can't find them in the stores in northern michigan.  thanks goodness for amazon.
My cats are hooked on this stuff,"I shudder to think what might happen if I ever run out of these treats.<br />For my cats, the day is not complete until we have had treat time with Temptations.<br />They let me know when it's time, loud and clear.<br />MEOW!<br />MEOW!<br />MEOW!<br />MEOW!"
These Are Awesome!,"We recently gave these a try after seeing them displayed at Starbucks.  I thought it would be handy to toss in the diaper bag for a just-in-case snack.  We pulled one out during a long day out with our 14 month old, and she sucked it down!  She even figured out rather quickly how to squeeze the bag and feed it to herself (with a little help when she reaches the end, of course), so we have ordered them by the case and will keep a few in the bag at all times!  A real lifesaver for those times we are stuck out without quick access to healthy snacks (these are entirely fruit - nothing else).  Great find, and slightly cheaper through Amazon."
Coffee taste alright,"This is my first shipment for this coffee.  I'm on a subscription basis.  Each K-Cup is flushed with nitrogen and then sealed in an air-tight, moisture-tight cup.  This lid is adhered to the top of the cartridge as soon as it is filled with fresh coffee or tea grounds, and the K-Cup remains air-tight and moisture-free until the needle of your Keurig brewer punctures the foil.  However in this shipment 35 of the 50 k-cups were deflated and lost there seal.  Not sure how fresh this coffee is since the seal was broken prior to shipment.  If the next shipment returns the same result I'll go back to paying more for a fresher product."
Highly recommended!,"Butter toffee is my second favorite coffee flavor (second to hazelnut).  As we go through a lot of coffee, we purchase our K-Cups in bulk so we're always looking for the best price per K-Cup.  We've tried other flavors from Gloria Jean's Coffees, and we have been satisfied with all of them so far.  We keep our K-Cups on the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E"">Keurig 5060 K-Cup Carousel, Chrome</a> so we're okay that the K-Cups ship in this box.  Highly recommended!"
Yum!  And cheap!,"If you've ever overpaid for a tiny bag of panko in the grocery store, consider stocking up on these excellent crumbs.  They are well packaged for long term storage (inner zipper bag inside box) and handle and taste great.  Well worth the money, especially if you get them on prime.  And yes, we cook constantly and have tried many different brands."
wrong description of product,"I only drink ginger tea. I tried this product even though it was labeled ""lemon ginger tea"". I don't think this tea has any ginger in it. The label reads Organic Lemon Ginger tea. Underneath it says: Contains: organic carob,organic chicory, organic S. African rooibos,lemon myrtle. This is not ginger tea and should not be labeled as such.<br /><br />b. Thomas"
Made my second purchase of this one,"These are very good Colombian whole beans, priced cheaper than what you can get in a comparable product at the grocery store. I like the taste just fine. With the subscribe price this is a good value IMO. Will buy more in the future."
Perfect for people with Celiac disease,I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and was having a hard time at restaurants; especially at my favorite Sushi restaurant. These little packets are a life saver. I have my sushi prepared dry and add my own Soy. Wala!<br />Only thing i would reccommend to the manufactured is to create a low sodium version.
nice suprise,"ordered this on a whim and found it to be a very good product,easy,fast with good flavor....oh and no MSG<br />works for me , i'm looking foward to trying the other products in line"
Best Jerky / Beef Steak! Best to buy it from Amazon!!,"I have not yet purchased this product FROM amazon, BUT as soon as my box from the Jack Link's Site is gone I will forever buy it from Amazon alone! This (Jack Link's ORINGINAL Beef Steak) is my absolute FAVORITE jerky and has been for years! I've spent way to much time and gas looking for it at near-by stores only to be disapointed and settling for either Jack Link's other products or O'Boy Oberto which are both fine, but for me it does NOTHING for my beef jerky cravings! It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective! On Amazon it is an amazing $10.00+ cheaper (when including shipping cost) than the same box from the Jack Link's website(kicking myself in the butt for that)! I will absolutely be setting up auto shipping for this product!"
The bags not contain only 8.1 ounces,Like the chips; however this last time the bags only contain 8.1 ounces not the 9 ounces that<br />the ad says.  That equates to a whole bag (10.8 ounces) is missing.  What gives?!?
One of the Best Keurig cups out there!,I have been trying many of the flavored Keurig cups since I bought my brewer. This is by far my favorite. Very smooth and you get the distinct taste of both caramel and vanilla. Highly recommended!
WOW!,This coffee has a great flavor!  I am not sure if I would say creme brulee but it is very good.  Its not overpowering or weak.  Its perfect!
Great for stomach problems!,My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!
Baking bread just got easier,"I wish I would find out about this product earlier. Bread I make raises perfectly every time, which was not the case without it.<br />Despite the ""chemical"" name it is just a flour with the starch removed in case you are concerned."
We love these oats!,"The price for these oats on subscribe and safe is great and we love this product.  My little one enjoys her oatmeal, and these are tasty and quick to make. I usually boil the oats in a mixture of milk and water to add to the taste, and I add some fresh fruit after boiling. A wonderful breakfast, lunch, or evening snack."
Nut-tastic,"These are great.  Not dry or hard (like brittle), but rather nuts held together with a softer goo of honey and sugar.  More sweet that salty. Good balance of nut flavors, with (as you'd expect from planters) peanut being the dominant taste. So it's not a pure health bar due to the sugars, but it's better than a pure candy bar thanks to the nut protein and fiber."
surprising,"that they made a real NATURAL product..it only has one added ingredient,salt, and it does taste a tad bit too salty for me, however, it tastes great and it's easy to swallow if you like to eat it out of the jar like me.  If you're a first time buyer, do not try stirring it...too thick, open it and then place it upside down in the fridge. The oil will go to the top, keep in mind it's upside down so when you are ready to open it the oil will then be on the bottom and the top will be nice and creamy. =]"
"Gorgeous Bamboo, Perfect for Home or Office","I bought this bamboo because it was inexpensive, and I needed something low-maintenance to keep at the office.  It is absolutely beautiful!  Mine came shaped in the ""fence"" design as advertised, but also had two pieces of bamboo shaped into a heart!<br /><br />I liked that it was sold without a vase, so I could pick out my own design.  I bought a really nice rectangular vase and black river rocks at Target for less than $20.00.  I would absolutely recommend buying this for yourself or a friend!"
Great product and price,"I use my Lavazza BLUE espresso machine every day and was thrilled that Amazon now carries this product. Arrived promptly and the box of 100 pods was fresh/long expiration date and at a price considerably less than offered in the Chicago area. Produces a perfect, great tasting shot of espresso with good crema every time. Would highly recommend but you must have a Lavazza BLUE machine."
Tasty Low-Fat Granola,"For some reason, the package of these ""healthy grains"" doesn't use the word ""granola.""<br /><br />Funny -- the product sure looks, smells, and tastes like granola to me.<br /><br />But I notice it's very low-fat -- maybe that's the distinction.<br /><br />And it does seem to include some unusual ingredients -- amaranth, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds.  I don't believe I've ever HEARD of some of those before!<br /><br />The package suggests that you can eat this stuff with milk -- as cereal -- or on top of yogurt, or just straight out of the pack.<br /><br />I chose the latter, and it made for a tasty snack, to be sure.  This vanilla-blueberry flavor is unusual and not too sweet, with a hint of a burnt flavor.<br /><br />The only reason I deducted one star from my score is the high price -- more than five bucks for an 11-ounce package.  That's not much more than regular granola, but then I think that most regular granola is stupidly overpriced as well.<br /><br />At any rate, if you'd like to try a tasty low-fat granola-like snack -- and you have the discretionary income -- this may be just your KIND of granola."
Pappadam,"We love all Pappadams!!!!!!  Besides fried, you can cook them in microwave ( a few seconds) and one of our favorite is to break up a couple of them into soup stock as noodles. This is a first rate brand!"
My dog's favorite treat!,My dog has a wheat allergy and these are the best treats I have found! He loves them! He is an 80lb boxer and boxes still seem to last a long time!
Good Tasting Sugar Free Cookies - Recommended,"Murray ""Sugar Free Fudge Dipped Vanilla Wafer Cookies"" are a good tasting, diabetic friendly, snack food.<br /><br />While not quite a good as regular fudge dipped wafers, having a slightly odd after taste, these are quite acceptable.<br /><br />Recommended!"
BAD PACKAGING,The packaging for the Organic Steel Oats was awful.  When I opened the box every single container was opened and there were oats everywhere.  One more thing: the oats were packaged with 12 can of soup.  Poor combination.  No wonder why they burst open.  Amazon must do a better job of protecting the contents for shipment.  They may have already been punctured.  I will return the item.<br /><br />Update: I contacted Amazon about the packaging. Amazon responded to my e-mail within 3 hours. I requested the oats be replaced. Amazon apologized about the packaging and are sending a new shipment. Thank you Amazon for your customer service.
Look around in local asian supermarkets,"I have been drinking Temple of Heaven for several decades and have found this tea on the shelf in local asian supermarkets. If you don't want to wait for delivery, locate an asian supermarket and check it out. But once on the program, buying from amazon makes for convenience when you determine how fast your consumption is."
Just like the old days . . .,"This was my favorite comfort food as a child and has not changed over the past 30 years.  The quality of the pasta is poor, but I'm partial to the sauce spice packets which did not disappoint."
They love it!!,My three picky cats have finally all agreed on one they love!  I have been feeding them this for about 8 months now and they are happy and healthy.  They don't vomit as much after eating and their output is not as large.  Their coats seem nice.  I ran out of this and gave them a grocery store brand again and only one ate some (without enthusiasm) and the other two just looked at me like I was crazy.  Lol.  Had to run to petstore to get this :-). Amazon is cheaper than petstore though and there is no tax & free shipping (prime).
These are the real deal!!!  Great Snack.,"After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but ""popped"",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!"
Great Formula,"By 6 months I was ready to be done with the pump!!!  We started supplementing our daughter (slow transition to 50% Baby's Only/ 50% frozen breast milk)increasing the Baby's Only about 2 oz a day for a week.  Our daughter seems to really like it - she is not a picky eater.  No problems with constipation.  We were sure to give the Baby's Only probiotics as well to help with the transition.  We like that Baby's Only takes it easy on the synthetic stuff and that the DHA comes from a human food source (eggs).  Also, the Baby's Only with DHA has some (2mg/ 5 oz I think) Cholesterol which is found in breast milk, but not other formula.  I think only the plus DHA kind has the cholesterol.  I would recomend this for an older baby."
"Tasty refuel after exercise or liven up a lunch; 100% juice, 0% bad stuff","As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">Black Cherry</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ"">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4"">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y"">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon."
Made in China treats still KILLING dogs - ABC NEWS 2012!,"Yes, dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china.  This company is aware of the stigma behind products made in china but they're not going to bring their manufacturing to the US until consumers care enough about their dogs to stop buying this product.<br /><br />Per ABC News;<br />Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.<br /><br />The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March. The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]"
Great product!,"I wasn't sure about getting this product due to price and the fact that I had to buy it by the 6 pack, but my toddler started pre-school and isn't allowed to have Nutella due to school policy.  I finally ordered it and WOW!  We all love it, even my finicky mother!  Great product and I don't see it lasting long in my house!!  Compared to Nutella it is less expensive and I think it tastes much better.  Good texture, taste is great; it isn't too sweet and is not oily or runny."
It's good.,I only added a review of this product in order to make sure that the number of stars it has is increased.  This text is useless to you in your deliberations.
Great Keto or Low-carb snack,"A great flavor and 4g net carbs, 2g sugars. Nearly guilt-free snacking and an awesome amount of fat. These aren't the ideal nut for low-carb and/or keto diets, macadamias are probably closer, but these are much more widely available and the flavors make it easier to snack reasonably."
Tropical Treat,"If you love coconut, then this is for you.  As a bona fide coco-'nut', I can tell you this product is delicious...crispy and lightly sweet wide flakes.  The drawbacks are that the bag contains a pretty small amount and the pieces are brittle and break.  That being said, the coconut is great for snacking or garnishing desserts/baked goods."
BENECOL CHEWS 120ct,Once ordered I was updated regularly by email as to item's availability and when it would be shipped. Upon arrival everything was perfect. THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!
best vinegar ever!,this moscatel vinegar is wonderful tasting.  it is so good you want to eat bread with it or even drink it....i personally think this is the best vinegar ever!
Better than Candy,"I have replaced candy bars with the Kind Bars, and they are better.  My favorite are Nut Delight.  The ones with chocolate are my least favorite."
Does as advertised,"The Dr. Oz recommendation in a women's health magazine stated it expands in the stomach and makes one feel full.  It works, but caution, use a small amount as it makes you overly stuffed and uncomfortable."
great seasoning for popcorn,I use this every day on my popcorn along with a butter spray to make it stick.  It is sooooo good.
Great flavor,I got a free variety pack of K-cups when I bought my machine and tried this one. Awesome flavor. It's like warm and smoky. A different flavor than I'm used to. I'm buying this one now!
Beats the heck out of the tap!,"I have to take several pills each day and the rusty dirt that the local municipal water company seeps out of our kitchen faucets doesn't particularly further my eagerness to swallow them. Choosing instead to use Gatorade or the Mio water flavoring is neither ideal or inexpensive in the long run either. I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find the Essentia pH Drinking water a nice alternative to flavorings plus the bottle that was supplied by Amazon was much larger than I expected. At the current price point this offers very good value for money especially when compared to the little 8oz bottles you can get at the store.<br /><br />Now I can't comment on the additional positives added by the pH levels boasted on the bottle, nor can I honestly say whether this water tastes 'good' compared to others. It tastes like clean water. I can say that some of the pills I take (steroids) taste awful so it's nice to be able to down them with a cold refreshing bit of aqua instead of brown sludge or sickly sweet drinks.<br /><br />Ultimately, if like me, your water supply is less than stellar then you can't go wrong with this brand for cost or quantity."
A good crema coffee,"Doing research, I found that ""crema"" is the froth or foam that comes out of some espresso machines. Being thicker, espresso can create more foam or froth when it brews in commercial coffee shop machines, and this foam or froth (called ""crema"") is enjoyed for it's own qualities in Europe as it floats atop the espresso.<br /><br />The Signature Crema Coffee t-discs from Gevalia creates a slightly smaller sized cup of coffee with a ""head"" on it. The Tassimo machines are capable of pumping air through the water, creating froth or foam. Creamer discs usually take advantage of this to make cappucino with frothed cream. The crema coffees, like this one, froth the brew, giving a good amount of foam. The roast is relatively smooth and a little stronger than the Signature Blend, and the serving size a little smaller. Most likely, it brews a little less coffee so as not to dilute the froth, and that gives it a slightly stronger flavor.<br /><br />If you like coffee with a head or froth on it, these will yield good results. I keep a few on hand for novelty or a change of pace (or when I forget and run out of the regular coffee). Crema is a different type of coffee though as the air being pumped through the brew does alter it slightly. If you enjoy coffee with cream and sugar, you most likely will not enjoy this. If you enjoy black coffee, then chances are much better you'll appreciate this one."
coffee,We got the coffee in just a few days.  It is exactly what we had purchased in the grocery store and at almost half the price. Well worth it
Delicious!,"I bought this juice to make a drink my wife and I had while in Bora Bora, French Polynesia. It was called ""Tahiti Drink"" and the ingredients called for passion fruit amongst other things. The juice was priced very reasonably and arrived quickly and well packaged. The juice itself was delicious. One reviewer stated it was too sweet, I dont believe this to be true at all. It does have some sweetness to it but by no means is it too sweet. It is very refreshing, has a good balance of acidity and sweetness and did the job in recreating the Tahiti drink."
Delicious and low carb too!!!,"Bob's Red Mill Low Carb Bread is excellent!!  Full of fiber, flavor and protein!  I have this item on an automatic delivery and save even more money!"
My dogs like these,I have one lab and one beagle and they liked these rawhides. They are a good thickness and kept them busy for awhile. My dogs are 12 and 13 years old and they had no problems or issues with this product as another reviewer has stated (maybe a bad batch?). They finished an entire bag and I just ordered another.
CONTAINS KILLER HYDROGENATED OIL!!!,"How they can advertise this product as ""healthy"" when it contains hydrogenated oil is beyond me. Clearly they have sold their souls to the devil. Because the FDA (also in the devil's pocket) allows products to advertise ""no trans fat"" when the amount of trans fat per serving is .5 g or less, these people can get away with lying to the American public. Weight Watchers is also to blame for endorsing ANY product with hydrogenated oil in it.<br /><br />READ YOUR LABELS CAREFULLY, FOLKS: corporations don't care about your health."
perfect for its use,keeps well on the truck in the heat for months without going bad. does get caked in the pack but a little squish before pouring into your water and good to go. I mix it into a little warm water then put that into cold water. remember mixing in cold doesnt work so well. no cal. ok taste and average mineral content. I haven't found anything better and working outside the past 12 years I have been on the lookout for anything to help. dont forget real mineral caplets if you get heat cramps = work better than ANY drink.
Cashew Bars,These bars were so tasty that all my coworkers fell in love with them.  They went out and bought some for themselves but didn't bother to share.  Next time I order I'll keep them at home instead of at work.
Best Cocoa Powder!,This is the best cocoa powder on the market.  My cakes have so much more flavor and depth.  I will never go back to buying any other brand.
Cola gummies...YUM!,What a great deal on a favorite treat. I love these things and is was an incredible value from Amazon.
sodastream diet rootbeer,"The diet rootbeer is not as good as the other diet flavors, such as diet grapefruit, which had a nice flavor. Diet rootbeer is bitter. The flavor is also weak, compared to the other diet flavors. If you add more to get the full flavor, the bitterness of the after taste is horrible. I would not recommend this flavor to anyone, so very disappointing."
Great for baking,"This stuff if great for baking if you have special dietary needs. It doesn't alter the flavor of any baked goods but it is easier to burn them so you have to be careful when baking. Not so good for sweetening drinks though, maybe with hot drinks it'd be better."
Good Tasting Pretzels,Gluten Free Glutino Pretzel Twists-<br />The best tasting pretzels - they are crispy & have a good flavor.
Small,"It had prompt shipping, but was smaller than the picture portrayed. Still small, heavy box; arrived quickly and in one piece. Can't wait to try them on Christmas!"
Bully Sticks,My Irish Setter eats this treat slowly and it is the perfect fit for her.  My Lab gets the braided stick because he is more aggressive with his treats.  The Setter gets one each evening and is very satisfied with it.  Worth the money I pay for this product
Pretty Good Taste,This product is okay.  Not my favorite coffee but with the Tassimo you only get so many Brands to choose from on an office budget.  I order this for the company and most here are okay with it.
Not the best,"OK, but not the best.  Does not taste all that much like Pumpkin Spice though, pretty dissapointed.  I will not buy it again, but not a complete waste of money."
Very nutritious and convenient,"I was really happy to have these Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried chicken treats when my dog wasn't feeling well and wasn't eating a lot of food.  I broke them into little pieces and gave them to her as a snack.  She likes stuff like this much better when she thinks it is a treat, rather than presenting it as a meal.  I have purchased other Nature's Variety products quite often in the past, but this is my first time getting the freeze dried treats.  I like that meat, fruit, and vegetables are the main ingredients and feel confident in feeding this to my dog.  The only reason I removed a star from the rating is because of the price.  It is quite expensive for the amount offered.  I will probably continue to buy another brand (Stella & Chewy's) freeze dried options because the price, while still high, is much better for the amount of product and my dog seems to like them both the same."
Save Your Money!!!,"Saw these on Amazon and thought they would make great gifts for my nieces and nephew. When they arrived, the box was dirty and scuffed up. The corners of the boxes were caved in. I guess the saying ""learn the hard way"" comes into play here, buy local not online!"
Just right for me!,"Everyone including myself, hubby and visitors always love this Dolce Gusto Capsule flavor the most. It is not too strong but has the right amount of flavor and enough froth too that I can give my little one a few spoons of it when she is eying my coffee. If you are looking for a stronger one then put less water."
TOTALLY LOVE POPCHIPS!,"I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again."
Great tasting coffee,"Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for my wife and me this is the best tasting hazelnut coffee that we have ordered. It has a nice aroma, distinctive hazelnut taste that is not too weak or too strong, and a very smooth taste (not bitter at all). This is a great coffee to start your day or to enjoy with some cake or pie for dessert.<br /><br />When I ordered the 50 count pack, I didn't realize that the K cups came loose in a big box. That is not a convenient way for me to store them, so next time I will probably order two 24 count boxes that I can stack up in my closet along with the other K cup flavors that I have.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon of $29.99 is about the same as on various internet sites, but as a Prime member I don't pay shipping (as you have to do on the internet sites unless you spend a certain amount that is much more than the cost of this product), so for me it is a good deal."
Yummy,"I just love my Keurig coffee maker.  I find myself drinking coffee at home instead of buying expensive drinks at my neighborhood Starbucks.  I always loved their cafe mocha, but it is just loaded with calories.  I was thrilled when I found this product.  It is low in calories and delicious.  If you are a Weight Watchers person, you can have a cup of this with some fat free whipped topping for just two points.  Incredible.  I have it as a mid afternoon treat."
"Can't beat it, delicious raw pure honey!","Raw pure honey that has an excellent flavor.  For the shipment, each dispenser container was separately bubble wrapped. Received in perfect condition.  Gave as gifts, too!"
Organic Wigs,"I bought 238 Barbara's Bakery Multigrain Fig Bars, Wheat Free, Fat Free, 12-Ounce Boxes, for my pet green iguana. Unfortunately, he died as a result from too much grease intake a few weeks before. So I was stuck with the 238 Boxes.<br /><br />Multigrain is not my favorite but these are really fresh, good and tasty. They are sweet and taste natural. Very good product.<br /><br />My neighbor, Halbert, who is part of the fat acceptance movement, invited himself over to eat them since they expire in 3 months. He clocks in at 560 lbs. He comes over to watch TV and eat these, imposing himself upon my company, which is annoying.<br /><br />So far, no complaints and he has gas problems, which I found out. The organic figs help him out I think. Hopefully he'll finish eating them soon so he can stop bothering me."
Too much fish/chicken meals for the price,I sure wish I had researched the ingredients first. There is a large amount of fish meal and chicken meal in this supposedly high quality food. I expect to see non-meal meat by products when paying this price.
Awesome. Totally hit the spot everytime.,I love these bars - especially the cranberry bars. I allow myself 1 per day. I think everyone is getting a box for Christmas.
"Sweet, yes. Alpine, not so much.","I've been suffering through an incredibly hot season, more sauna than summertime. I've had enough sweat rolling down my back to charge neighborhood kids three bucks a pop for a Slip 'N' Slide ride, and I'm finally at the end of my sweaty rope. I came here looking for something, anything, to help me beat the summer heat.<br /><br />I've watched those Peppermint Pattie commercials for years. Eating one gives 'the sensation of shushing down a snow-capped mountain,' they say. It's like 'yodeling in the frigid Alpine snow,' they tell me. It feels like 'a giant soothing Sno-Cone down your pants on a hot August afternoon'. So they say, in these commercials.<br /><br />Hogwash.<br /><br />On a particularly sweltering recent afternoon, I put their advertising to the test. I ate forty-six of these little patties -- and I got a 'sensation', all right. Not of skiing or crooning or cooling my undies, though. More like the feeling of three pounds of chocolate crammed down my colon, and a faint minty tinge to all five senses. You ever HEARD peppermint? I can't recommend it.<br /><br />Bottom line: Eat a Pattie if you're looking for a nice sweet treat. But if you're suffering through a summertime heat wave? Drop in a Sno-Cone. Your colon -- and your BVDs -- will thank you."
delicious hot chocolate,This product is surprisingly delicious being made from water and not milk.  I was absolutely surprised at how good it is.
Best litter box from Amazon,"This litter box has two pans in the bottom with a sifting pan.  It makes it easy to sift the litter, put the mess into a trash bag, then put the sifter in the second pan and pour the sifted litter into the other pan with the sifter in it. You change it back and forth each time.  The top keeps the cat from throwing litter out as he covers his deposit and also you don't have to look at the mess.  It's easy to change and the cat likes his privacy too.  I had purchased one about a year ago for my daughter's cat, but when I looked for one for my new cat, the only place I could find it was at Amazon."
"Tastes like it is supposed to, but not a flavor or aftertaste that I enjoy at all.","I am giving this product 4 stars because it is what it says that it is.  If I was judging it on my personal preference for the combination of ginger and lemon flavor, it would get 1 or 2 stars from me.<br /><br />If you like Ginger and like the strong aftertaste and sensation that drinking ginger gives you, than you will like this product.  The initial lemon ginger flavor is very good, by any standard.  The aftertaste of ginger and the odd, flemy sensation that it leaves in your throat is not appealing to me."
great stuff,this is great stuff. It is low in sugar  and a few spoonfuls goes a long way. It is a healthy snack for any time of day.
Great stuff,"this is some great seasoning.  Try it, you will like it. You can put it on about anything.  what else can I say?"
Loacker Quadratini Hazelnut Wafers,"I have to say I was looking forward to getting my favorite cookie, without paying the local $4.89 per package.  I always buy from Amazon whenever the price is right, and they have what I want.  The packages of wafers came as expected, however when I got them, one package had it's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh.  The other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had slid off of each other, causing a ""slanted' wafer.  Not the upright wafer cookie I expected.  All in all, I will take a second look before I buy eatable items from Amazon."
Much better than Emerald chocolate almonds,"The Blue Diamond Dark Chocolate almonds are ridiculously good. The taste is heads above the emerald chocolate nuts. Although they are around the 7 dollar range I think they are worth it. They use stevia to sweeten the almonds which is a plant based sweetener. Not only are they  much better for you, they taste better than Emerald's splenda sweetened (eww). If they would lower the price a bit I would be ecstatic. Enjoy!"
Good flavor!,"First off i have to say I am not a coffee drinker, but I tried this with a couple other people and we all agreed that it tasted better than the Starbucks cans. It was just right, not too bitter, not to sweet, and the coffee taste was some of the best i have had. It is also better than the frapuccino's that come in the glass bottles. Overall a great drink for coffee and non-coffee drinkers. Enjoy!"
The Greatest Flavor in K-Cups,"Have purchased this many times over and totally love it! Can't wait to try the other new flavors that Emeril has to offer! Very happy!<br /><br />Automatic delivery is the best! Great price, awesome ship time; thank you Amazon!!!"
Great flavor,"It's a LOT of licorice, but I like the flavor and will be happy to work my way through that big bag. I'm pleased with this product."
Worth the price,"I adopted a 6 month-old dalmation-pit recently and when I brought him home he had watery, disgusting smelling stools. I tried Natural Balance, which didn't really make a difference, and Before Grain, which he liked but it didn't have any effect on his poop. I did some research and decided to try the chicken super5mix and after mixing it into his food for about a week or so his stools became significantly less watery and it takes him about half the time to do his business than before (where I would watch him struggle and it looked painful and sad :( wonder what they fed him at the shelter ). He's my first puppy and I noticed that after a long time in the sun/we go out for a jog, he would have this weird funky smell like rotting chicken. I'm guessing that's his sweat smell. After about two weeks on Wellness the smell decreased SIGNIFICANTLY! His coat is also glossier. Leonidas hasn't been on this food for that long so I'm a bit hesitant to attribute the change just to food.. but I really think that's what it is. Bought the 15-lb bag to test it out last time, just ordered the 30. I'll try to remember to update this after he finishes it :)<br /><br />P.S. he also has MUCH less gas. win-win for both Leonidas and myself (but more for myself)"
Stash Green Tea,"I bought this tea for my husband because he loves tea...and I tried some too and I have to say that I love this tea.  It tastes great and is smooth and in my opinion this tea is very good quality it has a slightly sweet flavor which I find very pleasing and it comes with 120 tea bags.. I'm really glad that I bought the Stash green tea brand.  I highly recommend it.  Also, I have to give amazon props because they did great on their shipping, very fast."
Toast in a dry skillet; make with coffee and cream,"Coach's Oats' patented procedures produce some very well-textured oatmeal--the best I've had.<br /><br />Here's my method of preparing them:<br />Toast ~1.5 Cups raw Coach's Oats in a dry stainless-steel medium pot. Add ~3/4 tsp of Kosher Salt.<br />Add 3 Tbsp of Coconut Oil and/or Macadamia Oil and/or Butter. Stir until toasted and brown.<br />In a separate container, microwave 3 cups of water and 1 cup of black coffee to a boil (4 cups total).<br />Pour the boiling liquid over the oats in the hot cooking vessel. Instant violent boil. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.<br />Remove lid and stir in cinnamon (e.g. cassia) and ~4 Tbsp Orange Blossom Honey.<br />Simmer uncovered for ~4 more minutes until desired texture consistency is reached. I like mine on the drier side.<br />Serve with a splash of cream and/or berries. Or anything that will stand up to the coffee flavor. Have fun."
Delicious,"These are delicious. Arrived as stated. Excellent buy on Subscribe and Save. Great for those looking for ""Gluten free"" products."
Some great penut butter!,"Hadn't had the chance to try Skippy natural with honey since my local stores don't carry it, so when I saw the six pack deal on Amazon I couldn't pass it up!<br /><br />Now I won't buy any other brand or any other kind, this stuff is DELICIOUS!!"
my tap water is 8.6 pH already anyway...,"I tried this water and it tasted just ""normal"" to me. Not silky or special or anything.<br /><br />I gave my cats two bowls of water, each with 16 oz of water, one the Essentia and one of just tap water. I saw them drink out of both bowls and water disappeared from both bowls at the same rate.<br /><br />I looked up the pH of my local tap water and it tests between 6.7 and 9.7 pH with an average of 8.6, not so different from this bottle of water but a heck of a lot cheaper.<br /><br />It really seems to me like somewhere around the early 1990s we were all duped into buying bottled water. Some water isn't safe to drink and so it's good that we can get bottled water at times, but it somehow became a status symbol and then a necessity. Now people are either realizing maybe it's dumb to buy bottled water when the bottled water industry isn't even as well regulated as tap water, or moving on to other beverages as ""plain"" water is starting to seem a little boring, so what do the people who sell water do to sell more product? They make it fancier, with caffeine or gathered in glacial melt and harvested from the deep sea, or, it seems, with a high pH.<br /><br />There are all kinds of health claims made about high pH water, but as far as I know there aren't any reputable, scientific studies that back up any of the claims. If there were, I'm sure Essentia would be shouting those claims from the rooftops to sell their product.<br /><br />If you really believe you need water with a pH of 9.5, maybe research what the tap water in your area already is, and if it's not high enough for you there are many options for water ionizers you can purchase in all price ranges."
The best licorice,"I found this product at Whole Foods and really liked it, but it was discontinued and I had to search online.  I have never found a better tasting licorice product.  It is soft and delicious."
ONE OF OUR OLD STAND-BYS.  We enjoy this coffee and have many uses for the empty containers.,"I like coffee and my wife likes coffee.  Despite the fact that we were warned, starting at a very early age, that coffee would ""stunt our growth"" and do all kinds of horrible things to our growing little bodies, both of us starting drinking coffee at a very early age.  No, it did not stunt our growth or have any of the other horrid side effects on us in later life.  It did, when I was a wee one, make me rather hyper but I suspect I would have been that way anyway. I have always been in a state hovering between that of giant tree sloth and a crazed ferret...depending on what day of the week it is seemingly.<br /><br />Anyway, as things stand now we still drink quite a lot of coffee with two large pots being consumed daily.  To be quite honest, over the years we have been more inclined to purchase what ever brand was on sale at the time although our two old stand-bys have always been Folgers and Maxwell House.  Of the two, this Folgers French grind (Dark or Medium Dark) probably has the edge over the rest...when we can get it.  Both of us simply like the flavor better.<br /><br />Now that being said and truth be told, the breaking point as to whether or not you like a certain brand of coffee greatly depends upon what you get use to.  I know full well that many swear by the process of buying their own beans, grinding their coffee to suit their taste and proceeding from there.  I do not doubt for a second that this is good coffee...I have had coffee prepared this way many times and it is indeed good.  For us though, the process of going through this, the extra cost of having a quality coffee grinder, the time involved and the extra cost of the truly fresh coffee beans, simply is not worth the trouble...that is just us though and our particular life style.<br /><br />No, we will stick to this stuff and the Maxwell House.  It is what we are use to; it is what we enjoy.  We will switch from on to the other, depending which is on sale at the time.  I must say, the cost of this coffee here on Amazon, if you belong to one of the free shipping programs, is quite attractive and quite competitive.<br /><br />I also like the empty plastic containers and have dozens of uses for them around the house.<br /><br />And no, we did not let our children or grandchildren start drinking coffee at an early age...we feared that it would stunt their growth and do horrid things to their growing bodies.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great product and meets our needs perfectly.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"
"Recipe Changed - Now, Too Much Starch and Potatoes","Upon receiving this pea soup, I was disappointed to learn that the recipe has been changed from the one currently listed here on Amazon. Now, cheap potatoes, rice starch and tasteless lentils have been added to the product ingredients, as additional fillers; giving the soup the consistency of a bowl of starchy mashed potatoes. I don't mind ""some"" potatoes, but there are just too many spuds and starches in this ""pea"" soup.<br /><br />If you like the consistency and flavor of thick mashed potatoes, this soup is for you.<br /><br />Note that the positive reviews you are reading here apply to the product BEFORE the Recipe and Ingredients were changed for the worse!"
not that deep,I bought this at the health food store and the only reason I didn't like it was because of the smell. It smelled like flowers and I couldn't get past it enough to keep it once I smelled it. I am more of a fruity girl and the flowers were just too much.
Tasty but salty,"The taste is good and not too hot.  My only problem is the sodium in 1 tsp is 260mg or 11% of the daily allowance.  A sodium-free product would be much better IMHO.  This product is really salty on the palate.<br /><br />If you mix it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZVOR8"">Pomi Chopped Tomatoes, 26.46 Ounce Tetra Pack (Pack of 12)</a> and garlic, you get a good Arrabiata sauce.<br /><br />This is about half as hot as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018P4EK8"">Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce Huy Fong 17 Oz.</a>"
Torani Suryp,I haven't tried the syrup as it is to make Mai Tai's with but it did arrive very quickly. Great service!!
Sweet Delight...It's Pretty Good!,"This was a Manager's Special for cheap (two bucks a box) that I gave a try. It has milled cane sugar as the second ingredient BUT that is soooo much better than High Fructose Corn Syrup for the human body. It's sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth or two. My teenager will eat ONE bowl and be satisfied versus ""inhaling"" bowls and bowls of fruity loopy stuff. I enjoy it because there's 26 of the recommended daily 48 grams of whole grains per serving, it's all natural, no preservatives, a good source of protein, and a ""good"" sweet taste. Kids and grown-ups BOTH like this straight out of the box, as a hot or cold cereal with milk, mixed in yogurt, and sprinkled on ice cream!"
Arrived broken,"I left packaging review stating that the bottles came broken, but with no response, so I can only assume that this is the normal course of action, and do not recommend that anyone purchase this product without expecting to receive a well soaked box of soy cardboard."
"Very nice bold, non-bitter coffee","Review Update: 1-12-2011 When I bought these originally, they were sold directly from Amazon, and therefore were eligible for super saver shipping. They were also eligible for subscribe & save. Since then, the price has apparently DOUBLED (from $21.25 for 3 boxes) to almost $50. Fifty dollars is totally unacceptable for three boxes of these, I don't care how good they are. Don't know if Amazon is going to sell this again themselves, but if they don't, Dolce Gusto may yet go the way of the Senseo. Great coffee, now nearly extinct in the US. Watch your prices, especially on subscribe & save with these!<br /><br />If you like a bold coffee, but not a bitter coffee, these Americano capsules are great. I like the stronger (and somewhat bitter) caffe lungo capsules, but I also like these. They couldn't be described as wimpy or weak, as I feared they might be when I tried them. They have a very nice bold flavor in their own right without being bitter in the least. Caveat: Don't try filling up a huge mug using only one capsule - the dolce gusto recipe book calls for 6oz of water with these. So if you have a super large mug, you may have to use two to get your preferred amount of coffee. Unless you're like my husband and like really weak coffee. If you do, brew away! But if brewed properly, they aren't weak and wimpy. Very nice! I'd recommend for mild to bold coffee drinkers who don't like bitter."
"Great treat, but probably not for small dogs","These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites."
The worst solid albacore ever,"This is bad tuna, can't say it any better. It's flavor and smell tend to be very strong, not what you expect from the top of the line tuna they make. The chunk light they make is slightly better. 1 in 4 cans actually are solid albacore, the other 3 are made up of mush, I can't even call it chunk style. I don't eat tuna in salads or sandwiches, I eat it out of the can. When I buy solid albacore, I expect that, this brand can't be trusted to give quality time after time. DON'T BUY."
Describe the taste in one word......,"Yuck!<br /><br />I have used the stevita stevia supreme packets in the past and they were great! So I assumed the liquid would be good too. Big mistake. There is a ""motor oil"" aftertaste with the liquid! Please save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Taste is spot,It's a good tasting peanut butter when mixed by a 1:1 ratio with water (sometimes added a bit of Truvia to make it sweeter) but didn't provide nearly as many servings as it says it will. i probably only got 9 out of it.
Perfect compliment to my vodka,"I am a dirty martini drinker. I love vodka with my ""salad."" I received a package with 2 bottles of Dirty Sue for my birthday and it is fantastic. First of all, its nice that I don't have to use olive juice that fingers have been in digging out olives. Secondly, it taste great. The flavor is clean and just right so neither the vodka nor the brine overpower the other. I now keep a bottle at my favorite bar so my bartender, Ryan, can make a perfect martini. Great job guys. You have a loyal customer."
great product from a great company,"great purchase and a great value from a wonderful company who stands behind their product.<br />Had four of the trays for about five months, and they were in CONSTANT use. We definitely got our money's worth!!<br /><br />After five months, we had a little issue with a funny smell (it did not smell like any of the food we froze) so I tossed the trays.  Scandinavian Child replaced them immediately.  they even tried to match the colors we had!<br />they REALLY stand behind their product. Their customer service was amazing; their genuine helpfulness and accountability for their product is so refreshing!!<br /><br />I look forward to having they trays again, and I would definitely recommend them."
pleased with purchase,My order arrived quickly and was just as it looked and was described in the ad.  I would order again from this company.
It sure is - Kitty Crack!,"I first learned about this product a year ago, and I've been giving it to my cats ever since. They get it once a day as a treat, and they love it. If there is a flavor of food that they may not be too crazy about, and I have nothing better to give them at a moment, then this will do the trick. I sprinkle it on top and they will eat it all no matter what. Also, when I clip their nails they get it for putting up with it, as well as if there is some special occassion. In overall, this is the best treat that I've ran accross, safe, apparently tasty, and one box can last me over a month, for two cats. I wish I could find it in local pet food stores."
Trustworthy and Quality,"Finally a product I trust, that will give my Westies the nutrition they need without the added junk!  My boys have already showed signs of more energy."
"OK, but not Great","I bought this tea on a subscribe/save deal and received the 6 boxes at less than $1.00 a box.  The tea is rainforest certified so I appreciate the effort to help farmers.  That said, the tea has no actual superfruit in it and doesn't taste very strongly of the natural flavors that were added to make it taste like Black Currant and Vanilla.  For a daily dose of green tea 2 times a day which is the routine I use, it is fine for drinking but I don't look forward to tasting it each time I pull it out."
YUM!,"Hard to find a tropical fruit in freeze dried concoctions!  This combination of mango and strawberries has something for me and something for my kids.  It is a little expensive, but so worth it!  YUM!"
"Astringent, weak tea","I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like, I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried."
"Good chips, terrible packaging","Chips are good, but Amazon ships them in their original ""ready to ship"" box, which turns out is not really so ready for shipping. The box arrived in tatters; miraculously, the chips survived relatively intact. Hopefully will continue to be so lucky in the future."
Never Thought I'd LIke Something Other than Quacker,"My wife and I picked up some packages of these of the dollar store and weren't sure if they'd be a good deal or not. Were very pleasantly surprised. I almost exclusively eat Quaker apple cinnamon oatmeal, but I really liked this.<br /><br />I have to comment on the great packaging idea of this product comes in. First, if you care it's post have lower amount of packaging than comparable products and be better for the environment. Anyway, the thing I really do like about this is the pouches are also the measuring cup. You take a bowl, tear the pouch open, dump out the contents, then you fill be empty pouch with water up to a line on the pouch, dump it in the bowl, stir and then nuke it for 90 seconds. I don't know why nobody is ever thought of this before in any of the packaging I've seen, but it saves the guessing at how much water to put in or caring stupid measuring cup around with you if you're eating it work like I do. My only minor gripe is the line it asks you to tear at isn't the area that had the tear point so I mistook the tear line for the fill line and put in too much water the first four or five times I used it.<br /><br />When we went back to the store we picked up another three boxes pulled me out for the next few weeks. Give the stuff a try. You won't regret it!"
good anti-dandruff shampoo,"This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear. Overall, this is a good anti-dandruff shampoo and I would recommend it."
Strong enough for 12oz + cups,"I need to drink decaf in the morning and use a larger travel mug for my early cups of coffee.  While regular decafs dilute on the Keurig 12oz setting, I find the Emeril's decaf stays strong.  While I am concerned about the recent jump in K-Cup prices and Green Mountain's new monopoly, I can't take that out on the review of the taste of this product."
Did not like flavor.,"This drink mix works as well as products similar to it.  The powder is difficult to get disolved completly, but can be done.  I did not like the flavor, way more banana than strawberry.  It did help me stay satisfied until my next meal."
Fantastic blend,"This is a great tea packed with caffeine and complex flavors. It even works well iced! It's a great example of how some black teas can be re-steeped as many as 6 times before losing their flavor. Whenever I have guests, this is the first tea I offer them."
Good quality and worth the price.,"Tofu burger is a yummy tasting way to add something extra to the tofu.  It adds flavor and texture to your tofu, which is quite pleasing to the palet.  The product easily mixes into the tofu.  Even using this product, I still add a little extra dried onion and garlic, or all spice.  However, I perfer things on the hot and spicey side."
bddtacm,"I love the Senseo Coffee, dark roast especially.  My son introduced this coffee to me years ago and I have worn out two Senseo coffee pots.  When I had lung cancer, I heard that coffee was a good thing.  And I have my pot going almost all the time, loving the dark roast flavor the best.  I carried it with me when I flew to Texas and when the water holder was damaged, my daughter in Texas bought me a new Senseo pot.  When the handle on the top was broken, my son bought me another pot and for Christmas we bought a Senseo pot for another son who loves the French Vanilla. We love ordering from Amazon, as we cannot find the product locally."
Tasty & Crunchy,"Upon first opening the box, I noticed it has a peanut butter like smell. It reminded me faintly of Crackerjacks. The cereal is crunchy and lightly sweet. Depending on your opinion on sugar, you could find this too sweet or not sweet enough. The airy consistency reminded me of Kellogg's Pops. I liked that they remained crunchy from start to finish.<br /><br />I would say that it needs more nuts to carry off the ""Crunchy Nut"" name. There are probably the flakes of like ten peanuts in this entire box. It doesn't taste very nutty at all. I think the airy consistency would have been nicely complimented by the solid crunch of whole nuts.<br /><br />The cereal has a 100 calories, 10 g of sugar, 1 g of fat, and 11 g of carbs. It has no more than 25 percent of any vitamins or nutrients. The taste is obviously the best feature. It's pretty good. By the time I finish the box, I might like it better. I would buy it if it were on sale at my local supermarket."
"Strong Coffee, Good Taste",Unlike other K-Cups I was pleasantly surprised by the strong and good taste of this K-Cup. Definitely recommended for those looking for a stronger brew.
WARNING-NO RETURNS ACCEPTED,I have been told by my veternarian that Glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so I wanted to return 3 unopened packages (of 3 each)and the company will not accept returns.  Ridiculous.  They must know how bad they are for animals.
Love At First Bite!,My family loves them.  Two Yorkies and a Chihuahua are enjoying the Stix for the first time today.<br />I snapped them in half because they are long enough for two servings and I don't want my wee ones to get pudgy.<br />They are very similar in size and texture to Thinkers Duck Treats.  But I wish they had the vitamins and DHA for brain function like Thinkers.<br />I will buy these again for the wee ones.
"A good, strong tea.","Tea:  I like it, I drink it a lot.  But, I don't know all the much about it.  I'm not a tea connoisseur:  I don't make test the water temperature, I don't brew for a certain number of minutes, and I tend to let the tea bags sit around in the pot.  Still, I imagine most people are like me, so that's alright.<br /><br />As it is, this tea is great.  It was recommended to me by my girlfriend, and it was definitely a good recommendation.  It is by far what I have been drinking the most for the past while.  Obviously, I prefer not to drink it black.  Cream and sugar for sure.  But, it's good, and my favourite for the moment.  I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good black tea.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I don't feel like I know enough about tea."
Great food for 9 month old,My daughter loves Earth Best jar food. She is very picky about the taste so their varity comes in very handy.
Margaret Frank,"As a 64 year old grandma who takes care of three little boys while mother works I need energy and cannot always prepare a healthy meal that both the children and I will eat. They tend to like pizza etc. These protein bars give me the energy and have 20 grams of protein that I need, I am a vegetarian.  I find that they also cure my chocolate craving and are good enough for me to consider them my mid afternoon treat. With three children I often do not have time to eat. I would highly recommend them to any person who needs to eat on the run. I have them on auto ship as with a 9 month old, I cannot always get to a store that carries them.  The price is very competitive if ordering from Amazon. Believe me, I have checked."
yum ... a nice treat for the holidays,"I LOVE coffee but it needs to be strong with flavor so I decided to be a rebel and use this product in a different sort of way. I put 1 heaping TBS of Peppermint Mocha in a coffee cup and brewed 2 shots of espresso right into it, then added warm milk and topped it with whipped cream. The flavor came through in just the right amount.. only downside is the additional 150 calories so this will be a seasonal treat only."
Best stuff on earth,"My wife and I use this every night before we go to bed.  It is just as natural to us as breathing...we can really tell a difference in our health without it!!  I would advise anyone over 35 years old to use this stuff!! Our last order was for 5 16 oz., Rasberry Lime and that order was placed on September 19, 2011...I'm back at Amazon to buy another 5 containers!!  BTW...If you purchase this at your local health food store or vitamin store prepare to pay BIG TIME for this...We had a chiropractor try and sale us a 16 oz., bottle for $43.00!  Amazon, is the best deal on the web!!!"
price jumps be warned,I purchased this item on subscription for less than $10 and<br />was rudely shocked this month went it went up to<br />$16. I'm cancelling. This is ridiculous. Cheaper in the store.
Absolutely Delicious,"I have tried lots of BBQ sauces, including homemade, and believe Chris' & Pitt's BBQ Sauces to be the BEST you can make or buy."
Perfect coffee,"Eight O Clock coffee is fantastic, and the price is so much better than similar coffee. Especially for whole bean. I'm going to try the French Roast this time. Their hazelnut is great too."
great toddler snack,"I have been buying these for about a year now for my 2 boys now 2 and 4yo.  These are a great on the go snack that a mom can feel good about serving up.  It is neat and resealable.  My younger son started on these earlier and will eat any version of the pouches.  The older son is a little more picky and wants only the fruity version.  I just wish my local grocery store would carry but I can usual find a great selection at babys/toys-r-us, [...] and amazon. This site is great and I am a happy consumer but....amazons price is higher than most on this product."
No Salt? No problem!!,This is a very very good product. I have been trying to wean myself from salt and this does the trick. My foods (esp meats)are tasty and satisfying without the sodium risk
Good coffee!,"This is good coffee, robust and hearty especially for a decaf product.  Not bitter at all.  Good value too.  I can't find this brand in the local grocery stores and my husband loves it so I'm very happy to be able to find it on Amazon."
Not a huge fan of the ingrediants but my dog loves them,"My 11 year old dog loves greenies!  It's the best treat besides the smoked salmon he regularly gets.  The smell weird and the ingrediants are not that clean, but he's a fairly picky dog."
Great herbal tea,If you don't have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it's wonderful flavor here's an alternative.  This tea is refreshing.  True ginger flavor and punch is wonderful.
Awesome coconut oil,Great product. We have one in the kitchen for cooking and one on the baby's changing table for diaper rashes!
Dry and Not as Appealing as other treats,"I love the idea of this dog treat, that it cleans teeth and freshens breath.  However, to get the maximum effect of that, the box suggests feeding him two bones a day every day for the cleanest teeth.  I normally don't treat my dog that often, because I don't think it's that good for him and also the cost of treats.  I'd have to buy a box a week to keep up with that!  But as to the taste of it, my dog was very unappealed by it.  He still ate them, as he is a dog afterall, but he would put it down and come back to it and work on it almost in the way he does actual dry bones.  I just think it lacks the taste and therefore his interest.  He much prefers tastier treats as he gobbles them up or spends his time gnawing on his bones. But I still give 3 stars as it does seem to help his teeth and breath!  Now if they could just make it more appetizing.  My guy is not, by far, a picky eater, so if he's pickin' there's a problem!"
An Excellent Organic Honey from a Producer who Cares,"My order was turned over to USPS Priority Mail for delivery to me and, unfortunately, was apparently lost in mail-handling.  I was initially upset with the delay in receiving the product but, when the vendor was appraised of the contretemps, I was notified that a replacement shipment had be sent which I could expect to receive within two days.<br />The replacment shipment arrived promptly and I was pleased with the quality of the honey and its convenient packaging.  I cannot hold the vendor responsible for the mis-handling by the United States Postal Service and as far as the product itself, it was as good, or better, than any honey I have ever purchased anywhere, including honey purchased in the comb.  I unhesitatingly recommend YS Organic Bee Farms Clover Honey to anyone interested in an excellent organic product.  I will order it again."
Equal,Some brick and mortar stores have stopped carrying this but the price was good and shipping quick
Considered a staple item in our pantry!,"My husband and I have enjoyed International Coffee French Vanilla Cafe for years.  For a number of reasons, it's important that we have caffeine and sugar free products and this is one that we simply can't do without!  Along with it's companion, Sugar Free, Caffeine free Mocha, this is our substitute for hot cocoa in the evening or for a pick-me-up mid-afternoon in our office."
It sure is cat food.,"I think it would be more appropriate for my cat to be reviewing this product. But since he's busy with creative endeavors, I suppose my opinion will have to do.<br /><br />It's cat food. The cat eats it. It doesn't make him puke nearly as often as some foods with artificial colorings in them. When his dish is empty, he seems to request more of it.<br /><br />The quantity here will last about 2 months, give or take a week, used at the average rate of 2 handfulls per day."
This is the best!,"The Bob"" red mill bread baking mix is the best for gluten, wheat and dairy free diets. We use it all the time. We have made rolls and cinnamon bread out of it also. Very tasty and easy to follow instructions."
A Nice Combination,"When it comes to a body wash, I want something that's going to leave me clean and smelling better than I did when I took a shower.  But I don't want it to be so overpowering that other people flee the room when I enter.  I also want something that's on the masculine side of things and isn't overly floral.<br /><br />Enter the Dove Care for Men series.  I figured I'd give it a try and see how it works.<br /><br />So far, it's pretty good.  I swim laps a couple of times a week in a heavily chlorinated indoor pool.  So my first expectation is that the body wash would help remove that feeling of dryness and general chlorine-ness that can sometimes occur.  And it did that.<br /><br />The good thing is the dispenser on the top is large enough to get out enough but not so big that you're getting a ton more of the body wash then you need.  It allows for a greater degree of control and to use as little or as much as you need.  (I tend to err on the side of starting out with too little and getting more as needed rather than having too much).<br /><br />As for the scent, it's fairly subdued and not overpowering.<br /><br />A nice combination."
Kitty love,"My kitty loves these.  He knows where I keep them and he is so funny, when  he wants some he get on top of the basket and begins batting the bags."
perfect first finger food,"We used this as a first finger food with our twins and broke them into even smaller pieces.  Our babies had lots of teeth by 8 months, so they were able to chew.  The puffs melt down when sucked on, so it's a great first ""real food"" for the little ones.  The sweet potato is not ""too sweet"" as most of the other flavors are.  Even my older kids (ages 5 and 7) like to snack on these.  I never go anywhere in the car without them.  The star shape seems to be easier for the babies to get to their own mouths when just learning to self feed."
Not a good flavor. Tasted like chemicals.,"I was poorly surprised at how bad these taste. The after taste was horrible. This is just my opinion.<br /><br />Gave them to workers and they ate them up. To each his own, I guess."
"Very tasty, but with some problems.","As a very fussy packaged product eater, this is the only canned clam chowder I will buy.  It has the best flavor of any canned clam chowder I have ever tried, but it isn't without its flaws.<br /><br />The main problem I have is that almost every can has at least a few pieces of clam that are sandy.  It is extremely unpleasant to bite down on one of these, and it makes my jaw tingle for several minutes every time.  As much as I enjoy the flavor, I can deal with this, but some people may not.<br /><br />Also, there is a rotten (or at least black for some reason) piece of potato in about 1 out of every 4 cans.  I have to watch out for this as I eat it.<br /><br />It's also a little thicker than I would like it to be, so I often thin it out slightly with milk.<br /><br />I like to sprinkle some crumbled bacon and green onions over this to jazz it up.  That helps make it taste a little more like ""homemade"".<br /><br />You may wonder why I gave it four stars when I have to deal with sand and the occasional black potato chunk.  Well, it's simply because no other canned product I've tried even comes close.  I would easily give this 5 stars if the sand and potato issues were fixed with better quality control.  As it stands, I give this a 4 star rating simply because it's the best that I have found when compared to everything else I have tried."
The Best Supplement EVER!!!,"When I read one of the reviews that stated that this supplement changed their life, I was immediately excited because this supplement has changed my life as well!  I started taking this supplement as a part of my diet plan (Ideal Protein).  I took it to help me with bowel movements.  Lucky for me, not only did it improve my bowel movements, it fixed my insomnia problem.  I had insomnia and could not fall into deep sleep for years.  Within 2 weeks of taking this supplement, I was sleeping like a new born baby!  In addition, I became more relaxed and my anxiety completely disappeared!!  It did not stop there...my menstrual cycle is regular now and I no longer have muscle twitches.  TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE!<br /><br />I was soo excited about the improvement in the quality of my life, so I quickly spread the news to all my family and friends.  I worked like wonders for all of my family members.  The results from my friends was a mixed bag.  I think that for the people that have a true magnesium deficiency, this is a miracle supplement.  For those that may not have a true magnesium deficiency, this may not be the magic bullet for them.  I hope that this review was helpful.  I was compelled to spread the word about this supplement because it has truly changed my life!!!"
Great Waffle Mix,"The Golden Malted Waffle mix is very good. Light and fluffy on the inside, crisp on the outside. Only one problem....it is not made for a standard beligum waffle iron. Works best in the waffle irons that turn upside down once closed."
Best German coffee I've found on Amazon,"I started drinking German coffee a few months ago because I read that it was easier on those of us with acid reflux. This is definitely true - I've been able to cut my antacid use in half.<br /><br />I like my coffee strong, but not dark and bitter. After trying several brands of coffee here on Amazon, I've decided I like this one the best. It is strong and full-flavored with a normal amount of coffee in the percolator. Having beans to grind so it's really fresh is an added bonus. Subscribe and save makes it even better!"
A perfect way to start off a day,"Now I know why so many elders like pu-erh, it's really rich, warm, smooth and it's not caffeinated (i believe pu-erh is a type of fully fermented tea). This is a very high quality tea, will continue to buy."
Funky Monkey Junkie,I love this organic fruit mix.  It's delicious.  I only wish it came in very large bags.  It makes a delightful treat.  Highly suggest for children or adults.
Delicious tea!,"This Passion tea is used at Starbucks. We mix it with two Lipton tea bags for iced tea. Really good, fruity flavor. Great for summer!"
Energy,Nom Nom Nom....yum! I love this stuff.  I didn't buy the real Energy drink because the price was repugnant.  This stuff tastes better than that canned stuff! Nom Nom Nom.....  ;-)
It works for me,"I just got my result today and my cholesterol level dropped from 265 to 228 after taking this product for 2 months. I took 2 cews a day for 2 months. I also exercise 3-4 times a week and consume less fat.<br /><br />I will take 3 chews a day starting tomorrow and will have another test in the next 2-3 months. My target is to get my cholesterol level below 200, and I think I am in the right path to get there.<br /><br />I think that would be good also if Benecol can bring stanols in a capsule without the sugar."
Best brand out there...,"I have 7 dogs.  All various breeds and sizes.  I was looking for a brand without additives that all my dogs would benefit from.  I have a few that need to lose weight.  Wellness makes the best product.  I buy the small bites for my little ones....pieces are small and they love it.  I but the Healthy weightCORE for my ""dieters"" and mix it with canned green beans or peas and carrots.  So far my Golden, who was an overweight rescue at 129 pounds, has lost 19 pounds -- she's been on this food for about 7 months.  I buy the original CORE version for my baby bulldog, who had a lot of gas.  No more smells and ripples in the night!  Amazon has the best price for Wellness. And its shipped right to my home -- no lugging big bags back and forth.  Yes, it's more expensive than the other stuff--but it really works.  And that will cut down on future vet bills.  All my dogs are healthy and have nice shiny coats.  Priceless!  Wellness now has a SIMPLE version for those dogs who suffer with food allergies.  A family member has a little Teddy Bear with severe skin issues -- she'd scratch until raw and bloody.  She switched to the SIMPLE version of Wellness and has been itch free ever since.  Again...great brand!"
Nice Nice,"Tastes good, and only slightly sweet.<br />Problem is I keep eating it, and the crumbs make a mess everytime.<br />Seems a bit pricy too."
Get the Fog Chaser instead,"It's a decent coffee. The Fog Chaser from S.F. Bay Coffee is a better choice.  This is what people consider a ""bold"" blend.  That means it has harshness that hits you over the tongue like a hammer.  It's not smooth by any sense.  I usually enjoy my coffee black but this one is good with a flavored creamer to take the bitter edge off."
Sweeter than the other brand,"But not TOO sweet. Very enjoyable - I eat it right out of hand. ""Sun Maid Cape Cod Cranberries"" seems to have more ""Cranberry-ness"" to it than the other leading brand."
Soft and Chewy,"This individually wrapped cookie was moist, soft and chewy. The taste was perfect and it was beyond expectations, the perfect bite."
Just fantastic - a snack that feels like you ate something.,"KIND bars are really the best of all the snack bars I've tried. They somehow manage to preserve the flavors and textures of the ingredients and still hold it together in a bar that's not overly sweet or salty. They do cost a little more than typical grocery store brands, so I watch for the occasional good sales and stock up. I find they have a pretty decent shelf life. With some of the other brands, I feel like there's often more filler and mystery ingredients than good stuff. With KIND, the fruit and nuts really take center stage. I haven't tried the ones with chocolate or yogurt."
The Yummy Bubbly Juice,"The logo on The Switch says 100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't. The ingredients reads 100% juice (filtered) sparking water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates Grape, Apple, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon juice concentrates, natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) I'm on a health kick and I don't like to eat HFCS or corn syrup. I sometimes look at ""natural"" pop and am surprised to see corn syrup.  The taste of The Switch is outstanding, but I think it tastes more like grape/apple/strawberry than watermelon.  It has 140 calories in a dainty 8.3 fluid ounce can. If one is watching calories or carbs, I'm sure this would still taste good mixed with more soda water as it is a little sweet straight up.  I'll buy The Switch again."
McCann's Oatmeal,McCann's steel cut oatmeal is the best.  I seriously think I'm addicted to it.  It does take 30 minutes to cook but well worth it.  I make up a double batch that last about 5 mornings.
Good Quality,Good quality product.  I was having difficulty finding Hungarian Paprika in the local markets.  Amazon offered a wide variety of this product.  The multi-container offer was set at a good price.  I'm quite satisfied.  I would order it again.
LOVE THESE! Very crunchy and tasty. Great for toddlers.,"We just ordered the ""Very Berry"" and the ""Tropical Fruit"" arrived in the same box.<br /><br />Berry - Not crunchy at all. Almost tasted stale. Very broken up pieces.<br />Tropical - We loved! They were crunchy. This also had strawberries in it and they were crunchy. Also these fruit pieces were a nice size, didn't get pulverized in shipping."
Keeps my cats happy and healthy,"I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)"
Used for years - Camping - salads -fried w/eggs-Ham,This is the best on the market - RINSE very well then pan fry/dice for potato salad/ add to crockpot meals last 20/30 minutes to heat thru.
When you get tired of searching...,"Living in Florida near the water resulted in lots of shrimp in the freezer last fall. We enjoy our fried shrimp lightly coated, and this cracker meal is one of the best. Tried store after store then looked on line and ordered a case from Amazon delivered right to my door. Shared some with my mother and stored the extra boxes in the freezer. Save gas,Shop on line!"
0 Calories...0 Fat...0 Carbs...0 Sugar...Sweeeet!,"Torani's"" Sugar Free Vanilla Flavor Syrup"", is a nice way to add a little variety to your coffee, without having to run out to a Starbuck's for a sugar free Vanilla Latte.. As I mentioned in the title, there are no calories, fats, carbs or sugars. The taste is very sweet and vanillery, and you can use it in anything you want to add a little variety or flavor. I like it in my Pellegrino. Makes a nice Vanilla Soda. In my coffee, I found I did not have to add anything else. The syrup was good enough and tasty enough on it's own.I use it whenever, I get a sweet tooth, to get me past a craving for something with more calories involved.<br /><br />It is sweetened with ""Splenda"", and if you are not used to using Sugar substitutes, you may not like the little bit of an after taste it leaves.<br /><br />Ingrediants as listed are: Water, Vanilla Extract,other natural flavors, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Benzoate(there are 5 mg sodium listed on the label), Citric Acid,Xanthan Gum,Sucralose(the Splenda), Acesulfame Potassium.<br /><br />It's a bargain for the 750 ml, sold here.I paid almost as much for 375ml at my local grocery store. You'll probably use about two tablespoons per drink.(more or less) You'll get your money's worth. Add it to anything you want, hot chocolate, iced tea, etc. Maybe with the holiday's coming, it would be a nice change in other beverages as well. It is also sold with sugar added,and there are several other flavors with or without sugar, just click on other products by Torani at top of page. .<br /><br />Cheers....Laurie"
"Jell-O Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Coconut","This coconut pudding is a favorite in my family. I cannot find it in any of my local stores, I thought they had discontinued this flavor. I was thrilled to find it in the Amazon grocery store. This pudding is the best!"
Almost expired!,"I figured I would order in bulk this time, so I ordered three packages of this item, Dark Magic K-Cups. I love the Dark Magic coffee, but it is almost expired! It arrived on 1/12/2012 and it expires on 4/1/2012. I like fresh coffee, not almost expired. This is very disappointing. I will definitely reconsider before ordering coffee from Amazon ever again."
Really on the Go.,This is very delicious and really on the go.  I drink on my way to work in the morning.
Love it!,"My dog loves this food, and our vet and trainer both highly recommended it.  His coat is shiny and healthy and I like the fact that it is grain-free, which is good for dogs with allergies.  Great stuff, and at Amazon's price, very comparable to pet or grocery store prices, for a much better food."
Missing peanuts!,Many pieces have no peanuts. This peanut brittle is more hard candy than peanuts. Corn syrup is first ingredient. Try Ferdies.
My Cat Loves It!,"I'm a Bzz Agent and was lucky enough to receive a free bag of this cat food. I wasn't too sure if my cat would eat it or not because she is very picky and she has a very sensitive tummy. Well, she loved it and it didn't upset her stomach at all. In fact, she's more playful and just seems to be more healthier and active. I love  this food because it's designed to meet the nutritional needs of an older cat and that's something important to me. I will be buying this food from now on."
I love it!,"There's a reason why this noodle soup won the Chefs Best Awards, because it's just good, perfect flavor, perfect noodles and perfect amount of spiciness.<br /><br />Instructions are easy, you know the drill, add water and microwave, it doesn't get any easier than that.<br /><br />bottom line is, I love these noodles and highly recommend them."
Love this product and convenient.,"I subscribe this product so I don't have to go out and buy bunch.  If you love the product and don't mind eat this often, I highly recommend its subscription.  I love the taste - not too sweet, and the fact this stays crunchy longer than other cereals I had eaten."
AMAZING!,"These are the best chips ever!!!...except for the smoke flavor that is added to them, everything else seems healthy and natural...they are really Amazing!"
Muesli review,"This is a fantastic product, nothing bad about it, excellent product, incredible price when you get the subscription."
this will convert non tea drinkers!,"i love iced tea but i was never into hot tea. upon getting a sample tea bag of this particular flavor from a friend - i fell in love. shortly after i bought my own box. this stuff is DIVINE. its great on its own but if you add a little sweetner (i used Splenda) and some milk, the vanilla and caramel flavors are intensified which makes it all the more YUMMY. i am seriously addicted to this stuff."
Great coffee.  Better than Pikes.  Save the trip to the store.,Rich tasting.<br />In the afternoon my Starbucks Store only service Pikes.<br />I can have a richer coffee from home.
Juuuuust Right,"Just the right amount of oil, just the right amount of salt. When it comes to convenience, you will simply NOT be able to beat this Pack!"
My Dog Loves Them,"When I got these in the mail I wasn't sure if my dog Damon was going to like the Nutritious Diabetic Dog Cookies or not, but he absolutely fooled me!  I have cut back on his insulin from 15 cc's to 10!  I''m so excited to find out his sugar levels are toward the end of the month.  Thank you for making such a good tasting product."
A good mix of nuts,"First things first, this is a good bar. Tasty, chewy, and easy to throw into a bag for on the go eating. It didn't taste too salty, nor did one of the nuts dominate the others.<br /><br />However, even with how good it tastes these are really high in calories and fat content. So, for those looking for a healthy snack steer clear of this.<br /><br />But, if you are looking for a nutty flavor bar that can take the place of a candy bar, this may be just what you are looking for."
Yummy!,This trail mix is great! It is the perfect mixture of salty and sweet. This is great for a snack and it sticks with you.
Great tea for pregnancy,I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. It's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it. It helps strengthen the uterus. I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well.
GREAT TASTE for low fat,These are the best low fat refried beans I have ever tasted...  I used the beans in my 7 layer dip.  I tailgate a lot and the package was easy to use.
Winter beverage,I appreciate being able to purchase this item by the case.  It is my favorite Winter beverage.
Squashed Fly Biscuits,"These are commonly called ""squashed-fly"" biscuits in the UK.  I have eaten the domestic and English varities, and I feel there is little to choose between them.  I am just happy enough to have Amazon provide them, in order for me to properly enjoy my Yorkshire tea."
"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!",These soy nuts are the perfect snack.  Just the right amount of sea salt and satisfying.  I also love that they are organic and not made from GMO soybeans.
Super Delish,"This Olive Oil I discovered at a farmers market in San Fransico, and ever since then,  it has been my most favorite. It tastes very olivey and fruity and doesn't have any weird smell or taste. in fact, this olive oil is delicious with just a piece of bread an nothing else. So of couse, using it on salads, bruchetta, anything you use olive oil for, this is the perfect one. I like that on the label it says when the olives were harvested and when it was bottled. I think that is a fancy touch."
Burn baby burn,"I bought this sauce primarily to bring to work and pass around to my coworkers and boy did we have fun with it.  I knew I couldn't handle the heat of this sauce as I find Habanero sauces are usually just a bit too hot for me but there were a couple of my coworkers that powered through the burn impressively.  The first thing a few of us did was the toothpick tip test and fingertip drop test.  I did the toothpick test and drew a line of the sauce across my tongue.  The heat wasn't immediate but I began salivating like mad.  The heat built into what felt like a paper cut across my tongue, way too hot for me.  Others who did small drops could feel exactly where the sauce was as it found it's way down their throats.  You definitely want to try this sauce in small amounts before taking on a full serving.<br /><br />Then there was George; he's used to hot foods and without even testing it, put a river down the length of his pizza slice.  Those who tasted it gathered around to see the show.  He did remarkably well and said it was good, he did end up with puffy eyes and was coughing but he came out of the whole thing looking pretty well considering the amount he used.  I asked him the next day ""how'd that feel later on George?"" and he just grinned.<br /><br />Then there was Enrique, he did the toothpick test and proclaimed it ""muy bien"" and ended up taking it with him to eat his lunch and it came back less full and he looked no worse for the wear.  I do know that it made him cough though when he first tried it but I suspect Enrique eats Habanero peppers whole.<br /><br />Bottom line, this sauce is likely far too hot for most people but it sure is an adventure even in tiny doses.  It made a fun day in the office and a couple of guys actually enjoyed the flavor and the sauce with their food.  I can't personally tell you how good the flavor is because I just can't handle it; but those that truly tried it said it was pretty good.<br /><br />5 stars for performance and fun."
Please give full info easily with easy access,"I was looking at this but realized I couldn't seem to find a size except ""extra large"".  May I suggest that you tell us what ""extra large"" is?  And...how about list it clearly and front and center?"
I finally found this!,"I love making spaghetti sauce by adding Spatini to plain tomato sauce. I was so upset when the grocery stores in my area stopped carrying it.  I was excited to find this on Amazon. Although it's a little difficult because it comes in such a large packet, I was able to put just the right amount of seasoning in to make a wonderfully zesty sauce!  I love this product!  I love Amazon.com!"
Delicious,Wonderful dark chocolate not sure which was my favorite but they all get 5 stars!! Would definitely get again and again! Any chocolate lover would enjoy them!
Finicky puppy,After trying a lot of different types of food for my puppie (havanese) she has settled on the dried brief Stella and chewy. I just grind it and put some hot water in there and she gulps it all up.
Finnaly found it!,None of the super markets carry this product so I stopped looking.  Then it occured to me that Amazon might have it.  I was amazed<br />and thrilled that  they carried it.  It's a six pack so I don't have to reorder every time a bottle gets low.  Thanks Amazon!
mislead,Product is wonderful. Been using agave nectar for about 3 years. It is better than refined sugar. Only received 6 of 12 ordered. Promised refund but have not recieved it yet.
Warning: Contains Menadione,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."
Half and Half,"Each sip starts with a sharp citrus-y note from the lemon balm and lemongrass, followed by clear, strong Sencha, and rounded out with an earthy, herbal note from the verbena.  The tea has a crisp, refreshing flavor and is good hot or cold.  Both the lemon flavor and the tea are apparent on the palate.  Neither is dominant; they are equal.<br /><br />The tea is strong.  I brewed for two minutes at 180 degrees.  The color is a deep yellow, or more exactly, a pale amber.  The lemon herbs do overpower the Sencha's ""seaweed"" fragrance and taste, but the tea's brightness and sweetness are not diminished.<br /><br />I prefer less adulteration to tea's innate flavor and fragrance.  However, among flavored teas, I do think this is excellent.  There are no ""natural"" flavorings.  Each ingredient speaks for itself, and there is no off-flavor.<br /><br />Served hot with a bit of honey, this would soothe one's throat nicely."
Put  Wicks in Them,"I recently ordered some of Meiji's limited-edition chocolate bars online and it occurred to me that perhaps Amazon carried them for less (they don't, at all). My quest led me to this product which not only looked interesting but had garnered reviewer raves as well. Today's errands took me past a Japanese grocery, so I made it a point to have a look for it (it's apparently a popular impulse purchase because it was displayed next to the cash register).<br />Given the positive reviews, I had high hopes. And if appearance is high on your list of priorities, then this is definitely your kind of snack because one thing the Japanese have nailed, in spades, is a visual aesthetic and these things are adorable, plus mine came packaged in a really snappy cardboard tube. However, while good looks are the top priority when it comes to boyfriends, my criteria for food are much less shallow and Apollo falls short of the mark.<br />I think the basis of the problem is that the Japanese, who produce a number of slammin' items (remember that aesthetic), have so far proved themselves incapable of mastering chocolate. I have yet to sample Japanese chocolate that isn't both waxy and short on the essence of chocolate flavor. This item is no exception, plus I don't find the strawberry flavor all that vivid (although to Meiji's credit, it's natural). And it really is easy to finish the container, but I believe that's due more to the fact that Apollo is sweet and innocuous, not that it's delicious. Perhaps if cocoa butter rather than vegetable oil had been the second ingredient listed, Apollo would suggest chocolate rather than paraffin, but who can say for sure? What is sure is that I won't be buying it again.<br />The bottom line: empty calories can be had more deliciously; save your quota for a more worthy goodie. I have no doubt that this review will earn me slams from fan boys (in addition to those guaranteed to turn up immediately, courtesy of obsessive liver-lipped Finnish ugly-boy troll stalkers), but I have to call 'em as I see 'em. 3.5 stars would be about right, but we can't assign by halves so 3 it is."
Good stuff,"I bought this for my wife. She loves strawberry tootsie rolls and she was very pleased with these. I'm less of an enthusiast, but even I can appreciate tasty flavored candy. My only complaint is that I can't seem to find these things locally in our grocery store. The cost of shipping was about as much as the price of the product itself."
Yummy in my tummy,The price is great with the subscription and it tastes great with vanilla soy milk. But the sugar content is a little higher that I'd like. I'd rather have Kashi Heart to Heart. It tastes very similiar if not better with lower sugar.
Not a toy. Energy drink/collectable,"Well to start I don't know why this is under toys when it's a drink.  The bottle is pretty and coll looking but the smell and taste is terrible. Also the horrible taste will stay in your mouth for quite a while. I don't recommend this is you intend to drink it. But I resealed mine and put in on a shelf with the rest of my collectors stuff. Same thing goes for the mana drink, very pretty and cool but the grossest thing you can imagine."
Campbell's,"Priced real well when I purchased. The only reason, I bought it was for the price. We all already know what the product taste like. Delicious.<br /><br />If you can catch it less than 40 bucks and you like Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, just press the purchase button."
"A ""Must Have"" for our dogs","Our dogs need to chew.  We feel comfortable with this product because there are no little pieces breaking off as possible chocking or digestive hazards. The dogs love it and could work on it for hours, but we set a time limit and save the treat for another day.  That way it lasts for quite awhile.  We prefer the ones that are wheat free. Most dog treats contain wheat which our dogs can't have so that's another plus. The biggest problem is fitting the treat into the ball, but if that were easy it would also be easy for the dogs to get it out! This product is safe and fun."
Awesome tea,"I have been drinking these teas for a long time,they are so good and good for you,auto ship is great."
Nothing Special,"To be fair, I'm not a fan of boxed Macaroni and Cheese, I'd rather make it with the real stuff! But I was curious how veggie pasta would taste. I cant say this tasted any better than regular boxed mac and cheese. Didnt care for it."
Great alternative to extinct Emerald Green Relish,"If you have been searching in vain for B&G's Emerald Green Relish, which no longer is made, this is a more expensive yet excellent alternative. Crunchy, crisp, clean taste that has always added zip to tuna salad as well as great on hot dogs."
Great product / Made in the USA,This product is great.  I am in Iraq and like that we can mail this without having it melt like ofther sweats.  This product is hard to find in stores but I alway get them for myself and a box for my Uncle for christmas.
YUMMY,My husband is very picky when it come to flavored coffee.  He found that this was just PERFECT.. Not too strong or weak on Flavor
Fabulous Product,I love this product. It is nice to get to enjoy all the great parts about peanut butter with none of the bad nutritional elements. I like to enjoy peanut butter but I don't want all the extra calories. Flavors are great.
coffee,the coffee is shipped in 4 boxes each pod is wrapped for freshness the cup of coffee tastes real good I do not add sugar or cream so I know its a good cup of coffee
Breakfast Cookie,"Soft, filling...someone forgot the Bananas...will not repurchase. Each person will have to judge for themselves but cannot recommend."
I CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE,I've suffered from acid reflux and have postprandial hypotension.  I drink Evamore because of it's ph level. Evamore tastes great - I crave this water and can easily drink 32 oz. Drinking any other water I feel bloated and full after 8 oz. Not with Evamore. I physically felt better after drinking it. Don' have to make as many pit-stops with Evamore - seems like my body is absorbing more of it instead of just flushing it like other water. I'm glad to drink Evamore & know there are no prescription medicines in it. Go to Evamore website for good info on them. I order it from my health food store by the case & they give me a 10% discount.
Great Taste!!,I bought these in Maryland and was addicted!!! I cannot find them in SW Georgia and was lucky enough to find them on Amazon :)<br />My FAVORITE snack!!
"Mild, not wild, about GMC French Vanilla","Green Mountain Coffee's French Vanilla has a nice taste, one that is not synthetic and the vanilla tones are subtle.  I would prefer a slightly more robust coffee roast and/or a stronger sense of the vanilla.  It is a good medium blend and certainly shouldn't offend."
Good quick meal,"The three ounce breakfast cookies are a small meal in a cookie and the individually wrapped cookies are easy to keep in a desk drawer, or to carry in a back pack or briefcase.  They are good for people on the go, and have reasonably balanced nutrition (6 grams of protein, 6 grams of fiber, 8 grams of fat).  They are listed as having 300 calories.  They have an expiration date noted on the wrapper.  I have tried many different flavors over many years, and have never found a flavor I did not like.  The listing of ingredients is in white lettering on an orange background on the wrapper,and is almost impossible to read, but the ingredients can be obtained from the Web page.  The Morning Glory cookies have a good combination.  It is worth sampling the different cookie flavors, and you will undoubtedly have favorites."
it's organic,"I give it credit for being organic but the flavor is off. I got the strawberry and I don't think it tastes like strawberry at all, maybe it's just me but I found that I don't really care for the flavor. The ingredients say everything is organic but it is made from apples and not straberries. It says it has organic flavoring but does not state what the flavoring is from. I don't think I would buy this again only because I didn't like the taste."
My personal favorite,"I was tired of the standard bag of chips and could never finish a full bag. These Kettle brand chips are really good, crisp and the pepper adds great flavor to them.<br /><br />These chips are right up there with PopChips as two of the better brands one can get."
Delicato Espresso,"This is a good product.  It is what the name implies, delicate.  Smooth and satisfying but if you want a more robust espresso try the Intenso.  It is my favorite.<br /><br />Now if I can just keep the machine up and running.  For the past three years it's been sent back to a company in the midwest three times where I bought it and who services the machine.  The last time they returned the machine the clock was broken and they refused to do anything about it.  Needless to say I buy all my coffee from Amazon and NOT this company.  The machine works fine, sans the clock.  If anyone knows who I can send the machine for service should I need it, please let me know.  I wished Amazon did that too!"
Pellet gun would be a better option.,"I purchased this as it said that it would help repel squirrels. After applying it all over the tree branches/fruit that hang over the patio that these pest sit, eat, drop fruit, defecate and urinate over (making our patio most undesirable to be around)it had absolutely no effect on repelling them. So unfortunately this item is totally useless on repelling the squirrels in our neighborhood = 1 star because there is a zero star option."
Great tea,"I really enjoy this tea and have tried a lot of different green teas, especially the genmaicha.  This tea has a robust toasted flavor and I have not found a better tea to replace it.  I would like to find a tea with less packaging to minimize waste...."
"Watery, sugary flavor.  Disappointing",I was very excited to try this product but what a disappointment!.  Very  weak watery coffee flavor. And also much too sweet. Wouldn't buy this product again.
A Happy Dog is a Green Dog,"My wife and I share our home with the Three Muske-Terriers: A male Westie, a male Cesky and, the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty. The Empress is alergic to wheat, (along with corn and soy), so I had my doubts concerning Pet Greens Roasted Chicken Recipe w/ Wheat Grass Dog Treats - wheat grass after all is just ""juvenile"" wheat. But apparently not to worry! We're half way through our first bag and no allergic reaction, (you haven't lived until you've seen a crazed Scotty in the middle of an allergic frenzy chewing on her tootsies). Now, putting aside her allergies, the Empress will eat almost anything - and so will the Cesky. But the Westie gives new meaning to the term ""finicky"" - and Asta gives these treats five barks - I mean, stars. So what's up here?<br /><br />The treats are mostly roasted chicken meal, supplemented with dried chicory extract, organic ground wheat grass powder, lecithin, salt, cultured whey and garlic, preserved with ""mixed tocopherols,"" (I'm not a chemist, but I think that's a fancy name for vitamin E, sourced from vegetable oil). The wheat grass doesn't contain any wheat glutten - which I think is the reason it doesn't trigger the Empress' allergies. Wheat grass is an excellent source of any and all of the nutrients contained in fresh vegetables.<br /><br />The treats are small ""jerky-like"" rectangles - no more than an inch by 3/4s of an inch, and maybe 1/16 of an inch thick, (they may be more appropriate for small to medium size dogs - a large dog would want three or four at a time). They're great for a quick reward and at only about 4 calories a piece, there's not much danger that your dog is going to put on unwanted pounds, (however I wouldn't suggest that you carry them loose in your pocket or purse - they smell strongly of garlic - I keep 'em in a zip lock baggie).<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the ingrediants are all natural, but only the wheat grass is organic - if you are interested in organic treats, I suggest that you check out those made by Wagatha or Robbie Dawg.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I think that Pet Greens offers both a change of flavor and a change in texture from most common dog treats. The Three Muske-Terriers are scarfing 'em down - your furry buddy probably will too."
Very poor Quality,"I was very excited to get some more Silver Needle Tea.  Their price was competitive but no cheap by any means.<br /><br />First complaint was the packaging the tea was packed in plastic bag and shipped with the second outer plastic bag.  Silver needle tea have beautiful fuzzy little delicate buds that should be handled with care, this was not the case.  However their handling was just a preview to the lack of quality, this tea company sells.<br />Review of the Tea.<br />Aroma: The aroma was weak when compared to other Silver needle tea I've had.<br />Appearance: there was lots of impurities. I will post a picture if I can figure out how. There were pieces of stems beyond the bud.  Piece of leaves of the were clearly not baby buds but of mature leaves.  Lots of brown colors there were pieces of leaves that were clearly not beautiful fuzzy little friends.  The buds that were there were more yellow than the delicate green.<br /><br />brew:  there was lots of debris/particulate in the first few brews.  the brew lacked delicate aroma and its color was off darker than I'm used to.  the flavor was more earthy than delicate reminding me of a strong cheap green tea. this tea also lacked exquisite sweat flavors/aromas that I so love about silver needle teas.<br /><br />on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this tea and 1.5 or 2.  For comparison I would rate my last batch of Rishi Organic Silver needle tea an 8.5.<br /><br />I am now stuck with 8 ounces of this very disappointing.  If you are a connoisseur of this absolutely wonderful type of tea save yourself disappointment and look elsewhere."
Do It Yourself Energy Mix,"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Fruit Punch is a tasty and economical alternative to canned energy drinks. The punch flavor is good and can be adjusted to taste by using more or less of the product in your water, but increasing the flavor also means increasing the amount of caffeine in the drink. The vitamins and caffeine provide and nice boost without  causing the shakes or the crash that often follows. I look forward to trying other flavors."
Too many carbs,"It tastes OK, but it has too many carbs. I am on a low carb diet and I gained four pounds after I started drinking this (nothing else in my diet changed). They came off when I quit."
Doesn't taste like anything,"I bought this product based on the reviews. I usually drink Twinnings Spiced Chai but I wanted to try something that was more convenient than hot tea. I got it in the mail today and tried it as an ""iced tea,"" not good at all. It didn't mix well and mostly tasted like milky water. So I added a little more with little difference. It's a couple hours later and I'm drinking the hot version as I'm writing this review and I still don't like it. Plus the smell isn't very appealing to me. I had to use 6 tablespoons in order to taste the flavor. I don't know about the other reviewers, but I personally won't be buying this again. Big Train can pull out the station, I'm taking the bus!"
is there such a thing as overcooked peanuts,"These peanuts are rock hard.  I ate a handful of peanuts and got a bad stomach ache.  They don't taste bad, and not salty at all. I don't understand why they are so hard.  Ouch.  I love the peanuts from Costco.  They are also extra large and delicious but they never hurt my stomach.  Must go back to them."
great wheat-free cookies!,"These oatmeal animal crackers are very good!! My kids like them alright, but I love them! They are a really good, wholesome, filling snack in the middle of the day or even at bedtime! This is the best low-fat, wheat-free cookie I've ever tried!"
"Fine quality, great price.",We have no complaint about these. We get the 5 lb bag and keep it in the freezer taking out what we need every so often to another container and then resealing. The quality has been consistently good as a subscribe and save item for us. Highly recommend.
"Great Product, Great Price","<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC"">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />I absolutely love this sugar free syrup. The consistency is more like water but it is full of flavor and you don't need to add a ton of syrup to get the sweetness. I use this with my morning cold brew coffee and diet soda and it adds a little extra to the drink. Great for diabetics to get a little extra sweetness!"
"Yummy, indulgent tasting cookie",These are really great tasting cookies. I like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate. A nice change from the usual chocolate chip cookies.
disappointing,"I discovered Bariani at my CSA during the 90s and remember it as a superior and tasty product.  So I ordered a case (6 bottles) of 33.6 oz Bariani this fall 2010 and boy, was I disappointed!!!  This oil has a BITTER finish.  Sore throat bitter! I dont remember it being like this--this bitterness is memorable!  Has the production changed?  Does the oil get damaged by heat in a warehouse situation?  First impression is pleasant but the flavor is soon replaced by an extreme bitterness.<br /><br />I'll use the Bariani for cooking and hope that Im not poisoning myself."
Can't get enough Metromint water!,"I've been a fan of Metromint since I first tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NNEYUC"">Hint Essence Water Variety Pack, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>it, in 2007.  GOOD STUFF!  And such a variety of flavors:  peppermint, spearment, cherrymint, orangemint, lemonmint, chocolate mint, goodberrymint...I think that's it.  Try 'em all!"
Stevia Extract,"I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable. By the pound, it is far cheaper than the 1 ounce bottles sold in stores. I cook for diabetic people and this eliminates the sugar problem. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I will buy again.<br />For those unfamiliar with the amount to use - use 1/2 teaspoon of extract instead of 1 cup of granulated sugar."
Sweet stuff!,"I was quite skeptical about stevia at first, but tried it with another brand and thought there wasn't much difference in taste and I felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there. I then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product. I now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased. The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors.<br /><br />The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging."
Snickerdoodle Cookies,"I have to say that I was not very impressed with the cookie mix. I'm not a baker, and I freely admit that I could have goofed in the preparation somewhere along the line, but it seemed to me that I was following the instructions to the letter and still ended up with these little half dollar size hockey pucks. The dough was in the same size as when I scooped it out to put on the baking pan, without expanding at all. They tasted okay, but I wouldn't say they were good. I still have some of the mix, and I will try again. If it's successful next time I'll come back and re-review the product, but as it stands now I wouldn't recommend the mix."
Yummy!,"Yummy!  Great ""everyday"" coffee.  Newman products in general are wonderful for you and the earth.  This k-cup and Jet Fuel k-cups are enough for me!"
Great product!,"This product ships fast so you don't spend a lot of time waiting to enjoy it.  And when it arrives, you are not disappointed.  It is sealed well and remains moist in it's own liquid.  The texture is smooth, silky and not too stiff.  This is a cheese you will truly enjoy."
Yummy,These organic energy bites are delicious and work great.  I use them for golf tournaments or long bike rides.  A few bites every half hour and you will have ample energy for hours of activity.
Cats love it!,"I have one finicky cat and one food-hog cat. Both of them like this food. First ingredient is chicken, good. Next few ingredients are also good, but this is not ""natural"" cat food and thus, includes preservatives and taste enhancers (that I generally avoid). Also, the packaging is cute, but excessive. You get a case of 24 cans, but within that case, are 6 smaller boxes that hold 4 cans each. None-the-less, the quality is superior to ""fancy feast"" or other bottom-rung cat foods. This food is a solid ""medium quality"". The food is what I call ""gravy"" style as opposed to ""loaf"" style, meaning you are paying for a decent amount of gravy in each can as opposed to meat and other real food. To their credit though, the chicken is REAL white meat chicken, not processed chicken parts made to look like ""shredded chicken"". The cats love it and the packaging (though excessive) makes it convenient for storing little cans in your cupboard."
lollipops for a circus party,My son was turning one. We had a circus party and the suckers were great for decorations and eating. I put a number one sticker on each one of the suckers also.
Not what I expected.,"I purchased this product because I REALLY liked the Nesquick ""Very Vanilla"". And of course they stopped making it; like they do everything else that I like. It came in a plastic, obling container. This one comes in a round canister. I figured that they would be very close to the same, if not exactly. They are the same brand after all. But I was wrong. This one isn't anything like the other. It is bright yellow to start with. Drinking neon yellow milk is not too appetizing. The taste was completely different. too. I'm not sure how to explain the taste of this one. Except yuck. Ya it is vanilla, tho. But there is some  kind of weird after taste. If you are going to be purchasing this for a child, especially if it is to try to get them to drink their milk, I  would reccomend it. A child wouldn't be bothered by the yellow color. They might even think it's cool. But if you are like me and are trying to replace the ""very vanilla"" that Nesquik recently discontinued. DON'T. I wish I hadn't. I even purchased an entire case! Big mistake. Oh Ya. One more thing. The writing on the can is mostly Spanish. There is some English but it is not the main language. It is like under the Spanish-just incase we need it. You know how they do with the merchandise here (in the USA); they have a small Spanish translation under the English word. It is the same on this, but reversed. Spanish is the main language. The directions are even in Spanish.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you:)"
she loves it!,my 1 yr pom loves rawhides so this is perfect!! shes been working at it for a few days!! i am buys A LOT more of these to keep her sane in her cage until i get home from work!!
"Fresh, Huge, Tasty",Would buy these again. Great quality and freshness. Not too salty or oily and they are about as jumbo as you can get.
My favorite pretzels,I don't eat Gluten so I am always looking for good Gluten Free snacks. Most are  like sawdust -- These taste better than regular pretzels.  I highly recommend them.
Nice flavour,"I like this coffee, its nice to drink it in the morning. It has medium body and full flavour. Goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk."
"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
My dogs love them!,"I tried Zukes Minis after they were suggested by a vet tech as a great treat for training my new puppy.  They are soft and easy to cut into even smaller pieces so you can use a lot of them during training sessions.  The price through Amazon beats the pet and feed store prices by a long way, so I bought 3 large bags of different flavors.  The bags zip shut, so the treats stay fresh.  I just take out a handful and cut them in quarters, and keep them in another ZipLoc bag, enough for a few training sessions.  I cut them using both a pill cutter and a knife; I think using a knife is easier.  In their whole uncut size, they are only 4 calories each, so they are not a fattening treat either.  A great product I feel good about using."
Not as good as belly flops,"I bought 10 lbs of belly flops a while back and those were so good and very sweet.  These jelly beans or not as sweet nor tasty. There seems to be a lot more root beer beans than any other ones.  They did not come in bags just a box of jelly beans.  The value was very good for the money, but in the future I'm only going to stick to flops."
how many cans?,"Wow that is really expensive for one 13 ounce can of cat food.. duh<br />Can you please put how many cans are included<br />My cats both like Friskies, but I aint buying if I don't know how many I am getting"
Another great Bob's Red Mill product,"I have this item on automatic shipment receiving 3 boxes per month for our larger family. We all eat a GF/DF + diet. Because there are multiple food allergies in our family, grocery shopping can be a bit pricey. Amazon's prices allow us to buy the ingredients we need at a price that doesn't break the bank, and Bob's Red Mill provides the high quality products that provide consistent tasty results every time.<br /><br />This arrowroot flour is a must have in the gluten-free kitchen. We pair this with the Bob's Red Mill Garbanzo Bean flour, using equal amounts of each in our recipes, for fantastic results every. single. time.  My daughter professionally makes allergen free cakes and goodies, and this product, with the garbanzo bean flour, are her go to pairing for almost all of her treats. Everyone enjoys the end results - even those who do not follow a GF diet. That's the true test, and Bob's Red Mill ingredients pass the test every time."
"Soup is great, cans may come dented","Clearly I must love this soup as I got myself 12-packs of these things.  Twice.  And I live alone.  Or maybe that's why I bought so much soup?<br /><br />At least compared to local stores like Safeway, you can't beat the Amazon price for these soups.  Cheapest I saw the soup was $3.29 a can at my local Safeway, compared to $2.78 a can at time of writing this review (before the subscribe and save discount.)<br /><br />Flavour wise, the wild-rice adds a nice texture.  I much prefer it over potatoes.  The chicken is pretty decent too -- for processed meat in a can.<br /><br />The one problem you MIGHT encounter though is that about 30% of my soup cans came dented.  Amazon needs to figure out how to better package soup for transit.<br /><br />But then again, that's where the great customer service at Amazon comes in.  When I got a hold of support, they offered to refund my case or just send me a replacement case.  I opted for a replacement and just discarded the dented cans.<br /><br />So you can pretty much order this with confidence if you like this flavour in the first place, and if there's a problem, Amazon will fix it. :)"
Popchips,"I love these; a low calorie way to get that ""barbeque potato chip"" taste. Still somewhat high in sodium, but healthier than regular chips. You really do get that barbeque potato chip taste! If you are trying to eat healtier or lose weight this may satisfy your ""potato chip craving"".  I really like the barbeque flavor. Great single serving for portion control. (It's easy to eat too many chips without knowing it!)"
Pass It By!,"This stuff tastes horrible!  And that includes the cranberry pomegranate as well.  It tastes like Kool Aid with extra chemicals--really nasty.  I'm going back to Crystal Light, even knowing that the Sucralose in Totally Light is healthier than the aspartame in Crystal Light.  Somehow, Totally Light should get some clue from Crystal Light to come up with a better taste and ""mouth feel.""  Totally Light is just chemical and watery tasting."
shipped very quick,"no joke they shipped very fast, and are sooo yummy. I love frogs, and these do not disappoint, is truely a big bag of frogs lol."
Pleasant Joy in a mini Cup,"I bought this for a friend as a replacement for all the ones I drank using her one cup brewer. I drank them all, that's how delicious they were!"
Tea bags,I purchased four boxes of Tetley decaffeinated tea bags. The price was much lower<br />than ZI could purcase Lipton brand at the store. The quality of the tea is excelent.<br />I will purchase the product again.
"How can you not like Oreos, especially small packages","Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp."
eVERYBODY loved them!!,"Well , these were a hit!!!<br />From 2yrs. and up , all Graham cracker lovers  went crazy for these !!<br /><br />It was the rich but slight honey flavour that put them above the rest<br /><br />They were also just a bit more crisp as opposed to the usual 'mushy' feel of most Graham Crackers<br /><br />They had great taste, texture and price<br />Nice value"
"My cats love this brand of canned food, but....","My cats love this brand of food, especially the salmon and turkey flavors. However, they leave the peas and carrots behind. Which makes me feel like I'm not getting my money's worth! However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some."
kettle chips,"This kettle chips taste ""Good , Crispy & Crunchy "" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced!"
"Great Food, Worth the Money","I've been feeding my cat this food for the past year and she loves it. She hasn't gotten sick from it or shows any signs of being sick. A few weeks ago she got a clean bill of health from the vet, so I know there is nothing in this food that is potentially harmful. I really like this food, and the fact that is doesn't have any animal by-products is a plus. I would recommend Newman's Own Dry Cat Food."
Fussy Dog,My dog was not as crazy about this product as I thought she might be.  They are a healthy treat that she will eat after she knows she isn't getting anything else.
BROKEN GINGER SNAPS,"REALLY ENJOY THE 'SNAPPY GINGER' TASTE IN MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE GINGER SNAPS.<br />THIS CASE SEEMED TO ONLY HAVE ABOUT 5-8 WHOLE, IN TACT COOKIES IN EACH PACKAGE.  THEY WERE MOSTLY GINGER SNAP CRUMBS!<br />I HAVE ORDERED THESE GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES OFTEN AND THE MOSTLY CRUMBS WAS A FIRST.  I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH OTHER MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES I HAVE ORDERED IN THE PAST.<br />HAVEN'T DECIDED IF I WILL ORDER A CASE OF THEM AGAIN."
Maxine Loves them!,"My 9 year old llasa apso is so picky with her treats.  I buy many different kinds of treats and she just won't go near them so I have been donating them to the Humane Society up the street.  However, once I bought 1 bag of these sweet potato and chicken treats about 3 months ago while I was in Houston ,TX and brought them home and she just loved them! The price is great for 6 bags and free shipping.  I will be ordering from here for a long time.  Thanks again!!"
Inexpensive alternative to whole nuts,"We bought these because the whole/half Macadamia nut products from Mauna Loa were not available at that time from Amazon.  Adding a little sea salt, they taste just as good, and as a side benefit, the cost is a lot less.  But about the same per ounce as the 24 oz. whole Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macadamias with Sea Salt from Costco, when they have them in stock.)<br /><br />The Amazon ""Product Features"" say these are lightly salted, but that's not true, as you can see from the ""Nutritional Information"" the sodium content is 0 mg."
Perfect morning blend,"This is my husbands favorite morning coffee blend. Not too bold, just the perfect jumpp start to the day !"
Meh.,"Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking."
treats,My dogs love them.  They don't last very long with the larger dog. Will order more some time. Good price.
An excellent domestic balsamic,"This is a smooth, sweet balsamic that does not have the acidic bite of some balsamic vinegars. It is fluid and syrupy, not watery. It is so delicious, I often don't even use olive oil on my salad, although Stonehouse's Estate Blend Olive Oil is a delicious pairing. It also tastes excellent on vanilla ice cream."
Love this product,We already use two other pasta under the same brand and we can't stop recommending it to everyone even if it is just for health reasons.  It cooks wonderfully well and a little overlooking in terms of the recommended time does not turn the pasta to mush like other rice pasta.  Highly recommend.  Love it.
GOOD DEAL!,Got the 30lb bag on Amazon at $9 less than the local petstore. How excellent is that??? - Better price and good to have it delivered to my door!  My pup has been eating this premium dog food for years....it's got all the good stuff and none of the bad!
Tasty...,"I was wanting to try parched corn to see if I liked it, before thinking about trying to make my own.  Commercial parched corn seems VERY hard to come by, this was actually all I was able to find.  One might have more luck hitting up small local stores, maybe.<br /><br />At any rate, I did very much enjoy this product.  I was worried it would be very hard, but it isn't.  Has a very nice flavor.  I have to disagree with an earlier reviewer who complained that it dried his mouth out badly.  It's no worse than any other salty snack I've had in that regard.  Though I know it'd be more economical to make my own, I think the price is good enough that I'd buy again (considering shipping is included).  Especially given that my attempt at it will likely not be as good as this."
Timely,The Tea arrived ahead of schedule and the package was unharmed. The package contained a speical commentary gift tea bag for me try.
Refreshing and clean-tasting,"WOW I can really tell the difference between these and every other kind of mint. Clean-tasting means these don't coat my teeth with ick like some other candies do and the mint flavor is very crisp. Never going back to ick-mints after these. Glad I bought them.<br /><br />I've read the other reviews that compare them to Altoids ... I'm not going that far. These have a milder bite, that I actually prefer. I think Altoids go too far. I don't get that feeling in the back of my throat/sinuses that starts to make my eyes water.<br /><br />Size-wise these have a diameter between the size of a dime and a nickel. So, they could be a bit bigger. They look hand-made because each one is slightly unique ... nothing like those candies that are all exactly the same.<br /><br />The individual wrapping is very good so they're very easy to take-along."
Tasty,Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
Smokin!,"If you love almonds - especially Blue Diamond Almonds, these are great!  It is like Blue Diamond Almonds on steroids.  They are not incredibly spicy, but they have a little zip and a good amount of flavor.  A better buy than the Habanero BBQ ones for sure.  I would buy them again and they are great with a cold beer."
Items are very fresh. Important in a 10-Pack.,"These 10 packs of fiber plus boxes contain 60 bars. I was worried about a nearly approaching expiration date. But these are far better than the grocery stores! Purchased in February, Expires in September! That's 8 months of freshness for a 1 month supply. Great deal! Fast 2 day shipping when I ordered them.<br /><br />Subscriber."
Really enjoy these dried cherries,"I like craisins and other dried fruits that are chewy (like raisins, but raisins are kind of boring and common).  These cherries  are fantastic.  I've received a couple orders so far and shipping and packaging are perfect.  They come in a single 4 pound bag, so I split them into smaller bags or one big zip lock bag.  I sometimes give them out as gifts (a sandwich baggy full) and people are really happy to receive them and have many different things they use them for, from baking (biscotti) to just eating them as a snack.  I like them as snacks and as toppings on cereal.<br /><br />I probably would not purchase these at normal price (only because I am on a tight budget).  I am accustomed to getting them at a discount and a subscribe & save discount (total ~ $20 + free shipping)."
I'm torn...but I'm still eating them.,"I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky."
Very good!,"I bought these not realizing that they were not the regular CLIF bars...I should have known because they are much too cheap the original ones, but I was pleasantly surprised with these... they come in packs of two, and they are like a regular granola bar as compared to the soft/chewy consistency of the original CLIF bars. I loved these though, and the white chocolate macadamia nut was so yummy! I would definitely buy these again! Great value. But very messy, so definitely not recommended for a breakfast while in the car! ha :)"
Maybe not for everyone,"I put a heaping teaspoon of this product on my usual cereal (Nature's Path Heritage) and skim milk -- got really bad diarrhea for the next two days.<br /><br />I also tried the Nutiva's chocolate HempShake and I loved the taste of that -- I added about 8 oz of skim milk.  Seemed agreeable for two days, then on the third day the combination gave me several hours of rotten-egg flatulence like I have never experienced in my life.  Again, I had skim milk and hemp together in combination.<br /><br />Too early to say it's the hemp, might be the combination -- maybe hemp creates a digestive environment where the milk is indigestible. Usually I can eat just about anything so I was very surprised.  I'll give it another try someday...<br /><br />If anyone has any insight, please feel free to comment."
Good,"These are really good, small, but good with a little taste of rice Krispy threats."
Best tasting Honey oat bars,"These bars are tasty and delicious.  You get 20 bars for a decent price (depending if you do subscribe and save).  These bars are great for my little ones, they love them, and they are a good healthy alternative to candy or cookies."
"For anyone suffering from lactose intolerance or even celiac, and looking for a sweet and delicious snack, look no further.","I am lactose intolerant with 0% absorption and also suffer from IBD. These cookies are not only soft and delicious, but highly addictive and DO NOT bother my digestive system at all.<br /><br />Only downside is that they are so good, you may find yourself eating the entire bag. One of the best snacks I have tried!"
Basket Delight,"I bought this statehood gift basket to break apart the items into smaller gifts for friends/family.  It's over priced so I will not buy this again.  The contents are mainly food made in China,  like graham crackers and taffy etc. One of the reasons I wanted it was for the beautiful XL ceramic coffee mug in this set.  Basket/item  is really large due to all the fancy packaging like novelty wrapping/cardboard for bulk, so there is not that much in there.  It's fun to open and it will bring back memories of a state you resided in.  Overall I was delighted with it but not the outrageous price for China made items and some items listed in the product were NOT included in this particular gift.  ( items vary per set )"
Excellent,Excellent source of magnesium that helps you (1) Fall asleep at night withOUT harmful sleeping meds (2) allows smooth bowel movements consistently. And you control how much you are going to ingest. AWESOME!
Fantastic!,"I first tried Violet Mints several years ago and LOVED them. I recently found them again offered here at Amazon and I HAD to buy them. The flavor is unlike any other ""mint"" or candy you may buy. It truly is a floral smell and taste that is quite delicious. Whenever I eat them I usually get comments from others as to how good or fresh my breath smells. I would highly recommend Violet Mints. Once you try them you'll know why!  :o)"
Our dogs just love it,"We bought this to give our dogs treat that would be healthy. They are kinda picky when it comes to treats but, this was a great hit. The bag is resealable to keep it fresh! A must for your dog."
My new favorite!,"Have only had the Keurig for about 2 months.  The Timothy's Italian blend was in one of the sample packs.  One cup, and I was hooked.  Usually bold & extra bold are deliciously strong but also have a bite to them that ruins the taste of the coffee for me.  It tastes like the brewed coffee was burned.  The Italian blend has the perfect combo of strength & fullness, without the bite.  It is sooo smooth.  I know that everyone has their own taste in coffee, but to my mind this is ""kewl beans"" (don't know what that means, but heard it somewhere and it sounds right, lol)  Absolutely delicious."
Lots of chaff,"There was so much chaff in my roaster after roasting these beans that I had to run it in two cycles; the flavor was fine, but the process was messy."
Fun dog bones ....,I have 2 Jack Russells and they love these bones...they are not small but not too big for them :-) they cant get enough and they last long and they dont smell after a few uses like other ones.
Unzen,"I sent three of these items to relatives, all Italian, for Christmas.  All three reported that the panettone was dry and without much flavor.  I personally have not tasted this product; just reporting what I heard.  On the other hand, the delivery by the vendor was better than I expected, given the holiday rush."
Verified Purchaser of Cyclone Blend ~ By a Coffee Snob,"I purchased this on Amazon and have no association or affiliation with this company.<br /><br />I was skeptical because of reviews but decided to give it a try since I LOVE my Keurig!<br /><br />And we LOVE it! I like a nice bold cup but that is smooth... this is it!  I always put<br />it on the 2nd cup setting (above the espresso size) for all of the K-cups for myself..<br />my husb puts it on the third setting.  I made this coffee first for my husband on the<br />3rd setting and took a sip .... YUMMMY!!!!!! It was PERFECT... bold and smooth! I was<br />so excited! My husband took a sip and loved it too!<br /><br />I am glad that I can have one good full cup on the third setting and not two cups of<br />Emeril's Bold (which I love too) or Green Mountain Italian Blend (which I LOVE too).<br /><br />I did have one cup where some grounds were found on the top of the coffee... I was like<br />""Oh man... this is not good!!""  I just took a paper towel and skimmed it and they came<br />right out and it hasn't happened since. And we've had about 8 cups of it all together.<br /><br />I'm thinking that maybe with these cups you really do need to line them up right? Prob<br />not... maybe just growing pains for these guys.<br /><br />Seems like a neat company and I will be buying the Cyclone again when we get close to<br />running out!<br /><br />Please keep the price the way it is...!<br /><br />Lisa"
Ethical Coffee Nespresso capsules,"No wonder they were so cheap.  They don't work very well in my machine because of the ""biodegradable"" packaging.  I wouldn't buy them again."
All natural,"EVO has created an all natural, holistic, grain free cat treat and my cats actually love them!  We've tried many natural products, and my two girls usually turn their noses up to them.  But these treats they come running for!  Being grain free is especially good for cats with sensitive stomachs, which one of mine has.  You can also rest assured that EVO is one of the top brands for quality, so no junk in their products!"
Pricey but Good,I love this soup. Very hard to find in Florida. Thank You Amazon for stocking it
Awesome Tea,I bought this Tea for my girlfriend who is ery health conscious. So far she is loving it and it tastes good too. :)
best gluten free pretzels!,"We love these pretzels.  They are not always in stock at our local store.  Ordering a case from Amazon was so easy, delivery was quick."
Yummy!,"I love these cranberry/almond bars! They are delicious and best of all I know exactly what's in them. We eat these all the time for a snack. If you purchase these bars, you will not be disappointed!"
Great way to add extra fiber to your diet,"Started using these when I joined Weight Watchers a couple years ago and I'm very happy with them.  I had been ordering them direct from the Splenda website, but this six-pack from Amazon is a much better deal.  I have two packets with my coffee every morning, and find it an effortless way to add an extra two grams of fiber to my daily diet."
MMmmmm...,"My cats love this cat food!  All I have to do is stand near the food dish and they begin circling and crying in anticipation.  I highly recommend this product as cats love it, it doesn't smell too bad, and it's easy to find in most grocery stores."
"Great, hard to find product","Junket brand rennet is a must have for lower fat and no egg ice cream recipes. It is necessary for that old-fashioned-homemade taste, highly recommended."
Great Gum,"This gum is great. It contains some xylitol, which is good for your teeth. It's accurately described."
fantastic product and even better seller!!,"We first had this hot sauce on our honeymoon in St. Lucia and we were bummed that we couldnt bring any back with us.  However, we were able to find it here on Amazon.  I mistakenly had the shipping address incorrect (never changed to the new address) and once I noticed it and contacted Amazon and the seller, they were able to re-rout it after it had already been shipped.  I cant thank both the seller and Amazon for great customer service.  And the sauce is awesome, delicious and of course, HOT. Order a bottle and you wont be disappointed....unless you dont like spicy stuff!"
Madagascar Vanilla beans,These beans were very economical and the seller was extremely prompt in getting them to me. They came to me fresh and there were quite a few beans in the package. I feel that this is an excellent product and the seller is superb - would definitely buy again!
"Ummm, not the house favorite","Ours is officially ""the house of sugar"" and the Titans that live here have decided that these are about the worst cookies I've ever brought home!  They're about the size of their thumbs and well, they just taste nasty!  There's really no real cheesecake taste, just some sort of ""stuff"" there in the middle that isn't pleasing at all.  It's bad when a bunch of hungry boys will deliberately pass these by - that just about says it all, or so I think!"
Constant Complement +++,"This type of tea has gathered constant complements from early times in America and especially in the variant created by Ruth Bigelow in 1945. It is a fine rich black tea with a spice-mix based on orange zest, cinnamon and cloves. Even in its bag form, it seems like a tea follower's favorite personal blend. It is a rare tea that one can drink hot, icy or even lukewarm -- anytime with anything. Like some have remarked, as with most black teas, it is actually good brewed to a standard ratio of one bag per tea cup [five for a quart] -- and can be added to most other black teas -- so one can extend a supply of ""Constant Comment"" upon want or need. It is great hot with milk or cream and sugar or honey. When making iced-tea, it is well to add some lemon or lime and sugar or honey to taste, before adding ice -- as this tea seems just a bit sweet due to its spice-mix. It is good with a bit of rum too. ""Constant Comment"" can hold its own, alone, as well. ""Constant Comment"" looks good, smells good and tastes good +++"
Excellent Coconut,"First, this isn't your sweetened, find it everywhere else coconut!  It's an organic, finely shaved, unsweetened coconut with a dry texture.  I've used it for making coconut butter and it's awesome!  It set up in just a few minutes using a blender and it had a great taste!  I also use it for smoothies - no added sugar and all the benefits of coconut!  But, don't buy this if you are looking for a grocery store look a like...it's not the coconut you are used to seeing!!"
Not for me,"There's no question this product is very high quality, it's just I prefer a smoother tasting, less tangy Matcha. It's not for me, but you might enjoy it. I liked the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019FR0WQ"">DoMatcha 2nd Harvest  Matcha Green Tea, 2.82-Ounce Tin</a> better."
Don't be fooled,"Oh my gosh!  Who knew a ""chocolate"" chip would taste so good.  The only bad part is I ate much more ice cream so I could dip them then before."
"Not ""just a cup of tea""","As a life long tea drinker at the age of 65 I think I have tried teas from every corner of the world with every conceivable kind of water, in every conceivable type of container from which to drink.  I can honestly say after discovering Yorkshire Gold two decades ago, I have no other tea in mind when I drink tea.  Lovely amber color, great aroma, luscious flavor.  I adore the bags without staples and strings, and because of the size of the bag (much bigger than any other tea I've encountered), I can put one bag in the pot and it does the job. I do not use the loose because I am the only tea drinker in the house, it would be a waste. Not bitter at all no matter how long you steep the tea, and I have even used what is left from the morning tea to make ""iced York"" for lunch, and it is still amazing.  I can't suggest a better tea to try. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />After all the American sources dried up, I found Amazon to be the best buy on the net.  I order in the 5 box quantity to save on shipping charges, and it is always on time and packaged well."
took a long time -- not for caramel sauce,"First of all, I bought these with prejudice.  I'd recently purchased Starbucks sauce and syrup and they included the pumps at no additional cost.  I got spoiled.<br /><br />So I didn't think to order pumps when I bought Ghiradelli and Torani sauces through Amazon.<br /><br />After reading reviews and looking at prices, I bought these.  Disappointed.<br /><br />Got a workout pumping the Torani Pumpkin Pie sauce.  But eventually it came out.<br /><br />Broke a sweat pumping the Ghiradelli Caramel sauce so I left it alone for a while.  Thought the problem could be because the stem is too long.  So, I cleared away the caramel and trimmed off 3/8"".  Pumped some more for about two minutes and got a weak cough from the spout.  I thought to myself, ""it won't be long now.""  Except now, the pump doesn't even rise.  Got annoyed and started writing this scathing 1-Star review.  Looked over and saw the pump came back up and gave it another go.  Voila, caramel sauce.<br /><br />Changed the review to three stars for making me have to work -- Oh, and for the packaging or lack of; I'd expect them to be individually cellophane sealed instead of open in an envelope.<br /><br />*edit 02/03/12<br />Knocked it down to 2-stars.  Like another reviewer wrote it's not good for thick sauces, it definitely isn't.  The stem and spout are just too narrow.  I have to apply great pressure, put my body in it, to pump the caramel sauce.  Too much work getting my morning coffee.  I will spend more for the right pump."
Best Cat Food Ever,"My son urged us to buy this, after extensive research. We have a 17-year old cat who, while he remains healthy and active, is very skinny. After adding a mix of dry food and Felidae, his coat has become absolutely beautiful and he has added weight to,the point where his spine is no longer exposed. Wahoo, maybe Blackie will live forever!"
The best worms for the  best value,"If you are a true lover of SOUR gummy worms then these really are the best you will ever find. They are a personal favorite, I could never get sick of them and me and my friends love sharing these. They are soft, sour and just overall delicious."
Smoked Herring,"These smoked herring, packaged in a can that is in the box, are very good. They are<br />not packed in tons of oil, so are much healthier for those of us who want to maintain<br />a reasonable weight. The flavor is excellent, no tinny undertaste. I use them by<br />broiling them briefly with a small pat of ""good"" light margarine, i.e. as what the<br />Brits call kippers, and eat them for breakfast with a slice of wholegrain bread or<br />toast. They seem to be the same as those sold at Trader Joe's under the TJ brand.<br />Unfortunately, Trader Joe is extremely unreliable in terms of stocking them in stores.<br />For those who don't think fish is for breakfast, these smoked herring are excellent<br />as a canape or snack served with crackers. Highly recommended. A good way to<br />get those healthy fish oils, too! Best bargain on Amazon for smoked herring."
not that exciting,"My dog says these are just o.k.  They seems like they are mostly wheat with a little fish.  I wouldn't get them again.  Be careful if ""entirely pets"" is offering them to you for ""free"" because they charged me even though it said free with purchase.  I've been trying to get my money back for this ""free"" product.  We'll see if i do."
Want taste as close to Whole Milk as possible?,"We lived in the Middle East for several years, while my children were toddlers/milkdrinkers. Our milk choices were canned, reconstituted, dry nonfat, and several with indecipherable labels. Then we tried Nido (Europe). I had to experiment a little but finally came up with the best-tasting method. Mix it up in the blender - I think aerating it helps it taste fresher. Next, refrigerate it overnight before use. It becomes delicious! The family liked drinking milk again, and my tea stopped tasting strange."
Excellent,"This tea is very hearty...definitely ""double"" in spicy, chai flavor!  I recommend it to anyone who likes a stronger tea. And you can't beat the deal especially with the Prime program -- save a couple of dollars + free shipping!  Add a little sweetner and cream and it really enhances the flavors!"
Actually worked!,"After more than a year with no success and a torn up lawn, within hours of setting this trap I finally caught one! I have hope now that I might be able to rescue my lawn and finally get this gopher problem under control. I love that you can see if the trap has been tripped without digging it up."
Gluten-Free!,"I love these! These are soo good...even my toddler loves them. I always keep a few in the diaper bag for snacks on the go. I especially appreciate that they are gluten free. I myself am not gluten free, but my MIL is, and it is hard to keep healthy snacks (other than fruit) in the house that are gluten free. The Cherry Pie flavor is our favorite!"
So yummy that you will not want to miss trying these!!!,I Love these veggie chips. these chips are so full of flavor that you will not just pop whole chips in your mouth like regular potato chips. You will want to nibble on these and enjoy every little bite of them. They are also colorful and would look nice for serving guests. So Yummmmmmy! What a great treat. Each different veggie chip has it's own destinct flavor.Buy these to share.
ummm not sure about this one,i guess in my mind i wasn't really grasping the idea of 1b i was very shocked the price i paid for this ! i could have purchased the same amount and the same quality at my local drugstore for less than half the price
Yum!,"OK...I am a freak...I have always loved Fig Newtons..... since forever.....what the 60's.  Absolutely NOone in my family likes Fig Newtons.  Is everyone brain dead or what!  Anyway, these fig (fruitlike) Newtons come out and I am thinking.....OK, I could be eating these.  All I can say is WAY.....they are way cool.  I can't say I like them better than Fig Newtons....but I am sure my doctor would tell me bad things about Fig Newtons I would not want to hear.  This new stuff is light.  It doesn't have all that bad-I-will-kill-you-stuff in it.  They taste so light, but you get this fruit taste in them.  I could say I have died and gone to heaven....but I want to be straight here.  I am a true blue Fig Newtons guy who thinks these new pieces just ROCK.  Get some."
Tully's DEFECTIVE K-cups,"You should stop selling these DEFECTIVE Tully's products!<br /><br />I bought 2 packages of Tully's Italian Roast K-cups (48 cups) on July 20, 2011. I quickly discovered that all were defective. The airtight seal on each and every K-cup was broken and, when put into the Keurig coffeemaker, it spilled coffee grounds into both the coffee and the machine.<br /><br />I contacted Tully's customer service line, explained what'd happened and they couldn't have been more rude, condescending and unhelpful. They refused to send a refund or coupon through Amazon (to eventually credit my account) unless I sent these two boxes back and they inspected them. By the time these were opened a month later, the Amazon packing was long gone and these crappy K-cups were despoiling our pantry. My wife tossed them in disgust.<br /><br />Our first and last purchase from Tully's. Shame on them for such lousy customer service and for failing to stand by their products!."
"My dog loves them but they are not ""thick"" as advertised","I ordered a dozen or so and about one third of them I would qualify as ""thick"" the rest were a standard thickness that you can find at any pet store.  My dog loves them and he didn't seem to mind, and the price is still fair, I was just disappointed that they were not as advertised."
MEATLOAF,Very fast delivery from AMAZON. This Meatloaf with Potatoes & Gravy. Just as great as advertised.
Best Mayo in the World,Duke's Mayonnaise is the only mayo you use if you are from the South and know good mayo. It has a nice flavor that many mayos do not have.  It is a perfect mayo for making everything from homemade pimento cheese spread to potato salad to anything you would make using mayonnaise.
This is good for you.,"I've read through most of the labels in the cereal aisle at the grocery store, and this cereal is the best source of fiber.  I eat a bowl every morning with raisins and sweetener.  With respect to the yogurt which promises a regular system in 2 weeks. This cereal gently regulates your system within 24 hours.  It has kept me as regular as a clock.  The subscribe and save price is cheaper that that at my local grocer's.  I recommend this purchase."
Get crackin'!,"Pistachios by Wonderful are gluten-free and heart healthy.  I've tried pistachios of another brand and the fresh ones in the store.  These are hands down the best in taste and quality.  The nuts are all big and always fresh.  They are flavored the just right amount, roasted with no added oil, and sea salted.  A good source of Vitamin B6, copper and manganese, these nuts are worth buying.  The serving size is generous but also accurate considering how they're hard to put down.  160 calories per serving and a serving is 49 nuts.  This 16-oz. bag has about 8 servings in it.  Recommended."
"Hmmm, where do I begin?","These are weird little chips. They are nice and crunchy. The flavor is OK... but not good. The bags have 1.5 servings in them (so if you eat the whole bag they are 21 carbs; not 14). I doubt I will buy them again, but I will eat the rest of the carton."
CHANGE OF PACE,"It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products."
Good quality,Delicious aroma and good quality. One of the best choices for coffee. Delivered very fast. I will buy again. Try also the caramel aroma.
Still problematic for some dogs...,"I know ""Sweet Potato and Chicken"" sounds very appealing (I wouldn't mind having that for dinner, myself), but if you're trying to look out for your allergic pet, please remember that quite a few dogs that are sensitive to grains and gluten are also allergic to chicken. As long as you're switching to a ""Limited Ingredient Diet"" (L.I.D.), you should really consider buying a product that uses a different protein source - like turkey, fish, lamb, duck, or bison. And be sure to watch out for ""chicken fat"" in the list of ingredients (a hidden source of the problematic protein).<br />The Dog Food Advisor website is a wonderful resource if you're interested in purchasing quality pet food for your companion. It rates every dog food on the market, and tells you what's right/wrong with it.  The website has helped me make much better decisions on behalf of my 4-legged family members."
A well-balanced meal for baby,"We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  Also, our baby is a picky eater, so we're thrilled to find something she likes that's more substantial than Puffs!"
tasty japanese style noodle,both my husband and myself love this noodle! Really tasty and especially good in cold & wet weather. You can adjust the amount of power soup base to put in if it's a bit salty.
my second favorite,"If you're a fan of bold coffee, you'll like it. It's good, but it's not quite as good as Timothy's Parisian Nights. This one has a touch more bitterness and is not quite as smooth. The 2 pack box is a great deal!"
Very strong taste...,"These coffee candies are strong...there's not much of a milk flavor to them....let's just say if they were coffee instead of candy, they'd be closer to straight black than most coffee candies you find around...they are just sweet enough. It took me no time at all to get used to the fact that they're not overly sweet. I really recommend these candies for those of you who like stronger coffee and expresso...<br /><br />I, personally, love them, I bought five bags...and if you decide to buy them...I hope you'll enjoy them... :)<br /><br />I hope this helped... :)"
Better than Catnip!,Halo Freeze dried chicken is my cat's favorite thing to eat hands down..It only lasts about a week in my house.
Fog Chaser?,"This is a great tasting coffee. But not as strong as I was hoping for. I expected it to be stronger then the french and on the lines of Black Tiger and Jet. In my opinion, it's not as strong. I was disappointed. But still a nice flavor."
Wanna drink vanilla baby formula? Then this is for you....,"Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />""cocoa.""  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br /><br />It kind of makes me think of baby formula...........the other reviewer who said like a hot vanilla<br />milkshake is close to describing it but it is not creamy enough in my opinion to qualify as such.....<br /><br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and<br />clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~"
Nice little tweek,"Overall, I notice no change in the sweetness or flavor of this sugar substitute through the addition of the B vitamins. The usual slim paper packet has been replaced by a slightly more bulky thickened packet to preserve the nutrient content, but otherwise the product can be used in the same manner as the original item.<br /><br />The nutrient 'boost' is only 20% of the RDA value of B-1, B-5 and B-6, all water soluble vitamins, so there is little worry of toxic overdose of the vitamins in a healthy person (although, 1,000mg/day of B-6 has been cited as a toxic level, it is unlikely that you would ingest enough without recourse to multiple bottles of B supplement tablets). B vitamins are associated with healthy metabolism, hair, skin, immune and nervous systems.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not the full complement of B vitamins, neglecting several key members: riboflavin (B-2), niacin (B-3), folic acid (B-9) and cyanocobalamin (B-12). The addition of a few B vitamins is a nice little value-add to the product, but does not replace my B Complex supplement. Based upon Amazon prices, I can get roughly twice the count of normal individual packets for close to the same price. As an aside, the fiber supplement version might be more worthwhile. P-)"
add one bag of this tea,"I make a container of iced tea in this manner: 1 family size bag of Luzianne green tea. Add 1 family size bag of black tea. Add one bag of Stash's Double Bergamot, and some grated lemon zest.<br />The double bergamot tea gives an extra zing.<br />Then I fill the coffee-maker to 12 and that makes a container of tea. The ratios work."
Salty happiness! (When in season),"I love these soft salty seeds, they're the only ones I can munch on all day and never get tired of them. I must have gone through a hundred bags in the last year.<br /><br />But though every store carries them, I still have trouble finding what I'm looking for. That's because many bags (maybe 50%) are duds, filled with these little pebble shaped seeds, hard and awful-tasting. This is especially bad when Sunflower isn't in season, and of course at its very worst in early Summer when it's been almost a year since the last planting. That's when David really scrapes the bottom of the barrel and gives you 100% dud bags. Late summer is the harvest, and then the blood pressure induced heart attack stats spike. :)<br /><br />You can tell just looking through the window on the packaging whether you should buy the bag or pass. Nice long seeds are great, round pebbles are foul. I'm skeptical that the savings of ordering online outweigh the ability to inspect the goods before payment."
Vanilla Beans,"The bubble package had been opened when we recived it, so we have no assurance that the beans are safe or if they have been tampered. The aroma is not a ""vanilla"" aroma. We have used vanilla beans several times and have never experienced this unusual aroma."
"Ooooh, this is BEAUTIFUL!","I'm not even a honey-afficionado, but I can tell you this honey is special... The fragrance of Provencal flowers comes through in every drop... Lovely"
Ahmad tea is good to the last sip,"sorry for not writing this review earliey.received my order from amazon the Ahmad Tea English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) by Ahmad just before Christmas as promised.this is a 5 star tea with 5 star shipping too. good. winston nashville tn."
Bad Batch?,"Don't know if I just got a bad batch or something, but the package I received had such a strong chemical smell, and my dog seemed to like them okay at first, but then was drinking water like crazy, and puked it back up a few hours later..."
Mocha Heaven,"Pros:<br />Great mocha taste that doesn't overpower other flavors.<br />Lots of dark chocolate chips to satisfy chocolate cravings.<br />One bar is very filling and satisfying.<br />Lots of protein and fiber.<br />Made with whole grains.<br />Contains no high fructose corn syrup, or artificial ingredients.<br />Very little sugar.<br />Contains whole or nearly whole almonds versus little pieces.<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive than some other granola bars, but very much worth it.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I'd recommend these bars to anyone who enjoys the flavor of mocha.  I love these, they taste oh so good."
Mold in jerky,"I have been receiving this jerky via subscribe and save for a long time now.  I just opened the second pouch out of my last order and there is mold on the jerky!  The sell by date is 8/28/13.  The first pouch I opened out of this case was fine.  I went to return it, but it is not eligible for return!  Needless to say, I will be canceling my subscription to this product and looking for another.  This is too expensive to risk waste because of mold."
Tings,"A curious ""snack food"" and strangely difficult to describe: If an air kiss had an actual shape, and was sprinkled with salt..."
Excellent Product,"Has the three elements I'm looking for- great taste, high quality protein and natural ingredients. Use it for post work out and meal replacement. Great product."
tea lover,I love Steaz!  Tea is so good for your but it is hard to find a brand that does not contain 40g of sugar.  This product is much lower in sugar and much better for you than soda.
Peanuts for Peanuts,"I didn't like them. Nuff said.<br /><br />Too salty, stale tasting, just tasted old and overly processed.. Sure it was a good price, but what the heck am I going to do with an almost full box of peanut bags that I have. Save your money and buy fresher peanuts."
An Early Review: Biting In A Good Way,"I haven't had the chance to test this salt on a variety of foods:  this review is based on nibbling on little crystals right out of the bag.  I have just bought seven different salts and this salt (at first taste) seems to be the saltiest to me:  it bites my tongue as I bite into it:  I consider this a good thing.  I don't know if this is a mineral thing, a texture thing or even a 'my mind is playing tricks on me' thing.  4.25 Stars.<br /><br />I will update later with a more complete review (if I don't get lazy!)."
Not bad,"I own the original and REALLY like that one, so I decided to give this a try. I don't know if I expected it to be hot, but I wasn't convinced to reorder this one. It has a hint of something I wasn't liking in my bloody mary; maybe it was the peppers? I wouldn't hesitate to reorder the original, though! Great value here, too."
Terrible All Around!!!,"i was expecting something like a bunch of bully sticks but these are gone in literally 4 bites! even with my 14 week old aussie! it seems like a bargain but it's seriously not much at all when the dogs devour a stick in like a min.  they smell like they where dipped in motor oil or something awful. it get a bit better when you rinse them but still stinky and i feel reluctant to feed them to my dogs. my cattle dog mix turns his head when i try t give him these! awful treats, don't recommend to anyone!!! (i bought the beef basted)"
"No ""coffee"" in it and WAY too sweet!!","Bought this at a great price and Amazon did a fine job of getting it to me. I guess I wasn't a very informed consumer (my fault) because I was surprised when the ingredients on the bag had a sticker over it that just says ""100% Chicory"". So, there is absolutely NO COFFEE in it. I hate to be Mr. Precision here, but it really shouldn't be called coffee if there is none it. However, I suppose the same argument could be made for Soy ""Milk"". Anyhow, it is called Medium Dark Roast, and we were game since we did like the coffee at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans and do like dark, rich coffees. We made our first batch mixing 50% Chicory/ 50% Starbucks Bold Roast (our regular). We both could only make it through about 1.5 cups because, while smooth, it was way, WAY too sweet....like drinking Molasses. Today, we made 1/3 Chicory, 1/3 Bold Decaf Coffe, and 1/3 Bold Regular. Still way too sweet, and I have the chicory aftertaste still in my mouth. Unfortunately, using it at this rate (or less probably), it is going to take forever to get through all these bags.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing again and recommend you try a little first."
yummy for your tummy,"The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips."
Don't even miss the salt,"If you ever had their original soup you know how tasty it is. I love it. When I seen this offered with less salt I ordered a case.<br />You can tell the salt is less, it is milder tasting but still delicious , it's a winner for me, I love soups but rarely buy prepackaged because of the high salt content, this one is so good, I have a subscription for it to be delivered regularly."
Perfect for Onion Rings,I've used these for many things and the crunch factor is perfect. By far my favorite use is for crunchy onion rings. Fabulous!
Would buy again,Good tasting.  I bought these fro a graduation party where I served egg rolls and everyone enjoyed the sauce.  I would recommend and buy again.
Best so far,"I'm a relative newcomer to Keurig coffee, but I do know that I was generally disappointed in the drink produced. However, the Breakfast in Bed K-Cup produces a nicely balanced, not-too-thin cup without being too harsh. I still haven't achieved anything like what I can make either with my french press or with my drip machine, but it's definitely better than the at-work alternative, Community Coffee."
Taste great,"These cookies not only taste great, but they are prepackaged so you can just throw them in a lunchbox.  When you have a child on a gluten-free diet, saving time on food prep is always appreciated.  They are definitely a favorite in my house.  We love them.  They are small in size, but are the best tasting chocolate chip cookie so far that we have found gluten-free."
Love these candies!,"I love ""Jolly Rancher"" candies! Bought this pack because it would last me quite awhile and it was a great price. Great service and product! Thanks!"
SUGAR in the BAG!,"I was just at the grocery store looking at this series of teas and I recall very quickly passing up on the tea because SUGAR was listed as an ingredient.  The curious thing is, why isn't it listed under the ingredients on this site???"
Great!,"These are really yummy chips. Sweet and a little spicy. My mom did not like them, but I think they are great!"
yummy all by themselves,These crackers are a great healthy snack without anything spread on them. My only dislike is that they are a tad too sweet for me. I'd like them without the molasses.
Veggie Booty is Good Stuff,Veggie booty is a nice snack with healthy vegetable ingredients.  It arrived fresh with plenty of time before expiration.
These are amazing.,"I bought a bag at the grocery store yesterday and I LOVE them! They are crunchy and full of flavor. I like that the flavor is different (cheesy and spicy) which is a nice change from some of the other low fat chips I get that usually are sour cream/onion, bbq, cheddar, etc. It's too easy to keep dipping into the bag for more though so I have to just pour some out onto my plate, lol. You get a lot in one serving though and they're fairly healthy so I like that."
Bought these on bade in Texas,"These are amazing and I am starting to worry that I may have a hard time finding them again.  They are flavorful, crispy, and addictive.  I came here to buy these on Amazon and am sad that I can't.  I hope they are available soon."
Luv It!!,"I luv this tomato paste.  So convenient to use and gives great ""zip"" to many of my recipes.  Shipper is quick and efficient.  Thanks"
QUALITY PRODUCT!,Best Manuka Honey on market. Especially like the enclosed Analysis Report from Hill Laboratories that is sent with product. Gives you confidence you are getting what you pay for!
Weber Marinade- Black Peppercorn,"As usual,the service thru Amazon,was very good.I had used the product before,which is why I ordered it,and find it to be great to marinate steaks with.I ordered 3 packs of 12ea..The boxes were open , like when on display,the packs were not open and in good shape. There was one pack short,which I figured was just an error in counting,so I felt it would not be worth the trouble to persue.  Thanks RT"
Tullys Coffee - Average,Not a smooth taste; strong but without the quality taste you would expect. The way the packaging is makes me wonder how long they have been sitting...just doesn't taste as fresh as the normal ones I buy from Donut Shop. Going back to that brand.
"Full bodied, no-excuses coffee","All products from Pilao are excellent, including the regular coffees but the Reserva Especial is truly special in its purity and taste, from the moment you brew (it will fill the place up with a fantastic fresh aroma) until the last drop. If you like cream or milk in your coffee, try something else. This one is to be tasted black, like a fine 18yr old single malt scotch. It will make your Italian espresso machine sing like Pavarotti."
great product,well u get the energy u really want for the 5 hours and it really boast u a bit but that u will be calm again and need to rest.. not bad great product
These are Yummy......,"These are very good...yummy. My first impression was GREAT flavor but a little on the sweet side. I'm a chocolate lover and don't usually eat lollipops unless they're the ones with the chewy chocolate center.  These lollipops changed my mind.  The flavors don't taste artificial like other lollipops I've had. I tried Mango Tango first...those are very, very good.  They're tied with Pomegranate Pucker as my favorites.<br /><br />YummyEarth Organic Lollipops are not round balls, but are flat, a little over an 1"" in diameter & about 1/4"" thick.  Everyone who's tried them has liked them. I'm thinking of buying a bag of the Yummy Drops for our long car trips."
Best Flavored Keurig Coffee,By far the best flavored coffee for the Keurig.  Not particularly strong...use the 7oz setting...but very nice.
Hazelnut Van Houtte K-Cups,These are by-far the best Hazelnuts K-cups I've tried - and I think I've about tried them all...  Strong but not bitter - great hazelnut taste...
Not so good,I am not a person who fancies themselves a Coffee Diva or anything like that.  But I know a bad cup of coffee when I have one.  These pods are without a doubt the weakest pods on the market.  I've tried many many different varieties.  When I brewed my first one and looked into the cup - I thought to myself - Hmmm?  Did I just make hot TEA?  Figured perhaps it was a bad pod.  So... I gave another one a try.  Same thing - WEAK WEAK WEAK!  And the flavor isn't there to back up the weakness.  So.... I gave it another try - THIS TIME - with TWO pods.  Still insanely weak!  Basically - I threw them away.  Not even worth a desperate cold Sunday morning cup when there is nothing else in the house!!  Better to have milk!  Sorry folks!
Great for murdering gophers,I bought this contraption after a savage group of gophers was ravaging both my front and back yards.  I caught two gophers in about a week.  It is kind of a pain to dig and set it in the ground but it certanly works.  I did not use any bait. There are good videos on youtube on how to set this kind of trap.
Surprisingly good,"I absolutely love my Senseo, but the thing I had always been waiting for was options beyond Mild, Medium and Dark Roast coffee. Every now and then I need a different kick from my coffee and until now it wasn't a possibility.<br /><br />The Vienna Hazelnut variety is quite good for hazelnut flavored coffee. My personal taste typically doesn't leave much room for liking nutty coffees. However, I am forced to make an exception for this one. It doesn't taste fake or cheap like many flavored coffees do. I prefer the other two varieties of Senseo flavored coffee more, but that is not to say that I dislike this variety, it's really quite wonderful."
Badia the Complete Seasoning,"I have used this seasoning for the past year.  It adds zip, lots of flavor to baby back ribs, chicken, Jambalaya, eggs, etc. You will enjoy a wonderful balance of herbs to inspire your tastebuds to...experience robust titillating wonderful flavors unleashed in anything you like!"
Starbucks rocks!,"I have waited for the Starbuck's K-cups.  Finally, they're here!  I've only tried the Breakfast Blend and it rocks!  If you want a stronger brew then use the middle brew button but I find that the larger cup (3rd button on the B-60 and B-70) to work for me.  I'll try the others in the near future.  I've been drinking Gloria Jean's Capuccino (middle brew button) and Coffee Barista's Columbian.  They are excellent!  I like a strong cup of Joe but not bitter and these 3 are great!  You pay a little more for the Starbuck-s K-cups however, I feel it's worth it.  I'll pay just about any price for a ""GOOD"" cup of Joe.  People, stop your whining and enjoy your coffee -"
Best cat food ever,"Since switching to this product, my cat's health has never been better and he loves all the flavors - except for the sushi one.  He's 15 years young, his coat is fabulous - hardly any shedding and so shiny. Give your cat 6 months and you'll see a difference!"
If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee,"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off."
"Smooth, Great Tones, Beautiful Beans","I love this coffee! I will buy more of it. The beans are beautiful, smell so good when grinding. The packaging is paper and everything(beans included) is an eco friendly product. You must buy these beans if you are an avid coffee drinker."
Nice mellow chai tea,"If you like your chai flavorful but not too strong I suggest that you check out Higgins & Burke's Chai Tea.  This tea,by itself or with a little cream and honey or sugar is a wonderful alternative to a cup of coffee. No aftertaste or bitterness, just the spices of a beverage which is enjoyable and tasty.  If you are a caffeine junky it's still there!"
Great 1 pt. Weight Watcher Snack,"These are wonderful.  I'm a salt monster, so the things that will bump me off a diet are generally crunchy snacks.  You can have *eight* of these (about the size of a standard rice cake) for only 1 WW Point. I rarely eat more than two at a time, because they are pretty filling, and I add a bit of extra salt, but that's just me.<br /><br />I just wish Amazon had these on subscribe and save -- as it is, we run out much too soon."
Yummy!,I just tried popchips for the first time and they were great!  I immediately went online to find them and order more.  Only 100 calories in the .8 ounce bag - makes for a great afternoon snack at the office.
These are really good,"If you've never had them, they're like a cross between a cookie and a cracker. Kind of the texture of shortbread...but savory not sweet.<br /><br />The low carb version is fabulous too."
Excellent!,"I grew up with carob. I love it, I'm used to the toasted kind and didn't know that raw was available until now. Now that I've tried the raw version I won't go back. The raw flavor is lighter, more friendly and just tastes smoother on the tongue to me. With any carob powder know that it gets everywhere when measuring it so just be extra careful and gentle with it and you'll be okay. If you like carob powder try this version! You might be pleasantly surprised!"
Why did they change the flavors?!,"This used to be my favorite hard candy, but a few years back Lifesavers got rid of the original flavors (lemon, lime, orange, cherry and pineapple) Now I think it's watermelon, blackberry, pineapple, orange and cherry (or something similar). I don't like the new flavor line-up and I haven't bought Lifesavers since."
Best gum ever,This is the best gum flavor made. Why can't you buy it in the stores anymore? It's a good product and I'm glad I can buy it from Amazon when I absolutely have to have it.
Love them now - not so much earlier,"I first tried these with my twins when they were starting on solid food.  I figured they liked yogurt, so they'd probably like these.  And they did, but only for the first couple of bags.  Fast forward a few months when they spotted an unopened bag and pointed... now they love them!  Afternoon snack often features ""yoga melts"" along with a happy dance."
clean teeth for my baby,My dog loves these chews. He asks for them every night. Much cheaper to buy them here than try to find them in stores.
Excellent Quality and Value,"I was more than satisfied with my order of hemp seed, in both qaulity and value, and will order from them again."
Give in to the Raven,"My family lives off Raven's Brew- it has been our exclusive brand for close to 6 years now. Deadman's is my husband's favorite- a rich, dark brew with no bitter aftertaste. They have plenty of blends (check out their website)sure to meet everyone's fancy. The only downside to Raven's Brew is once you have it, you get hooked and no coffee measures up!"
Dog wont touch it,I bought this brand because I heard good things about it and I was comfortable with the ingredients that were list. When I tried to feed it to my dog he would not touch it and usually he is not a picky eater. This is not a negative review in any way against the product itself but just an FYI to other pet owners.
fringe,The Chinese Fringe Flower produces beautiful pink fringed flower several times throughout the year. The Chinese Fringe Flower requires good indirect sunlight and is best suited for patios or areas in front of a large window that gets good light. The Fringe Flower likes watering conditions on the dry side. Watering should be done through the foliage and around the base of the plant. The Chinese Fringe Flower can withstand temperatures down to 32 degrees F.
Could Easily break a tooth,"So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor."
can't taste the chocolate... go raw,can't taste the chocolate...i do not like these and neither do my kids...Our favorites are the pumpkin and pizza.
"Amazing, Delicious, Nutritious","My husband loves these chips. The are high protein, full of fiber, and organic. They are the perfect size to add to lunches, so much better for you than regualar chips. Only problem is they are not always available but we try to get them whenever they are."
Smells WONDERFUL,"I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.<br /><br />I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any ""dust"" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily ""stirring"", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says ""CHEMICAL FREE..."" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read ""HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE"" or ""BIOTOXIN FREE"".<br /><br />Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best."
Love these!,"These are my favorite bars, by far - just delicious.  I was having trouble finding these anywhere, so I was happy to see them available on Amazon.  Perfect blend of flavors, and they taste very fresh.<br /><br />They're so good, I may need to hide them from other family members so they don't get eaten up too quickly!  :-)"
My Dogs LOVE these Cookies,"I have 2 rescued MiniPoodles: Leo and Shannon.  When I initially got them it was obvious Shannon had severe allergies, which in turn limited both the FOOD and the cookies I could give her.  I read labels and searched all over for treats for these 2 pups.<br />Then I found these cookies, which they love and are both safe for them and they ""appear"" to be tasty.<br />I am thrilled to find them on Amazon as they are NEVER in stock at the store...once more AMAZON SCORES!"
Unreal,"I bought these on a whim and I have to say, worth it.<br />These are so tasty I have to keep them in stock. My new favorite comfort snack. Goes great with beer."
Great Little Tree,"Arrived very well packed and no damage. Came in earily April and was lush and green. Slightly different pot than on the site, but I acutally like the one I got better. I have had it over a week and nothing has shown any signs of dieing at all. I would definatly buy from Brussels again."
not good for small dogs,my dog was too small to move the covers with her mouth or paws- I don't recommend for any dog under 20 lbs!
mother of pop corn lover,It cooks well with the whirly popper and it's more popcorn than the other brands.
My dog loves these treats!!,"My dog loves these bite-sized salmon treats. They are in an easy-to-hold cube shape that does not disintegrate in your hand, and I feel good knowing it's all pure salmon, not filler. Great treat!!"
Price!!??,This is a great product!  However the price here is ridiculous!  I regularly buy it here in Texas and my local grocer(NOT WALMART) for a $1.49.  I guess if you have to have it then cost is no option!  Because it is a great tasting and fiery condiment!
Just what the doctor ordered!,"We tried Nutramigen and Alimentum before settling on Neocate. This is the only formula that works with our son. We won't try soy for obvious reasons. He does use a can a week, but we're happy to pay for him to eat well and feel good without upset stomach issues anymore."
Awful,"Tasted like a mixture between plastic and chocolate and I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth no matter what. I will definitely stick to the regular brand of brownie mix I usually buy, if any. I was better off making homemade brownies. These were just the worst."
Great for Older Dogs,"I won't comment on the price because that can change. We all do our best to find deals and bargains.<br /><br />This food is wonderful. I used to buy cheap, grocery store stuff and tried this on a whim. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />My dog is a little older and is missing some teeth. Since he is a shih tzu he also throws up from time to time after eating. (Do all shih tzus do this, mine has since birth) Anyway, this food seems to cut down on the incidents. The pieces are very small and easy for him to chew.<br /><br />It's good for him, a great size for my little dog, and I will continue to buy it."
Not great,"My family and I enjoy the salt & vinegar chips that lays makes as well as the kettle cooked chips, so we wanted to try these chips because we've seen them all over the market. i took a chance and purchased them online on amazon and I regret taking that the chance. We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips. I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before."
Delicious Licorice,My daughter and I were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the Panda licorice. We are very happy with Panda and will order again soon.
"Good, healthy food","Did some googling on kitten nutrition and found that the food I was feeding my kitten did not have very high water content and that she was supposed to be eating a meat based food (grain is no good for cats).  This food seemed to match well with what google told me, and I've been feeding her this wet food for 2 months now.  She seems to like the food and she looks great.  She seemed pretty healthy before as well, but there was a noticeable difference after I switched her food.  Her coat is shinier and softer, she's more energetic, and has been maintaining a good weight.  I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I think its worth the price and I will keep buying it."
Fantastic...except,"I bought this mostly on an impulse, mostly because I have a rule that between the months of October and November I must try any pumpkin related food I see.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to try all that much in the way of pumpkin product this year, so I'm trying to atone.  So, Pumpkin Spice Pudding entered my home.  This is pretty much one of the greatest pumpkin based items I've ever had save one thing.  Why, Jello?  Why?  Why did you put SO much cinnamon in this stuff?  It's *almost* enough to ruin it, but not quite.  The fantastic pumpkin flavoring is enough to overwhelm the overuse of the cinnamon, but let this be a lesson on any future editions of this pudding, cut the cinnamon by about half and you have a 5-star product on your hands."
fruit slice,we order these the price was very cheap for 5 pound we recieved it within a few days and the freshness was amazing if you have a sweet tooth these are great
"Great coffee, easy to brew pod","I have used these pods for several years now, great quality cup is brewed every time. If you have a pod machine these are some of the best, much better results than Senseo or store brand pods."
good oil,I am very pleased with this product. It's taste good. The little sit back is the tin itself. You have to pour the oil in an other bottle or will have a mess every time.
great for quick snack,"I have been buying Larabars for some time now and I have to say, they are the best source of ""good"" calories, especially for someone who deals with changes in blood sugars.  The nuts provide fibre and the "" good "" fats, whereas the dates are a great source for energy on the go.  I love the new flavours ( Peanut butter chocolate chip and the chocolate chip brownie).  My old favourite still is the coconut chocolate chew--I am a huge fan.  They are so much better than any old chocolate bar--in fact, chocolate bars not even in the ballpark as far as a comparison!"
the perfect travel size snack!,"Delicious and addictive! My kids and I love them! Perfect for a small snack while we're out! Nutritious? Well, it's better than a candy bar! I've tried many sesame snacks before - this is the right size, thickness, and taste!"
items were not as fresh as they are in the local grocery,"... I was excited to find these on Amazon, but i was a bit disappointed.  Unlike the bars I have purchased locally, the bar cannot be extracted from the wrapper intact; they stick to the wrapper as if they had not been kept in a cool dry place.  Except for the annoyance of peeling them off by pieces from the wrapper, they are still quite tasty."
Very delicious!,I got hooked on these for my salads when Costco carried them and of course they discontinued them. What a great way to get them as they are hard to find and not too cheap.  I am very pleased with the quality and taste and the fact that I can get them free shipping!
"tea OK, postage way too high","The sage tea is OK, but I was surprised that for 2 boxes from the same sender was I charged double the postage -- the tea weighs next to nothing.  Why not charge for the actual weight instead of a set price for each item?"
"Perfect for travel, fits all screw-top pouched baby food","Bought this at Babies R Us.  They are perfect for feeding baby on the go directly from the pouched baby food.  Although it says it was designed for Plum, it indeed fits most pouched brands including Plum, HappyBaby, and Ella's Kitchen).  The dispensing hole is bigger than some of squeeze top feeder so you can feed meals that are a little bit chunkier than puree food.  Pouched baby food is already easier to pack than jarred food, with this spoon, pouched food is the way to go for traveling with babies!!!"
Great Decision!,"Over the last few months,I've been becoming more and more aware of the fact that everyday products we use such as our lotions and toothpastes and hair care products etc. are actually items which contain chemicals and products harmful to us such as fluoride for example in toothpastes which is also in water supplies. Being that I'm a male who's only 23, I have slowly wanted to switch to more healthy,organic products for my health and body as I recently did with my toothpaste,a fluoride free brand called Tom's of Maine. I decided to do the same with my lotions and hair care products. I did research of what products,organic,which can also be consumed,can best be used for these purposes,especially hair, and after reading about apple cider vinegar and virgin coconut oil I decided to go with the coconut oil because I can use it on my body as well,and man was it a great decision! The first noticeable thing about the coconut oil is the smell...DELICIOUS. I find myself just opening the top and having a whiff before I'll even use it sometimes. Also,the actual feel and convenience of the product is great. It's a great alternative to high fat butter products. It makes my skin feel smooth and my hair is always soft and my scalp dries nowhere near as horrible as it used to. Really,in this last month,I find it harder and harder to find dandruff present. When I'm out of the shower,I don't have to have 2 or 3 or 4 different bottles for conditioner then grease then lotion,etc. I have it all in this one container! I simply rub a bit in my hands to melt it,massage it through my hair and when I finish my hair,I move to my face and so on. It's great! It smells amazing,it's convenient,and it's healthy in terms of the fatty acids it contains which our bodies need. I know it's ""different strokes for different folks"",but I'd recommend this oil to anybody. If you use it for foods and personal hygiene like myself,I recommend the 54 oz. container. BTW,super fast shipping! I ordered on a Sunday morning,I had it Tuesday morning and was using it Tuesday night!"
Tastes like popcorn,"This product tastes like movie style popcorn that is OVERLY salted, and I understand that popcorn is usually pretty salty but this might be a little too much. I would probably buy this again."
Awesome!!!,I have a 1 year old lab puppy...He absolutely loves this toy! I was unsure I was buying greenies and a rawhide bone and this was suggested. It Kept him busy for hours and He even slept with it like it was a teddy bear!
Delicious,"We got this as a sample in our new keurig elite. I plan on buying many more! Even my 6 year old likes drinking this with me. If you like tea, you can't go wrong with this!"
HOT & 100% PLEASED,"Excellent Seller with 5 Star Superb Quality Service and Communication.  Fast shipment, securely packaged and very pleased with  my purchase.  Highly Recommended and will buy more in the future.  This item is hard to find in my neighborhood and I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com.  My buying experience could not be any better!!  Thank you!!!!"
My weekend decadent pleasure!!!!,I drink all kinds of different kcups during the weekday including the ones I create myself. But on the weekends I have the ultimate treat for myself with the double black diamond. It is my favorite of all the kcups!!!!!  I love the value of the 96 count box. It fits my budget very well.
Great for everyday needs!,"This was orignally purchased because I use it for a scalp conditioner, as well for my hair. This product can be used cooking, but I like using the extra virgin organic coconut oil (not necessarily the same brand) for cooking because it gives off a coconut taste into dishes that make the dish really come to life, comparable to coconut milk, but need less ingredient for the flavor. Anyways, back on topic, this oil can be used as a skin conditioner for the body if used in a homemade lotion. Great product."
"Very easy to grow, my cat enjoys nibbling on it","I bought Kitty's Garden after I first discovered my cat trying to nibble on all the fake plants in my home.  I had to spray those with bitter apple just to get him to stop.  I was a bit skeptical about buying the pre-grown pots of grass from the pet store, because I bought those in the past for my gerbils and they wilted quickly after purchase.  I do not have a ""green thumb"" in any way, shape or form (hence all the fake plants in my place), but decided to buy this one because it boasted a nice variety of organic grasses for my spoiled cat and the wood container was adorable.<br /><br />I found this kit very easy to use.  So easy, in fact, that I started my garden in my office and left it on the window ledge there for the first week.  Of the four grains offered, I found that the barley one didn't thrive in my kit.  A bit of sparse grass grew from that compartment, but overall barley was a disappointment.  However, I still highly recommend this kit to any other pet owner that needs some grass for their four-legged ""pet-kid""."
cat owner for life,I adopted a Tabby Point Siamese some time ago and started feeding this brand after doing research on the breed. I learned that because of the breed's facial bone structure they tend to consume their food rapidly (much like a vacuum cleaner). The Siamese formula kibble is shaped like a Cheerio and requires more chewing before swallowing. This formula helped my pet to consume smaller amounts per feeding. Another benefit is the high protein content; more per serving than other brands. Also contains L-lysine for immunity.<br />A great price too; at least $3 less than at most pet food super centers and free shipping with orders over $25!
They just don't work,"I used these, hanging them very close to my swarm of flies, for about two weeks. The swarm of flies seemed to like about two feet off the ground above a Persian rug. I had about 10 flies. In two weeks, these TWO traps collected one fly, while the other ~9 just swarmed around and refused to leave or die.<br /><br />The flies popping into my house lately are different from the buzzing house fly I grew up with. The bzzzzzz house fly I can swat pretty easily. These new flies are silent and fast moving and not interested in ever landing on something. They are also long-lived.<br /><br />I tried schmalyn's recommendation and moved them around, even left on one the floor where they were swarming. Still no luck.<br /><br />I do not rec these traps.<br /><br />Afterward I got the SUPER sticky strips that you unroll. My flies were too smart for that stuff too, but if I waved them around I could catch flies in the air with the extreme stickiness that doesn't exist on these Victor traps."
Love this seasoning!,"This seasoning is good for anything.  Chicken, fish, pork, beef, veggies, you name it.  Also purchasing it in a 3 pack - we will have this for a long time.  The stores only carry the small ones... When you live far from a store, it's nice to have the option to purchase in a larger size."
YUMMY,"This is the best oil. Everything tastes so good when you use it, not greasy, french fries turn out golden brown and moist and fluffy inside.  I'm sure it is the oil."
"Energy Club Crispy Pumpkin Seeds, 3.50-Ounce Bags","<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JFKU9W"">Energy Club Crispy Pumpkin Seeds, 3.50-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>My favorite pumpkin seeds to snack on. Lightly salted and very crunchy with good flavor."
"Best Tuna I have found, worth the money!","I moved here from Australia, and I guess I didn't realize that we were lucky in that was a great range of quality canned Tuna. When I tried Tuna that I could find in the supermarket, aside from the 'steaks' in the pouch they no longer seem to see, that the tuna was almost shredded and stuffed in the can .. with hardly any flavor. I don't know where the heck they get that crap from and I can only picture this big cauldron full of tuna mush they put in the cans.<br /><br />This is different, completely different. I almost got scared off by the couple of bad reviews, and maybe it used to be better, but I have no idea, its still pretty damned good.<br /><br />It's like they sliced off a filet of the tuna and put it in a can ... exactly what I am used to. In my opinion you need to add some salt, but I eat it right from the can, its that good.<br /><br />Its a big deal having to buy 12 cans when you are not sure if you'll like it, so I found some at a local supermarket (it was kinda hard to find) and tried one can before I bought the 12.<br /><br />Ok, onto the tuna itself, Skipjack, I'd never heard of it. I have bought and tried both. The Albacore, in my opinion is definitely better, but it has WAY more calories per can. Now, the calories are mostly from fat, and its good fat, so not the end of the world. I still think the skipjack is a healthier option, but it definitely tastes leaner (and hence kinda more dry). I ended up buying both from Amazon on subscribe and save (6 pack of the albacore, and this 12 pack).<br /><br />Go for it if you like tuna. Its a lot to shell out for tuna if you don't eat it that often, but it was $4 a can at my local store, and that made it almost too expensive (I don't like it THAT much), so this really was the best option."
Otis will eat it!,"Otis is what I call a very picky eater. The fact is, until now, he would not eat the same cat food twice! He is 10 years old.<br /><br />I was in the habit of buying food one can at a time for obvious reasons. I did that for the Petite Cusine as well....the Tuna and sole. He inhaled it. I bought 2 more. This time 2 different varsities of the same brand. Again....gone.<br /><br />Since it is not cheap, I looked for it on line. Amazon had the best deal and I bought 4 cases of variety packs. That was almost a year ago. He still loves it!<br /><br />The other things I like are the ingredients. They are healthy for him.....no fillers."
Addictive!,"I could not stop eating these; they are the most interesting candy (because, really: let's not kid ourselves) I've encountered. My review would've been 5 starts, but for the delightful, but wasteful, packaging."
Has it's uses,"Like other reviewers have said, this may take a short time for your dog to get used to. The dog learns to lick the roller ball and get to the juices. This may not be as satisfying a treat as doggy biscuits, but I can see this product being useful for training. For instance, if your dog pulls on the leash when you go for walks, stop and call the dog to you. If he listens, let him have a few licks before continuing. I can also see it being useful for dogs who are overweight and whose owners want to cut back on calories yet can still give the dog a little treat for good behavior."
pricey but good if just a tad too sweet,the most tasty way to drink aloe I have tried. I have alot of digestive issues. Drinking aloe really helps with the symptons. Aloe by it's self is pretty nasty. This is a very pleasing way to consume it even if it is a bit too sweet.
One of the top two brands of Decaf K-Cups,"If you like your coffee a little stronger than mid-strength, this one is for you!  You would never know this is decaf coffee.  I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla;  too strong = bitter and undrinkable.<br /><br />Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional.  Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me.<br /><br />My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup.  This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!  (finally we agree on something)<br /><br />Enjoy!"
Fiber One Chewy Bars Very Satisfying,"The fiber bars were very satisfying when you have a craving for a snack especially, and do not want to eat something high in fat and calories.  Even children ages 7 and up will find this chewy fiber bar a healthy way of receiving a special treat!  I purchased this item from Amazon.com.  I was a little hesitant of purchasing in bulk, because I though it might possibly not be fresh.  It was very fresh."
"My dog loves it, so do the cats","I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver. The food is processed into small pellets about the size of a slightly flattened green pea which mixes thoroughly and easily with canned dog food, a bit of scrambled egg or a splash of chicken broth. However, our pooch seems to like it dry almost as much as mixed with other protein. Even the cats will nibble on any leftover bits during the day. Amazon offers a reasonable price and combined with Prime free shipping this provides a convenient alternative to hauling heavy bags of dog food home from the grocery store."
Quite good for this price,"We received this product in about 2 days, really surprised. It has two bags in a box, the package is good, having no defects. As for the truffles, I should say they are perfect. We just can't help eating one and another one and......so delicious and sweet. I think I will buy again for my family and friends."
Makes my hair thicker shiny and soft,"I was worried about using a oil product as I have pretty oily hair.. But this product works great on my thin hair.. I apply on damp hair, a quarter size amount into my scalp. I happen to love the scent and it makes my hair shiny, and thicker and very soft. For thin hair this works great!"
Informative review only....,"Nothing listed for nutrition or ingredients so this is what I found on asianfoodgrocer.com:<br />INGREDIENTS: Water, fructose, dextrin, turmeric extract, citric acid, turmeric oleoresin, xanthan gum, natural and artificial flavors, gellan gum, inositol, niacin, sucralose, tocopherol (vitamin E), pectin, acesulfame-k, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin b6).<br /><br />Apparently it's thought that ""turmeric"" has some sort of benefit.  Caffeine free, 30 calories, 7 carbs, 6 g sugar and 35% vitamin B6 (single serving can).  I'd really like to know someone's experience with this before ordering. :)"
Liquid gummy bear,"This product is basically sugar with lots of gums and bits of vanilla.  Kind of liquid gummy bear.  I was hoping for actual ground up vanilla beans in paste form which is available from Bright Earth Foods, unfortunately not available on Amazon."
Awful! No taste whatsoever,"Okay so I am on a diet and I love peanut butter and wanted to try something that was similar to peanut butter and i knew this wouldn't be too similar to peanut butter but this was completely awful...I even tried adding some sugar to try and get it down, reasoning with the idea that it may be good after all with a little added touch. No way! I could hardly get this down and was very disappointed. This had no taste and the worst subsitution for anything like peanut butter. i will say though that this product is guaranteed and Walden Farms will send you your money back if you don't like it just call them like I did.  Just proves it has to have some calories in it to taste good"
Endocrinologist recommended and do lower cholesterol,"These were recommended by our Endocrinologist because they contain stanols, but not sterols, and are noted to help lower cholesterol without causing harm.  We've been using them for 4 months, and cholesterol test numbers have been improved.  We prefer to avoid taking Rx drugs whenever possible, and do not like the cost and side effects of statins and other drugs for cholesterol.  Statins also block production of CoQ10, and can cause muscle damage, even kidney damage when rhabdomyolosis occurs (admittedly rare, but still a risk of statins)."
great buy,"I'm going on a camping trip and wanted to have enough broth with me for soup-making on the trip.  This is perfect.  It lasts well in a frig, and the taste is good.  There are brands that have more flavor, but I think the low salt is the reason.  The pour caps on the ones I got come off -- don't know why.  That's never happened when I buy it in the stores, but it's a minor problem when considering the cost."
Delicious!,"Scharffen Berger is American Chocolate at its finest. These are about as removed from your typical Hershey's bar as possible (even though the company is now owned by Hershey's). The taste is less sweet and more refined than your typical chocolate. Although I don't have the vocabulary to describe it's taste as well as I'd like, I will make an attempt. The chocolate, at first bite, is subtle and not very sweet at all, but then once the you crunch the coffee beans, the chocolate, along with the beans, give a nicely sweet but not cloying taste that is both delicious and unique. My guess is that most premium chocolate fans will fall in love with this tasty treat like I did."
Delicious!,"It is absolutly delicious, just too expensive to use very often.  I simply cannot afford to buy it."
Strongest k-cup I have tried,"This coffee is so strong, I found it bitter.  I even tried diluting it by brewing larger sizes, but I still found it bitter. If you are tempted to try it, I would advise purchasing a sample pack first."
Best hot chocolate ever,got the product fast.  Was very pleased.  Gave them to family. They thought they were great too. I do this every year. They can't live without this hot chocolate.
lots of sugar and a bit too expensive.,"My daughter likes these puffs but cheerios are a much better option because they don't have as much sugar  and are much more affordable, these are terribly overpriced."
We Love Zukes!,"We started off our dog with Zuke's Mini treats as puppy rewards. Now that she is bigger, she needs more. These natural treats fit easily inside her kong toys and in the middle of her everlasting treat balls and give her something different. We recommend Zuke's to everyone. My dogs love them and they are made without corn fillers or by-products, which are 2 things I check for when purchasing any treats."
Chewy Deliciousness,"I opened my Big Nut Bar to see what appeared to be a rice krispies treat coated at the bottom with peanut butter.<br /><br />After taking my first bite, I realized that the texture was far chewier then a rice krispies. This wasn't surprising, as dried peanuts are a bit tougher then rice krispies.<br /><br />All in all, I thought that the peanut bar was pretty tasty. However, it was a little to chewy for my taste. This should be avoided by all people who wear dentures, as one bite may take your teeth right off."
"At last, a canned food they will eat!","My two Siberian cats refused almost a dozen canned foods, but THIS, they could not get enough of!  Thank you!  A superb supplement to their dry food diet."
Canned Meh.,"There's nothing objectional about this canned coffee.  But there's nothing to enjoy about it.  ""Why Bother"" is the dominant feeling I get if I think about drinking another can."
"Great Gift, Could Use More Tea!","I bought these on the gold box deal for 12.50.  Great deal for a rather fancy gift for girlfriend who is going through finals.  She loved it!  It is both yummy tea, and mildly entertaining to watch the tea open.  It would be nice if there were more than 9 packets, but you can't really complain at 12.50."
My little ShiTzu loves these things!,"My dog loves the heck out of these things.  She will eat them up like mad.  They are great from a natural and ingredients perspective.  I bought the large case and give her about two or three a night.  I found they by accident in a St. Augustine, Florida pet store.  I ordered on Amazon when I got home to Kansas City because she loved the first bag from florida so darn much.  Recommended.  Great for small dogs.  Not sure that a larger dog wouldn't wind up eating the thing whole."
Ugh,"The turkey is okay, but the dressing is a gooey, flavorless blob, even with the gravy. It's remarkably taste-free considering the amount of sodium this product contains."
"Excellent, Top-Quality","I love this stuff, ever since a friend of mine sent me some from Thailand I've been hooked. I've been buying this here on a regular basis because it's so good. It taste almost like citrus but very mild and distinct flavor that is delicious. The smell is fine, I've never smelled fresh durian, but i assume it smells like this stuff just more potent, i like the smell of this stuff. The seller i buy from is Maxim eBusiness Technology, they can deliver from USA so i don't have to wait a month for delivery, I get free 2 day delivery with amazon prime which is great."
Wish They Were in China,"I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes."
Great for chewers,"I have 5 dogs, and they all simply LOVE this ring. It lasts quite a while, the first one lasted almost a year. Good for dogs that chew through toys, it's harder for them to chew on/grasp (no corners to focus on) but still keeps their interest because they have to try to figure out the best way to chew on it."
I used to love Caribou coffee.,"Save your $$ here.  There are so many other better k-cups out there.  Caribou coffee was one of my favs, but their quality has gone down significantly over the past few years.  This blend tastes very weak-too bad used to love it."
yummy!,"I Love these potato chip they r soooo good! =) sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate, not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness I will be ordering these again soon. LOVe IT!"
SOFT AND SWEET,A yummy brownie like cookie that ships well. Good price and got amazons super saver shipping. I have loved all the Pepperidge Farm cookies that amazon carries. One stop shopping these days. THANKS  :)
Nathan's Hot Dog treats,"Nathan's Hot Dog Treats are great - For my Toy Chihuahua it is the only treat he would eat - and we have tried many.<br />Also, it is the prefect size. Please do not stop selling this brand/item! Thanks for selling them-He loves them!!!"
All natural candy,"These are a good candy for children that need to be on all natural diets.  If eaten plain, they are no match for M&Ms.  They worked well in monster cookies, however.  At least, I thought so.  My husband and children did not agree with me, however.  I think these are an excellent alternative if some of the artificial flavors and colors found in other candy do not agree with you (or you don't agree with them)."
We Use This for Treats,"I purchased this food to give my shih tzu. We slowly introduced it by mixing it into his old food. Unfortunately my doggie can't tolerate it even though he loves it. We found that he'd vomit it up.<br /><br />So we switched to using this as a treat. He gets 5 to 10 little bits a few times a day as a reward. We still need to be careful. If we give him too many of the bits, he throws them up. But in the long run, a bag of this will last us a very long time and we will end up saving money on treats. And he loves the flavor!"
Hard-to-find tea is my favorite,"Lapsang Souchong tea is generally a love-it or hate-it item. As the label indicates, it has a strong smoky flavor which comes from smoking the tea leaves with pinewood smoke as they lay on bamboo trays. As a former pipe smoker, I liken the aroma to that of the Latakia blended tobaccos. I tasted this tea variety at a party once and fell in love with it. No grocery store in my area carries it, so I am glad I can buy it on Amazon for a fair price."
surprizingly small but dogs love it,"I have a 2 yr old Lab and a 1 yr old mutt I adopted from the humane society.  They both loved this bone, it was devoured within an hour.  With that said however the bone was a little smaller then I had imagined.  I probably won't purchase this again and insted will go with the Smoke House Mammoth bone which I also tried when I ordered this - they both love that bone as well and it's lasting over a week already."
Not great,"My family and I enjoy the salt & vinegar chips that lays makes as well as the kettle cooked chips, so we wanted to try these chips because we've seen them all over the market. i took a chance and purchased them online on amazon and I regret taking that the chance. We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips. I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before."
Neuro trim works,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KAS"">Neuro Nutritional Supplement Drink, Variety Pack, 14.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Sonic is the best, Trim second.  It does what it says and contains a dose of happy juice.  I love Neuro products.  I have noticed many improvements in my day to day life since using them. Mood alertness, and focus have improved,  resulting in more projects completed in less time. Alcohol consumption has even decreased. These are the first truly effective supplement drinks."
PG Tips Tea,"While living in England, I became hooked on PG Tips tea.  I love the tea and Amazon prices are always the best."
Not for dogs and cats,I only gave this product an average since I did not hook it up because I noticed it was for  livestock only so I returned it.  The best part of this transaction was dealing with AMAZON.  They transmitted a UPS return lable within 2 minutes and shipped it off.  Had my ok for refund within 3 days.  Now that's the way to do business.  I'm dealing with AMAZON whenever I can from now on.  No fuss...no muss...no dealing with robot phones.  CONGRATS AMAZON.
Terrible.,"I'll admit I bought these for the jar. They were on sale for $1 at the local supermarket, and I thought the jars would make nice candles.<br /><br />Tried eating one. Awful chemical kind of taste to the syrup. Threw away the pears."
Strongest k-cup I have tried,"This coffee is so strong, I found it bitter.  I even tried diluting it by brewing larger sizes, but I still found it bitter. If you are tempted to try it, I would advise purchasing a sample pack first."
Cains Mayonnaise,"Cains Mayonnaise is the best store-bought mayo, period, far superior to the usual national brands. It has a distinct flavour all its own.  I venture to say that it is the Platonic Idea of mayonnaise. It's a pity that it not to be found in New York City."
Not Dragonwell,"Just gave it a try. My review is simple - yes, it is green tea, but nothing close to Dragonwell."
yucky,"I was very excited to try this coffee flavor, but when I did, I was very dissapointed.  I think the flavor is too strong, especially since it tastes really fake.  It almost tastes like there is alcohol in it.  Since I ordered the double box, I gave one away to a friend who likes this flavor. I would never buy this coffee again."
RAISIN BRAN,"WITH VANILLA FLAVORED MILK, I ADD RAISAN BRAN CEREAL TO MY BOWL FOR BREAKFAST. I ADD FRUIT AND NUTS FOR HEALTH REASONS AND TO KEEP ME REGULAR"
An unexpectedly good coffee!,"I have never been to New Orleans and had no idea if this coffee would be any good; past experience has proved that 'coffee in a can' was almost always bad (but usually cheap). I like chicory though, and once read that Henry Miller enjoyed coffee and chicory together.<br /><br />This was an impulse buy. I saw this in the Asian food isle of the Food4Less store here in Portland, Or. for only 5 or 6 dollars. So if you have that store or an Asian market in your area, check there first. It'll be way cheaper, and plus, no shipping cost!<br /><br />It's delicious just black, not bitter at all, but great as well as with milk or cream."
"Takes time to appreciate, then WOW!","At first sip, I thought the Lipton Herbal Blackberry Vanilla Tea tasted too much like cherry cough medicine, with the blackberry-vanilla flavor just a bit too strident and artificial tasting. Kind of like overloaded hazelnut coffee. On second taste, I fell in love with this, feeling like it had a sustaining and alluring flavor. I can't explain why it feels sustaining, as it is caffeine free, perhaps the richness of flavor is at work.<br /><br />I triangulated with my housemates on this:<br /><br />Housemate the 1st: ""It has an interesting back note.""<br /><br />Housemate the 2nd (an oratorical type): ""It revives a feeling of nostalgia. It's not very tinged, not a wake-up coffee, it's a very mild tea. This is very, very good. This kind of tea leaves a taste on your taste buds, and doesn't stick to your teeth. I'm going to heat another cup.""<br /><br />So -- this is certainly worth a try if you like fun brassy flavors in tea. It contains real hibiscus flowers, rose hips, sweet blackberry leaves, dried black currant pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces and sunflower lecithin. It comes in an infusion pyramid rather than a paper bag, somewhat more tricky to compost but not a big deal."
"Very tender, good flavor Teryaki","perfect high protein, low fat snack.  very tender, so if you like to chew- this aint for you."
Wonderful!!!!,"I'm glad I found these because first off i love them and second they are very hard to find in my area. They always arrive fast(they have lighting fast shipping), they're always fresh, and packed perfectly in the box and arrive in good condition."
zinger flavor,"Fantastic bold citrusy flavor.  Not very spicy, but quite savory.  Packet size is just right for a single serving snack."
berry good,"This is a hearty,sweet healthy drink. A blend of vegetables and fruit it helps me to get my daily nutrients in a tasty form when otherwise I might not. Highly recommended"
Great quality tea!,My wife doesn't drink coffee.  She loves tea and we've tried all different brands.  Two Leaves and a Bud is consistently great and buying in this larger quantity is just a great value.
"I'm from Spain; before Amazon, I had to bring it from home!","Well, the title says it all. I grew up eating this kind of tuna and since I've been in the US (2003) I've had to bring it from home.  The tuna found in grocery stores here in the US tastes very different; it almost has no taste. My wife (an American) could not understand why I insisted on home tuna until she had it. Now, there is no going back for her either. The flavor is rich and the meat is not just shreds. Enjoy..."
great snack for diabetics,"I have type-2 diabetes and need a crunchy, tangy snack that isn't high in carbs.  Seapoint Farms wasabi edamame fill this bill perfectly:  they are nutritious, satisfy hunger, have great taste and texture, and combine protein with carbs, which diabetics need.  A very fine corn chip, potato chip or pretzel substitute for people with my condition."
Just like HOME,"I just love this strong blend of teas, PG Tips was given to me as a gift and I have searched for it until I had the good sense and good luck to find it on Amazon.com.  I ordered a large supply which won't last long for us, so will be ordering more in the future. Thanks Amazon.com from a very grateful Scottish Lass..."
Greenies,These are the best things since sliced bread.  I have been giving my dogs this treat for quite awhile.  My dogs love them and they were very reasonably priced.  I paid you $18.95 plus shipping and at Petsmart they are $32.99 plus tax for the exact same amount.  Thanks for the good buy.<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Danny Knowles
"I want larger, more feminine breasts","I have wanted to increase my breast size for a long time, I decided to try Fenugreek.  I was told to be patient, results could take months.  After taking two capsules three times a day for a little over a week, I can already see noticeable results.  I am ecstatic at the prospect of finally having the breasts I want, I think that C cups are almost definitely possible."
Best Chocolate Protein Shake on the Market,"High protein, relatively low in sugar, great chocolate taste, natural ingredients, and comprehensive nutritional profile.  With subscribe and save, it's the best deal I've found for these shakes. Thanks Amazon!"
Healthier option with great flavor.,"My family loves these and the fact that the primary ingredient is fruit juice makes them a somewhat better option than candy.  The pieces are a good size and the flavors are great.  Not the typical, boring, phony tasting flavors.  These are all unique and the pieces all have their own unique taste.  I use them as after work-out carbs and my wife brings them to work to keep her going when she can't take breaks.  Not entirely ""guilt-free"" snacking, but still a very reasonable option.  Plus, IT's SCOOBY DOO!! :)"
Very good compiment to most dishes.,"Either right out of the bag or juiced up with a cube of chicken bouillon, cayenne<br />pepper, or more saffron. Makes a perfect serving for 2 that goes great with pork,<br />chicken, or fish.<br /><br />Make sure you put a lid on the pot or this stuff will never cook. I learned the hard<br />way a long time ago. LOL"
5 stars for taste....4 stars for sugar,"Big Train Fruit Tea Smoothie Strawberry flavor is very good. Just about everyone in my family loves milk, so we add this for strawberry flavored milk & once in a while I'll add ice cream for a shake & I've also made some smoothies with it too. The label suggests mixing this with water, protein powder, soy, or nutritional supplements. My biggest complaint is the sugar content which according to my label is 34 gr in 1/4 cup of smoothie base.<br /><br />Because the label on my bottle differs from the product description on Amazon, I'll list it here.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving Size: 1/4 cup. Makes 8 fl. oz. blended beverage<br />Amount per serving:<br />Calories 140<br />Total Fat, Cholesterol, Protein & Fiber 0<br />Sodium 35 mg<br />Total Carbs 35 gr<br />Sugars 34 gr<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Seedless Strawberry Puree, sugar, water, natural and artificial flavor, ascorbic acid (Vit C), cellulose gum, green tea powder, potassium sorbate (preservative), sodium benzoate (preservative), malic acid & red 40."
wonderful tea,"I first tried Yamamotoyama green tea at a Japanese restaurant.  I was enjoying it so much, I asked the server if she would tell me what brand it was, and she brought out a box of this tea, and told me that is all they use.  I usually make 2 cups with each teabag, since I like mine mild.  The flavor is wonderful, and the price is good, very good actually for the quality. I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a great cup of green tea."
What the heck?,"What the heck is going on with Lipton Darjeeling?  It disappeared from every one of the Indian shops in the S.F. Bay area about 6 months ago.  The tin you see above sold for about $11.  This tea was one of the best kept secrets I know.  Now the only tea approaching ... and I mean it is not as good ... it is Peet's Darjeeling, at $10 for 1/4 lb. tin.  The only other alternative for Darjeeling is to go to some of the Persian groceries and find it there.  They sell a brand that apparently has lower-quality Darjeeling that appears to be imported from India into Iran, then sent to U.S.  You could probably find other ethnic stores that have the same kind of thing.  Does anyone have an explanation for what is going on?"
"SNPA Clone - 5 ""star"" beer kit","I purchased this kit back in August, due to enjoying SNPA.  I received ""all dry ingredients"" for this kit and brewed it the following day.  After 5 weeks of fermentation and bottle conditioning, I can tell you this clone is spot on.  A little cloudy after only two weeks of bottle conditioning (22oz Bomber bottles), but tastes great with a nice two-finger head.  After 4 weeks of cold conditioning, it has cleared to a perfect deep gold color and seems to taste better, leaving lace marks on the glass after every sip.  I highly recommend this kit to anyone that is a fan of SNPA.  I will be ordering this again."
Amazing Flavor,"I recently tried these at Expo West and they are amazing!  More flavorful than any candy bar on the market and full of healthy omega-3's, protein and fiber.  This is one product worth the price."
Crunchy,"Cookies a quite good. They are airy and cruchy. My only thing I don't like is that the cookies all taste about the same. And they have a good amount of calories.:( But, they are gluten, dairy and other allergen free. Which makes them great!"
Excellent flavorful cocoa powder,"I'd never used this before, or heard of it, so compared to regular Hershey's cocoa (which I managed to run out of) this had a noticeably stronger and better chocolate flavor to it when I made a ""Hershey's Collector's Cocoa Cake"" recipe from a Hershey's cocoa package around 1988. I've made that recipe dozens of times. This time I tried some and was surprised at how good it tasted, and I'd been buying Penzey's cocoa for several years. I liked this product just fine, no complaints at all!<br />---<br />We made the chocolate mousse recipe printed on the back of the container and it turned out GREAT. It's basically cream and gelatin with cocoa and sugar. Totally easy and more importantly COOL to prepare in the summer months. Serve it in wine glasses and it looks really fancy. The cocoa, again, carried the day. Deep, intense chocolate flavor. Pleased but puzzled to find a top-quality chocolate product from Hershey's, for some reason. Exceeds my expectations by a noticeable measure."
Truly delicious,"Cookie butter is everything it says on the package and more. It has a gingerbready, slightly nutty taste to it and it's almost exactly like peanut butter. It spreads well and it makes a wonderful ice cream topping when microwaved for 20 seconds (for microwaving, I recommending putting about two teaspoons in a little bowl and warming it up like that).<br /><br />Of course, it's not healthy at all. It's called cookie butter, what do people expect? But it has no trans fats in it or hydrogenated/partially hydrogenated oils. I recommend going to a real Trader Joe's instead of buying it online, it's much cheaper there."
Worth every cemt!,"I love Haribo for this product, they have the best gummy bears on the market and their gummy line is without competition when it comes to taste and texture."
No more anal gland problems,"Love Calif Natural venison dry.  Prior to this, had to run to vet for anal gland problems.  Since switching to venison, no more problems. No more loose stools or anal gland cleaning.  Thank you Calif. Natural.  Dog loves it and I'm real happy."
Research - Beatlejuice video - French version,I'm getting crazy.I'm looking for Beatlejuice french version video.<p>Is it really impossible today not to find the French VHS version of this film ?<p>Could U please tell me something about it ? Tks
very pleasant flavor and good quality,Milk Thistle is said to be good for the liver. It has a very mellow and pleasant flavor. I really enjoy drinking it. Alvita brand has always had good quality teas.
great gulabjamuns,"I have so far ordered them 3-4 times and always have liked them. You get them on amazon at the same price you pay for them at any indian grocery store, which is unlike any other Indian dessert that you find on amazon.  Price is one of the reasons, we keep buying them from amazon, followed by convenient 2-days shopping from amazon."
Good Tea,"I first found out about this tea when my husband and I went to England & France. When we got back in the USA, we found it in an international grocery store. I was so excited!"
Husband's favorite energy boost,"My husband loves this stuff. We ran out of it because I had a pending order elsewhere that fell through(they might have kept my money forever if I hadn't cancelled the backordered order), so, needless to say, I was happy to find a good price on Amazon that actually beat what I had thought was the best deal I could find. I received my product within a couple of days and am very satisfied."
Not the same recipe as the individually wrapped macaroons,"I bought these thinking they were made exactly the same way as the individually-wrapped macaroons.  I was disappointed.  They do not taste the same; there's a slight flavor of preservatives or something that's off.<br /><br />Anyway, I used to eat 4 ounces (2 individually-wrapped ones) per day.  When the local grocery store ran out, I ordered these.  It's been almost two months and I've only eaten 2 of the 6 cans (16 ounces/1 pound).<br /><br />The ingredient list for the product is also incorrect.  The canned macaroons have the addition of evaporated cane juice, whereas the wrapped ones have only honey as a sweetener."
Easy Taco Night,These are good. I made the hamburger/sauce up and froze it in three parts. I only use part at a time when I'm really hungry and too lazy to cook. They are good.
Oatbran Review,Thank you for your prompt shipment of my order. I will let you know how my meal worms like it. I will defitately re-order if things go well with my venture. Have a great day and God bless.
This is Not PURE Stevia but 90% FILLER added,"First off, just READ the Ingreients if you don't believe me!<br /> This ""Stevia"" in the RAW is NOT pure Stevia! It's really 90%....yes 90% FILLER! PURE STEVIA you'd use 1 TEASPOON for 1 CUP of Sugar, this crap they added so much Maltdextrin to make it equal to a cup of sugar.<br />Buy NOW FOODS ""Better Stevia"" if you want Stevia and save money. It will use 1 TEASPOON for what normally would take you a CUP of Sugar.<br /><br />This is outrageous! To call this ""Stevia in the RAW"" and then add 90% FILLER and I mean 90% FILLER!....is a JOKE! Stevia is 400 Times more sweet than Sugar, these packets should be a third smaller, but NOOOOOOOOO, they add crap Filler to equal the volume out with sugar!  There other title this company sell is ""sugar in the raw"" and that is 100% Pure sugar, so why here do they not also have 100% pure Stevia?  This is a RIP -OFF! If you want to pay for FILLER-ADDED crap then go ahead! *****If you really want PURE STEVIA, then buy the NOW FOODS ""Better Stevia"".<br />1 TEASPOON = 1 Cup of sugar. Why pay money for 90% FILLER garbage! Thank You"
"Good sushi mat, gross nori","The sushi mat is fine, works great, the nori is disgusting, tastes super fishy. But I got it mostly for the mat so whatever."
You get what you pay for and maybe less!,"Yes, PoP more than doubled the price of this tea after Dr. Mehmet Oz talked about it's health benefits, but the high-quality Pu-erh teas found elsewhere cost several times more, and for good reason.  Prince of Peace can barely get away with calling this Pu-erh because it is of such low quality.  If you really want to enjoy an exquisite cup of Pu-erh, try the higher quality loose or cake type Pu-erh.  It's a little more work to brew properly but the benefits and superior taste are well worth the cost and your time.  In a pinch, you can brew the tea leaves in a drip coffee maker.  When the brewing stops, carefully lift out the coffee filter with the wet leaves, tie it closed with a piece of string and hang it over the side of the pot so the packet is in the tea.  Steep it for 3 to 5 minutes on the heat plate of the coffee maker.<br /><br />As for the health benefits, I've never experienced such dramatic results so quickly.  The second day after I started drinking a better quality Pu-erh tea my high blood pressure was gone and so was my expensive prescription!  I was absolutely amazed at the fast results and an added benefit is that it is the best tasting tea on the planet.  I have never found any tea that has the natural sweetness of Pu-erh and the exotic, earthy taste is almost intoxicating.  I expected something this healthy to taste awful or, at best, tolerable but the opposite was true.  Some of the other health benefits may take longer to become obvious, but even if my lowered blood pressure is the only benefit that results from drinking this tea, I will be overjoyed.  If you've never tried it, do yourself a favor and shell out the bucks for the high-quality Pu-erh.  If you are drinking it to loose weight or burn fat, try brewing a 6-cup pot using equal parts Pu-erh, white and green teas.  They are all beneficial to your health and will help you attain your weight loss goals faster.  They taste great together too but you can drink them separately if you prefer.  Then drink a cup or two of chickweed tea in the afternoon to help remove the toxins from your colon.<br /><br />I wanted to give this product one star because of the low quality, but since it is Pu-erh and the taste is acceptable, I am giving it two stars.  If you want to try the better quality Pu-erh, buy a package from rishi-tea.com or teagarden.com. I like the option of buying different sized packages of tea offered by rishi-tea.com.  I also recommend the brewing instructions video on YouTube by Doctor Tea.  Try the real deal and you won't mind paying more."
"Tasty cookies, a few got broken.","Several reviews have pointed out the fact that some of their cookies were broken up inside the jar and it's true that some of mine have been broken in their packaging, however none have been absolutely pulverized and let's face it, they're going to be broken up by your teeth anyway.<br /><br />The cookies in this jar are just like the ones you're given on flights by several airlines. They have a nice cinnamon taste and a really great texture too. They're not overpowering and at the same time not addicting, you can munch on a couple and then stop without being disappointed.<br /><br />The jar isn't anything special, it's just a plastic bucket. It holds the cookies, nothing more. I typically take mine out of the plastic bucket and put them in something else (in my case an antique Planter's Peanut jar) a little more hardy to help protect the cookies better. If you knock the plastic bucket over you'll probably break up several cookies inside, which is inconvenient but won't ruin anyone's day."
SWP or not?,"Photo on Amazon shows package with SWP for Swiss Water Processed.<br />However, when I got mine I ordered it only said Mexican Decaf Organic.<br />Was coffee beans I ordered Swiss Water Processed or not?"
Great coffee at discounted price !!!,I love my new Keurig coffee maker.  I especially like the k-cups for discounted prices!
"So addictive, so delicious, so comforting","My bedside is almost always stocked with a bag or two of these bergamot candies, which I think are the best candies I've ever tasted. I love to curl up with ""in bed with blankie, a bear, a book & a bag of bergamot bon-bons"" (my husband likes alliteration.)(the bear is a refrence to our dogs as well as to my childhood Care Bear.)<br /><br /> He loves to come into the room to find me literally curled up around our sleeping puppy, as my iPad kindle app and a nearby scented candle cast an otherworldly glow across my contented face and the dozens of candy wrappers strewn about the bedside floor. It's gotten to where I almost can't read comfortably without my cherished candies!<br /><br />Taste<br /><br />The taste is a challenge to describe, but not a challenge to fall in love with. Though ""unusual"" by American palates, it is not an acquired or foreign flavor like rose or lavender, which we are more familiar with purely as fragrances, not flavors. It has a very sweet burnt-sugar taste at first, quickly melting into a complexity of full-bodied richness, very much like a strong, sweet herbal tea. Which is not a surprise, because the classic, well-loved Earl Grey tea is flavored with bergamot.<br /><br /> The pieces are a square shape that fills my mouth, and they last a good while. I usually end up crunching into them when they get down to a sliver, for a last burst of flavor.<br /><br />Packaging<br /><br />The packaging is simple, and recyclable. It's easy to dig my hand into the bag, pull out a handfull to keep right by my pillow, and grab one at a time. Unwrapping them is a snap - very important for someone with crippling juvenile rheumatoid arthritis - all I have to do is hold each end and tug gently, and the golden treasure is released in one quick motion.<br /><br />Price<br /><br />The only *only* drawback to being so addicted to these candies is the high price. That's the reason i couldn't give all 5 stars. Thank goodness they ship through Amazon Prime! I understand these candies are imported, but at the rate I go through a bag, and the cost per bag (I won't say so as not to date this review) these are even more expensive than they first appear to be. You may think ""$x for a mere bag of bon-bons?!"" and you'd be right. As in love with them as I am, I cannot always afford such a luxury. Hello seller, hint hint!<br /><br />So I wish wish wish that the price would go down a few dollars, or there could be a subscription service that ensures I'm well-stocked while offering a discount. I buy so often as it is, it just seems like good sense.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />The seller does have excellent cutomer service and superb selection of delights you rarely find in the States. I am a repeat client of the most repeating repeat purchases: I will *never* stop loving these candies. For my birthday and Christmas, the top of my list is a dozen bags, a true jackpot since I can only afford to buy two at a time. Imagine a dozen! And imagine a woman asking for CANDY for her 31st birthday!<br /><br />These bergamot candies are THAT GOOD."
Best baked bean receipe EVER.,"We tried the recipe printed on the bottle and it was amazing. I have to stock up so I can make these beans for every potluck. Delicious, subtle, spicy sweet."
Organic Earl Grey,"I love this tea.  It is almost addictive.  I try new teas all the time and this I am hooked.  Multiple cups per day. It's good for you and organic. What more could you ask for.  I try to support the organic industry when I can, it's the future.  Like green eggs and ham, try it you will see."
So unbelievably delicious,"These cookies are a chocolate lover's dream.  They do not taste like packaged cookies at all- and I can't even tell they are gluten free.  I will warn that you will think of these cookies all the time once you try them, so be careful when buying them in large quantities.  I have to hide these from my hubby and dole them out one package at a time every few days/day or so.  The two cookies per package makes these the perfect serving size to share, or not..."
mild but rich,"Not much of a description on the box and no instructions, but it's pretty much a tea bag that says this side down.  Let it brew in really hot water for 5 minutes and squeeze it out real good and presto you have easy to make single serve coffee.  I can't see any reason to put it in a coffee maker...total waste of electricity.  It is mild but strong enough in my humble opinion, but I hate starbucks coffee because it tastes too strong and burnt to me.  If you like your coffee dark and strong enough to stand a horse shoe in it straight up this may be too boring for you."
Crispy snacks....,"Well, they're not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but I won't be reordering.  While the volume of the bag was very good for a snack, the flavor wasn't that great. Kind of ""artificial"".  This goes under the been-there-done-that list."
Great tea but cannot reuse the kcup or it will burst,"After drinking this tea and using the cups for last month I actually really like the tea and the cups burst only if I try to use them again. If the cup is used only once, no problems.  I'd suggest these kcups to fellow tea drinkers, just buy at a good price knowing you'll only use them once."
Best Mint Tea I Have Ever Had,"This is my 'go to' tea out of all the tea brands and flavors I have tried. I average two of these tea bags at my office every day. I particularly like the fresh blend in Stash brand and I think this particular brand makes superior mint tea over other fancy tea brands. My husband and I each have a box in our separate offices and a box at home at all times. Yes, it really is that good- just try it and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />On a related note- we have tried the Moroccan Mint bags and the Premium Peppermint is much better."
Christmas gift for spouse,"My spouse has always enjoyed Maxwell House International coffee, French Vanilla. However in recent years the grocery chain has not carried this flavor. I finally decided to check on line and VANILLA OR VIOLA! She is very happy and set for life."
One of my new favs,Can never be enough chocolate for me and this coffee is quite satisfying to my need for coffee and chocolate!
very nice tea!,"I was weary of this tea at first, I opened the bag up and it was a fair amount of leaves but alot of little peices like it was ground up somehow, so I was like thats gonna be crappy..looks are very deceiving with this, its amazing tea seriously good I was really surprised, brew it at 175' and your not going to be dissapointed, if you use a full boil with any green tea you will ruin it. but all and all fantastic yamamotoyama"
Mushroom base,Jar of mushroom base arrived broken.  It has been replaced by the seller.. Promptly.  High Marks!! Thank you.
Great Treat,"Love these tiny little treats for my two dogs.  They like the peanut butter, blueberry and chicken.  I like to reward my dogs often but don't want them to put on too much weight from treats.  The packaging is wonderful for giving as a doggie gift."
Nutiva Organic Virgin Coconut Oil,"I use this when I fry eggs and they are the best tasting eggs ever! This oil will make your eggs slide right out of the pan,unlike butter that will burn and stick.This is a  much healthier product to use to cook with and it's also great for your skin, hair and nails.Try this Coconut Oil. You will be amazed at the difference in taste. Check it out @amazon.com"
Poor customer service,"I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective. I have learned that some products are made in the US, but when I called I only inquired about the erythritol, which they themselves confirmed was made in China.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />-I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things.<br />-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.<br />-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.  This was as a result of a legitimate concern.<br />-I did not know at the time that only some products came from China -- the customer service rep did not make that distinction when I asked. I was therefore worried about all of them.<br />-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.<br /><br />Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />This company should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it."
Cocaine is overrated and gimmicky.,"First thing's first: The taste. It tastes sort of like generic cough syrup, minus the medicine-like taste (if that makes sense). It doesn't taste like any other energy drink I've ever had before. So it's unique in that regard. It's not necessarily a good thing, though. I would have to say that as far as taste goes, I would not recommend it.<br /><br />Secondly, the ""spicy, burn your throat"" gimmick. It's just that, a gimmick. It doesn't taste spicy so much as it just makes your throat itch. I assume that the slight ""spicy"" feeling comes from the drink being cold, but if drank warm I'd assume it would taste like camel urine. All it really did was kind of annoy me, it didn't really add to the experience. Not that I was looking for the real cocaine experience. *wink wink*<br /><br />Thirdly, while it has a high amount of caffeine, it didn't give me quite the kick I was expecting. It woke me up a little, but it didn't do much else. But then again, I drink energy drinks like water so I have a high tolerance. Though I would not recommend it to others, if you value your health.<br /><br />My girlfriend said that the caffeine effected her more than it did me. She got more of an energy boost without the jittery feeling you may get with supplements such as 5-Hour Energy. She said that she enjoyed the flavor of the drink, so you have a second opinion there. She said that she had experienced the taste combination of cinnamon and strawberry. She enjoyed the ""spicy""-ness of it but agrees that it wasn't as strong as expected. Even though she liked it, she would only be interested in buying this again if more cans were added or the price was lowered.<br /><br />Now, here's where I would have to suggest not buying this product. Whether I liked it or not. It is TOO. *BLEEP*ING. EXPENSIVE. About $30 (including shipping) for six 8.4 fl oz (250ml) cans. You're better off buying something like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NCTXZY"">Power Horse BIG 16 Energy Drink, 16-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>. It costs about the same, maybe a couple bucks more, and you get 24 16 fl oz cans. And in my opinion, it gives you more of a boost, tastes better, and you get more for your money. It's a cheap alternative to the more well-known energy drinks (i.e. Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster, etc.).<br /><br />All in all, mediocre experience, mediocre drink, too costly. NOT. WORTH. IT. Save your money. Don't fall for the hype like we did."
WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN HYDROGINATED OILS,THIS IS A DANGEROUS PRODUCT TO PURCHASE IT HAS HYDROGINATED STARCH OR OILS AND IS VERY UNHEALTHY FOR THE BODY TO CONSUME.  IT IS NOT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION DUE TO THE HYDROGINATED OILS.  I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS AGAIN GOLITELY MUST CHANGE THEIR FORMULA IF CONSUMERS ARE TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
Great Taste,"I've tried so many different Jasmine teas and this one is my favorite. There are some I just do not like. This brand has a wonderful flavor. I have been drinking this for about 5 years now, it is a good deal if you buy this from Amazon on auto ship. You can't beat the price."
BEST EVER,"These crackers are simply the best in the gluten-free field. However, they are hard to find, even in the Bay Area, so I order from Amazon. The shipping adds a lot to the price; thus it is best to order a lot at once. They keep, if unopened, for a long time. Try them with a little butter ---- not quite as good as an onion matzoh (in my memory) but delicious nonetheless."
Takes me back to London,"It's been a while since I visited England, but this taste brings it all back: the clipped speech, the full-bodied tea and the bitter, bitter marmalade. If you're looking for a mild, laid-back marmalade, this is not it. The color is seriously dark, and the flavor of the coarse-cut Seville oranges is intense.<br /><br />I wouldn't use this marmalade for baking sweet muffins, but it will grace a piece of toast with majesty and reward every bite. The label says this marmalade is for the mature palate of the connoisseur. That's probably so."
Love these,"These are so good.  Don't try to talk while you eat one!  They're very chewy, so hold on to your dentures!  Very spicy."
"Great taste, great value!","This was my first experience with Roobios tea and I LOVE IT.  It's shipped in a box with the tea bags loose in a zip-lock type bag so it stays fresh and there's no hassle and no dealing with paper wrappers.  Huge box, great value.  I use two bags in a 20 ounce cup, pour hot water in and let it steep.  It's got a sweet taste without sweeter added. I also use it with green tea to make iced tea.  Roobios isn't acidic so it is easy on your stomach and you can drink it all day.  I'm now subscribing to have it automatically delivered so I'll never run out."
Best caramel K-cup!,These have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee.  The best caramel flavored K-cup I've tried!  I will reorder them.
"Great Quality, happy dog","We have a 1.5 year old Shar-pei/Pitbull mix rescue.  She came to us with a ton of allergy and stomach issues.  She was so sad as she had hot spots, swollen eyes, missing fur and irregular bowel movements.  Well we started her first on a bag of Precise Pork and Garbanzo Grain Free and it worked great for her.  Then I started hearing about Horizon Legacy, did my own research and decided to make a switch (mainly due to the much higher protein content).  Could not be happier.  She is on her second 28.7lb bag and she is thriving.  Her coat looks and smells great.  No more hot spots, and the ones she does get seem to appear and dry out the same day.  Being in Texas we cannot avoid the allergy issue entirely during allergy season but I cannot say enough good things about this dog food. Does not seem to be well known in my area as it is hard to find.  Made in Canada by a small family owned company.  Like other independently owned and run brands like Precise and Stella and Chewys their ingredients are locally sourced and these brands are never found on the pet food recall lists that are released.<br /><br />The price is very high, but you get what you pay for.  If your dog is sensitive to allergies like mine then this is worth a try."
Excellent Organic syrup!,Highland Sugarworks 100% Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup is a choice I'm glad I made. Its among the best maple syrups I've ever tried and its organic! I would recommend it to anyone...and have!
Excellent Chew for large dogs,"I have a Lab/Rottie mix who is now 2 years old. I gave him Nylabones chews at my vets recommendation when I brought him home when he was 8 weeks old. He loves them and chewed only the Nylabones, he didn't chew my furniture nor our shoes not even my houseplants. Now at 2 years of age and 98 pounds the nylabone ring and the nylabone wishbone are still his favorite chews and he still has the originals from when we brought him home. He is healthy, his teeth are in excellent shape and it keeps him occupied for hours. I highly recommend this product."
Num num bacon num num,"I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it."
Amazing!,"As others have stated, this isn't a good price, but the sauce itself is amazing!  Best way I can describe it is simply a sweet version of soy sauce.<br /><br />My mom always bought this at Sam's when we were growing up, then for a while we couldn't find it available anywhere.  I bought every type of sauce I saw that looked like it could possibly be similar, but I never found any other sauce of this type...<br /><br />I especially love the sauce with rice.  Just a plain bowl of white rice tastes wonderful with some Yohida's Sauce on it :)"
Farleys Rusks,The Farleys rusks taste good and my baby girl likes them but they do fall apart completely which is good in one side because it melts in her mouth but no so good on the other side since she needs to bite it for her teething.
As advertised,"The pumpkin was exactly as advertised. I actually bought it for my dogs, because we add pumpkin to their food daily...high fiber, low fat, very filling. (Only PURE pumpkin for dogs...cannot have ANY additional ingredients!  One dog has a propensity towards being overweight. I ordered this particular pumpkin because it was available in quantity, and I found my local supermarkets to be all out of pumpkin by late summer. (A shortage or something......) It was shipped within a reasonable timeframe, wrapped carefully, and met my needs perfectly."
High Amazon Price,$29.99 for a 12 pack if your order it on Amazon? Plus shipping? The local supermarket sells this for $1.99 each = $24
Buyer beware of horrible laxative effect. Do not feed to your kids.,"I was happy to find these in my local weis supermarket as I had never seen a sugar free option for the twizzlers and they are my favorite snack. I am very strict about eating the indicated serving size. I loved the taste, noticed no difference between these and the regular strawberry twizzlers made with sugar. One hour later I regretted eating these as I got horrible rumblings in my intestines and spent a few hours going to the bathroom with very bad diarrhea. This was like taking pure laxatives. Do not get this as it is not good for your health. You're better off getting the ones with sugar and just eating half the serving size of you want twizzlers."
Thank You!,"I wasn't sure how it was going to work out, but wow - my mom was really happy to receive the orchids.  I was a little disappointed while searching online florists and the amount of delivery fees that were associated with the purchase.  I ordered these for Mom and she received them 48 hours later.  They're beautiful, have individual water cases, and there were more in the order than I originally thought.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this way of delighting someone in your life and I'll be ordering these again.  Thanks!"
rich and smooth coffee,"Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product."
Keeps me on track,"I love this product, it helps keep things moving!  I use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting.  A great product for helping maintain your weight."
Great Product,"Great product for dogs with grain allergies. Not messy or crumbly. Cheaper to go direct to seller's website, pet food direct. com."
Just like the old days,"It has been a long time since I had these as a kid. Sometimes when things disappear and then get reintroduced, its not the same. But the first one I had was exactly the way I remember them. I would certianly recommend these, they are very good."
"Tastes great and is feeling, but should be renamed Flatulent Plus","Tastes great and is feeling, but should be renamed Flatulent Plus (maybe it's a little too much fiber).  Stays crunchy for a while in the milk."
Wonderful And Healthy Reward For Kitties,"I have given Whiskas Temptations Tartar Control Treats<br />to my Persian kitty for a long time. I would not buy<br />any other kind because I am so happy to see her so<br />eager to have one. She is twelve years old and I do<br />everything I can to protect her health. She knows that<br />she is greatly loved and she gives a lot of love in<br />return. She waits by the door of the room where I<br />keep her Whiskas treats and shows her appreciation<br />when she receives one by rubbing against my leg<br />and purring softly. She has learned several tricks<br />because the Whiskas treats were given as a reward<br />for her learning. I keep a big supply on hand so<br />that I will never have to disappoint her. My<br />vet assures me that they are entirely safe for her.<br />What a product! I hope other kitties will be so<br />lucky!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029O0XGQ"">Whiskas Temptations Tartar Control Tasty Chicken Flavour Treats for Cats, 6.3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 10)</a>"
"It wil not only make your dogs very sick, it may kill them!","I had to give it one star to register my review...If I could I would have the entire company shut down!!!!!  My dog ate a whole bag of these when the plumber left the contents under the sink all over the floor and I did not see Pele get the bag.  Shortly after she went into acute renal failure and almost died.  After a little research and learning these are made in China, I read over and over again about how sick people's dogs were getting when just feeding ONE treat of Happy Hips!  Through different tests done at the vet and ruling out what put her in the kidney failure, I have come to the conclusion that this is the product that almost killed my dog.  Yes she did eat the whole bag, but they are supposed to be JUST CHICKEN!!!!!  Please do not feed your dog Chicken Strips made in China, EVER!  Read the horror stories online if you don't believe me!!  Better yet, do not buy any food products made in China, you may want to do some research if you are, the stories out there are horrifying!!!"
Peanut butter delight log,I buy the smaller version of these logs too and I love the size of these!  They're hefty and they last a while.  Easy to open and hang up with the built in hook eye.  They hold up very well in warm weather too.  A nice alternative to greasy suet.
Wonderfully Tasty,"This product arrived quickly and is so convenient to have in k-cup format. The taste is bold and rich, and we love having it around. Plus getting it in a pack of 50 means you won't have to worry about running out too quickly"
Not very Pumpkiny but still very good,"This is a little light on the Pumpkin flavor but it is still very tasty, It's a spicy cinnamon medium brew that has a great aroma. We Like it!"
90s Decade Box Gift Basket,Excellent selection of candies and speedy delivery.  My son & his wife loved the candies while walking on the Appalachian Trail.
good,it arrived on time and the quality is good as i expected. i will purchase again and recommend to other people.
Great dog treats,My 3 maltese love these.  The product is great. J&B are a wonderful company to work with.  Thanks!
"A Delightful ""Brew""",I drink A lot of bottled water - especially when traveling. Plain gets old quickly so I tried a sample of this product and immediately ordered the 12-pack. Pour it in - shake the bottle - and you're ready. Just that easy and the taste is great. Not too sweet and the mix of tea and lemon is just right for my taste. This will be a regular reorder item for me. A great price and quick delivery from Amazon makes it even better.
slim Jims,"My grandson ate just about all of them, I should have hid them.<br />They go great with beer. It's a good thing grandson is to young<br />to drink."
"FIDO BELLY BONE caused SEIZURES in my dog, it has Rosemary Extract and garlic in it.","FIDO Belly Bone caused seizures in my dog.  It has ROSEMARY EXTRACT... and garlic in it which are  known toxins for dogs.  My dog almost died from this product.  GO online to verify.  I am not the only one who has had this experience with Rosemary extract and garlic. My dog is very young and he never had seizures before ingesting this product. Now that he is not ingesting the Rosemary extract (and garlic), he is no longer having the seizures.  Amazon told me that they are requesting recall on this product and other FIDO products with Rosemary extract in them."
Amazing - Favorite Beef Jerky by Far,"Omg... this stuff is an orgasm in a bag. But seriously, this is by far my favorite Beef Jerky. Texture, salt level, and flavor are excellent and is a definition of what beef jerky should be. People can keep their soft ""Natural style"" stuff, I'll take this anyday."
My cats love chicken flavor Weruva.,"My cats love this cat food and it's loaded with juicy gravy, which my male cat needs to keep from getting urinary tract infection.  Before using canned cat food with soupy gravy, I had to put water in their food.  Now I just give the cats their food out of the can with a few drops of high quality olive oil on top.  My male cat even goes into the trash bag to lick the can and lid.  I don't provide any dry food now because of my male cat's tendency to UTI."
Really good everyday coffee,"Tried this coffee and think it's a really good flavor.  Reordered the pack of the variety coffees and all of my guest say they really like it.  Even my daughter, who is a real coffee lover, said she thought it was a good coffee. I'll stick with this one."
"short-lived taste, but good for your teeth","The flavor is great at first, but doesn't last long.  If you're going for a long-lasting gum, this one isn't for you.  But, it does stay soft a long time, and fights cavities.  Also doesn't have Aspartame like other brands like brands of sugar-free gum.  Great to give your kids after meals to fight cavities.<br />I bought the XyliChew mints also, the mints are great & have the same amount of xylitol as the gum.  I would buy the mints again."
"Smooth, incredible flavor - you'll never view your morning java the same way again!",This coffee is soooooo smooth and flavorful - I absolutely love it! This coffee is so incredible you will never enjoy another brand again.
Good Stuff,"Decaffeinated Coffee isn't my cup of... but my wife loves it.  Also, a little cheaper than Bed Bath and Beyond."
Defective,All but a handful of the shipment were defective.  When brewing the water flowed through very slowly and large quantities of grounds were released into my cup - Gross.  The only way to use them is to empty the contents into a reusable k-cup.
Excellent Gift Basket,"We were really please with the Taste of Italy Gift Basket. There were a lot of great things to taste in here. Several of the items in the case have become household favorites and we've tracked down where to purchase them individually. My girlfriend is also giving one or two of these baskets to relatives for the holidays - that's how much she was impressed by this.<br /><br />So what comes in your gift basket?<br /><br />1) 7oz Bellentani Rustice Tuscan Style Salami. This is excellent. It's a very strong herb covered salami that tastes great and is sure to knock you for a loop the first time you taste it.<br /><br />2) 3.5oz Italian Herb cheese spread. Also excellent. It's great with crackers and compliments the salami wonderfully.<br /><br />3) 7.05oz Sandamiri Garlic Crostini crackers. These are amazing. The good news is you can purchase Sandamiri products on Amazon. The bad news is they don't have this flavor.<br /><br />4) 3.5oz Water Wheel wafer crackers. These were okay. Just your standard superthin wafer crackers.<br /><br />5) 5.29oz Spread Sticks. These long hard breadsticks are great with the cheese spread or mustards.<br /><br />6) .9oz Dolcetto Chocolate Pastry cookies. These are tasty and the chocolate is quite strong for such a little amount. Very happy with these.<br /><br />7) 2.4oz Crespo pitted green olives with herbs and garlic. These are TERRIBLE. I love olives and these things made me gag. My girlfriend had to spit hers out. These are nasty. I can not emphasize that enough. This is the one bad bit of the basket.<br /><br />8) .85 Caffe' Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee. I don't eat things with caffine in them (allergy) so I can't personally comment on these. High marks from those that ate them though.<br /><br />9) 1.3oz Amaretto Royale coffee. See 8) above.<br /><br />10) 1.2oz dark chocolate covered cherries. Who doesn't love these?<br /><br />11)  1 oz Hazelnut chocolates. Delicious. There are only two so they'll go fast.<br /><br />12) 1.6oz Honees. These are honey candies. I liked them but my girlfriend thought they tasted like very strong cough drops.<br /><br />Overall, you get a lot in the basket and aside from the olives (go with a can or fresh instead of these things), it's all quite delicious. I'd definitely recommend this to people who want to give a nice food basket to friends or family."
Love these,"Love these - very flavorful and wholesome.  I'm hooked!  Unlike the heavily oiled/salted/roasted almonds found in most grocery stores, these actually taste like real food."
"Pretty good, but. . .","It's good enough for a creamer, but I had thought it would be more chocolate-ly.  It's more creamer than flavor."
"Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good","I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!"
"easy, quick, delicious! :)","Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit<br /><br />easy, quick, delicious, one pan to clean up.  Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit is a lot of fun to prepare, and the end product is so delicious -- everyone wants seconds. I kid you not! Even Dad loves Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner! :)<br /><br />Everything is in the box except the chicken breast and the water...<br /><br />add a side of fresh zucchini-tomato-onion salad, a small dish of peas and carrots cooked with real butter, a few (chilled) jumbo pitted black olives, and you've got a really nice casual dinner.<br /><br />*off to order another case of Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kits from Amazon*  Highly Recommended! --Katharena Eiermann, 2011"
Best food on the market ...,"Great food for my pooch's coat and helps her produce a consistent stool. Switched from Nutro Natural Choice, which was fine too, but considering they are both priced in the same neighborhood and Wellness has a higher protein content, this made more sense.<br />But I probably wouldn't have switched from Nutro if it wasn't for all those recalls a few years back -- it really freaked me out. My dog is glad I switched."
My dogs dream of these bones!,"I have been giving these bones to my dogs for over two years now and they LOVE them!  Every night just before bed time they each get a bone and they go crazy when they see my take them out.  The mini size is good for small dogs, my female dog is 9 pounds and does not have all her teeth (they never fully came in)but has no problems with eating this treat.  I like that these bones do not leave any residue on the couch or bed and that they don't get slimey like raw hides.  This is a great treat and unlike the 1 star poster, I don't care that they come from China.  It is hard to find chews that will not make my dogs choke, are a small size, do not leave residue, and that they love to eat.  I have found all of that with these chews and highly recommend them!"
Love this Tea!,"I am a real fan of Rishi teas and my favorite is the Mystic Mint tea.  I used to buy their ""Sweet Mint"", but I believe this one replaced it and tastes just as good.  I drink this tea hot or cold and it never disappoints!  4 stars instead of 5 because they went to double packaging it in a pouch in the can & you get less (1.76oz for Mystic Mint compared to 2.9oz for Sweet Mint).  I would rather get more product and less packaging for the same price."
Yummy yum yum!!!,"Excellent product! Absolutely the best canned bread I have ever had the pleasure of sinking my teeth into. It is hard to find in my area so I was happy to be able to purchase it on Amazon. It was about the same price as the grocery stores and there's FREE shipping! It made this bread a bargain in my eyes.<br />I purchased 2 cases of plain and 2 cases of the raisin. The breads are sooooo fresh!<br />Easy to get out of the can if you remove both lids and run a table knife down, and around, the inside of the can. Use one of the lids to push the bread out of the can.<br />Try it if you have never had it. You're worth it!!"
Unique treat for dogs,"This is the most unique dog treat I've seen. The liquid treat is dispensed from a container that reminds me of a large lip gloss tube with a roller. I've given this unique dog treat ""4 stars"" instead of five as an average based on the varied reactions from my two small dogs. The smaller Malti-poo loved the treat and from his reaction would give it ""5 stars"". He immediately licked the roller, received the treat, and wanted more. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a pickier eater in general and wouldn't even try it at first. He finally did, but didn't seem to like it. We have the chicken flavor and it may be he just didn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Since our Malti-poo likes it so much, I have just ordered the three-pack that has chicken, liver, and bacon flavors. The three-pack is a better value than the individual packs and I'm hoping our Cavalier will like one of the other flavors better than the chicken. This is a unique idea to reward dogs with a treat without filling them up like traditional dog treats.<br /><br />** Update:  I ordered the three-pack and my Cavalier definitely likes the bacon flavor much better than chicken!"
Bobo's are healthy and tasty,First ate these when hiking in the Rocky Mountain National Park with my niece.  They are so fresh tasting.  I was also hungry and needed energy and they sure helped to renew me so I could make it down the mountain.  My son and I ordered them and the box of 12 was gone quickly.  I can't wait to order more and try the other flavors. I obviously would buy again.
A great tasting rice blend,"Many positive reviews are a testament to the quality of this product. This product is voluntarily labeled as being produced with Non GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) ingredients. It is nutritious, as based on the health chart, but also has a good taste along with an appealing aroma. I trust the Lundberg family's commitment to quality and have purchased their products for the last few years."
Cat & Dog both like it,"This seems to be a very good product but no different from any regular can of tuna.  I could pay a lot less and buy a can of tuna that will last me just as long for much less.  There are basically 4 strips of tuna in the zip lock bag. Which for me was very difficult to open after ripping the top off as directed.  I thought I could pull an entire strip of tuna out but as soon as I went to pull it out of the bag, the tuna strip fell apart and on to the floor.  That is how I found out that my dog loves tuna.  : )  The quality of the meat was good and the pets liked it so that is why I gave it 4 stars.  The fact that I can buy a can of tuna for much less made me take one star away."
My favorite T disc!,"I really love this coffee, and my co-workers do too. All of them were so impressed at how smooth, non-acidic, yet full-bodied this is.  I've tried pretty much all the different T discs, and this is still my favorite. Try it, I'm sure you'll be pleased!"
True Boysenberry Flavor - The Best Fruit There Is,"You know, I've been blessed to live in regions where I was able to have all kinds of wonderful fresh fruits, even very exotic varieties.  And of course I've had non-local fruits, including obscure faddish ones.  :)<br /><br />But I've concluded that nothing tops the boysenberry.  It is a flavor that is impossible to describe, because it is utterly distinctive.  There is no other fruit that tastes anything like it, even though it is a brambleberry and bears a close relationship to those.  If you have never tried boysenberry pie, I really urge you to do so.  I've never met anyone who didn't adore boysenberries from the first bite.  Just something about them.<br /><br />So I had some fear ordering this product, because many ""boysenberry"" pre-made products somehow lose much of the charm of real boysenberries.  However, this product is really excellent.  They are obviously canned berries, but they still offer up not only a surprisingly fresh berry effect, but they carry that true boysenberry ""something"" that makes these fruits so wonderful.<br /><br />I've so far just eaten these straight from the can as topping on marzipan cake.  However I full intend to reserve all of the syrup in my freezer until I decide what to make with it.  This stuff is precious.  :)<br /><br />My thanks to the other reviewers who left their feedback to help me decide whether it was worthwhile to try this product.  Pie is in my future!"
Our cat loves Fancy Feast,"We have a 11 year old indoor cat who looks forward to her Fancy Feast every afternoon.  She eats dry food, but we give her half a can of Fancy Feast to add some extra calories to her diet.<br /><br />We've tried several other brands of canned cat food, only to have her turn her nose up at them.  For some reason she really likes the Fancy Feast.<br /><br />From my standpoint, all canned cat food is stinky stuff, but I'm writing the review for our cat who thinks it smells great.  She likes the Ocean Whitefish and Tuna variety the best, with the salmon and shrimp varieties both coming in second.<br /><br />I like getting this product on Amazon because I get a 15% discount for signing up for automatic delivery.  Plus the shipping is free."
A Great Fun Cereal,"I have enjoyed this cereal for years. Unlike many 'fun' cereals it has a lot to offer both in nutrition and fiber content. I often treat myself to a cup, which is 4 grams of fiber."
Get only this Vedic Ghee for food !!!!,"I am very sensitive and observant to everything I eat and I am a very picky eater. I bought Ghee to practice spirituality better because Ghee is divine.<br /><br />In Bhagavad Gita it says, ""The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate.""<br /><br />Control of the taste buds and rising above favoritism of foods and hence emotions and life situations to seek Bliss is easier when using Ghee. Ghee imparts a love-like feeling to each morsel of food you put on the tongue, the inherent taste of the food substance is amplified by the divine feeling of Ghee. But the taste buds do not retain the taste because Ghee renders them unable to do so. So if you are Blissful spiritual seeker and eat a savory meal with Ghee, you are able to hold onto this bliss feeling undisturbed after meal.<br /><br />Ancient organics Ghee scores at the top, in fact it is the only Ghee out of top three in Amazon to have this love-like quality in it. I am thinking its because of the Vedic way in which it is prepared while Mantras are being chanted. Even the bottle label has  Mahamritunjaya mantra and Gayatri Mantra written on it. It has a great smell that reminds you of pure love and the taste is not so strong, feels just right. It is easily assimilated into body and it does not feel like I just ate a spoon full of lard. The other two Ghees ""Purity Farm"" and ""Grassfed Organic"" caused a heavy bloated feeling especially in the heart area like whatever fat I just ate got deposited there instantly. If you are serious about getting Ghee for health only buy Ancient Organics. I went to their site and bought the 32 Oz jar for $47 shipping included and I think using a teaspoon everyday it will last me two months minimum."
review,"This is a bit strong, I have had other brands that are more pleasing to the taste"
"Interesting little candies, but...","They are alright. Nothing super great. I bought 2 tins, and liked them at first but got sick of their taste after the first tin.  They dont taste the greatest for a candy and don't foam all that much. They kinda taste like baking powere, but the other flavors are super delicious.  The energy flavor is great."
"Good flavor, a little strong","This coffee has a good flavor, its just a little strong for my taste. I added some creamer and it tasted good, but I prefer Donut Shop."
Does what it claims,I had to stop giving my  15 year old cat dry food because he could no longer hold it down (even the ones with only whole food ingredients were too hard on his system).  He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.
a good treat,"Not the greatest thing in the world.  But for what it is, it's not bad, a good treat.  Though definitly not worth the $59.99 plus the $11.64 shipping, price tag."
Love them,Taste like cookies. 200 calories I eat one every day for breakfast. Vanilla is great too as is wild berry  my husband likes chocolate peanut butter.
Filling and delicious,"These noodles came out of the microwave smelling fantastic. I then strained off a lot of the water down to what seemed right, and added the soup base and oil packets. I tried a bit of each of these and the soup base had a taste simlar to cocoa at the time, and the oil tasted nice as well. I was quite intruiged to get things together and see how it tasted.<br /><br />It tasted utterly fantastic. I am not sure how people could not like these noodles, but then again I am not a picky eater. At the same time though, these are probably the best tasting packaged noodles I have had, alongside others such as Shin Ramyun and etc. These also have left me full for several hours.<br /><br />Some reviewers say that you may not like these if you are not Asian, but I am not and love them nonetheless. It might depend on how much Asian cuisine you have eaten and how picky you are though. Those who generally eat Westernised Asian dishes like general tso's may be in for a surprise; pleasent or otherwise. :D<br /><br />Five stars for being tasty and quality packaged noodles. Cannot ask for much more at this price."
love this decaf hot chocolate,I can give this to my granddaughter and not worry that she will not be able to fall asleep at night.  She even drinks it in the summer (a/c on).  Good stuff.
"Feline says ""meh"".","A nice enough product container, but my feline friend was completely uninterested; pretty unusual, considering how much she loves catnip."
Best Popcorn ever made,"We use this popcorn in our popcorn popper (Roosevelt Popper from Discount Tommy) and it makes the best popcorn.  Everyone who comes over for movie night says it is the best popcorn they have ever had.  We tried some other kinds, but now just buy this popcorn.  It is easy to make since everything is included in one bag.  Just cut off the top and dump in.  I highly recommend this popcorn"
Tasty but Burnt and Salty,"OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!"
Great Taste and Great Value,I order the team from this particular store in volume.<br />I drink it everyday and it tastes great
great Gluten Free cracker,"These are my favorite Gluten Free Crackers.  I do enjoy some other types also, but these are large and flat, very thin and crispy.  This cracker is great for lunch or snacking with a slice of good cheese."
"Delicious, what else did you expect?","Seriously, now. Tasty, tasty, tasty. Fresh, too!<br /><br />The only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings! Or, grabbing multiple bags to begin with. Pace yourself! I keep saying.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.<br /><br />2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kid's bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. It's really a good size for an adult.<br /><br />It's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag. Again, not too bad, but something to think about.<br /><br />Bottom-line: Delicious!"
Enjoyable tea,"The tea arrives in a timely manner. Is well packaged. I use this tea to make ice tea, I like to add a bag of peppermint tea to the brew. Makes for a nice refreshing flavor."
LOVE this stuff!,"Since it appears that my local Kroger/Ralph's store has stopped carrying this cereal, I reluctantly tried a few of the OTHER ""plain"" granolas locally available, knowing that they just wouldn't cover the bases that Heartland Original does for my taste buds. Of course, they just couldn't hold a candle to Heartland's delicious, high-quality products, as I'd expected.<br /><br />Granola, if made to be healthy AND taste good, is probably just not going to be the lowest fat thing out there, but even knowing that, I was still shocked to see that my local store's version of Quaker granola weighed in at almost 9 grams of fat for a half cup serving. My coveted Heartland Original granola is not low fat, but it's nowhere near that high! If my guilty conscience would just shut the heck up (which it never does), I could easily eat a two cup serving of this deliciousness for breakfast, and spend my morning floating on a foodie cloud of yumminess ecstasy... But, since I'm no longer quite so young and able to easily burn all of that off, I often restrict myself to a mixture of half raisin bran cereal and half Heartland Original granola. That way, I get the deliciously sweet, almost creamy, nutty and slightly cinnamon flavor of this exceptional granola,  paired with chewable (not tooth-breakable) raisins and bran flakes. It's my perfect morning decadence without all the guilt! And now, thanks to Amazon.com (and, even better, their awesome Subscribe and Save option on this product), I can get it for LESS than my local stores ever carried it at,  AND free, faster-than-I'd-be-able-to-get-to-the-store shipping via Prime!<br /><br />Happiness all around! Bring on the yummy cereal, I've got my spoon ready!"
Pamela's GF bread mix,"Fabulous product, hearty and tasty.  Just what gluten free consumers are looking for in a bread, pizza and pie crust mix.  Very easy too!"
nice & dark,Purchased for the husband who likes his coffee strong. This one was the winner.<br />Not bitter and strong enough to run cup again with a smaller amount of water to make a 20 oz cup of coffee.
Naturally delicious treat!,"These hard candies are absolutely delicious.  I particularly like giving them to the children because they do not contain any dyes.  They look at them strangely at first because of the peculiar color but once they taste them, they simply love them.  I suffer from chronic dry mouth so I always keep GoNaturally Organic Hard Candies in my pocket or purse.  Cherry is my favorite but lemon and apple are also quite tasty. Great value for the price."
New and NOT Improved,"I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste ""off"" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :("
Simply the best,"I love Drostes cocoa. We have many food allergies and cannot use the prepared baking chocolate, so I bake with cocoa. There is a huge difference between Drostes and the other brands. When I take baked items (usually brownies that are out of this world) to events, I label them to let others with food allergies what the ingredients are. Some people won't try them because there are no milk, no eggs, etc in my brownies. However, those who do try them keep coming back for more and say mine are the best. I have to agree, and I give the credit to Drostes."
Strong and Not Bitter,"I am actually a little bit of a coffee snob, but I found this coffee very nice. It makes a strong cup of coffee with no bitterness. I actually prefer it to standard french roast for its rich and robust flavor. This product is a winner."
Superior sardine,"These are large sardines packed 3 to a can. The flesh is a little firmer than regular supermarket sardines. Will buy again, definitely."
pretty good..,"Just received this from amazon, great condition and fast shipping. Great buy, 15 bags for $20...crispy chips with just the right amount of seasoning.  Much cheaper, than buying one bag for $4..."
Might be a bit bland for some folks...,"But with zero sodium in it I consider that a fair trade-off. Being one of those not-so-lucky folks who have blood sugar issues, I've been told that soy is a good way of getting one's protein, and when I saw this at the big warehouse store I decided to give it a try. I like the almonds and cranberries the best (although those do have sugar so I take it easy), and yes the soy nuts are not so flavorful and might not appeal to all. I see mention in another review about the pumpkin seeds coming from China, a valid concern, but I've been snacking on these for a few weeks and haven't seen any ill effects yet :)<br /><br />In the end, it is all about choice - and there are plenty of trail mixes and nut mixes out there packed with sodium. Your call, but as long as the big warehouse store carries this I'll keep on buying and snacking. I also took some into work and gave a sample to two healthier choice minded co-workers and they both liked it as well."
!!!!!!! Flavor review !!!!!!!!,"Best Flavor yet and instant favorite, cant stop eating!! : Choc Chip Cookie Dough<br />All time favorite snack: Cashew<br />Gonna try (next best thing ?): Chocolate Chip Brownie<br /><br />OK Flavors<br />Pretty Good but slightly acidic : Banana cookie<br />Tangy and sour for alternative taste: Pecan<br />Alternative to cashew with a Tang : Key Lime<br />Sweet and Tang : Carrot cake<br />Sweeter Chocolate alternative : Chocolate coconut<br /><br />Fail Flavors:<br />Too strong to put in mouth : Cherry Pie<br />Too sweet: Coconut cream pie<br />Forgettable : Apple Pie"
"Some of the best tea I've ever had...wait, maybe it is the best","A friend gave me a gift certificate to the spa where she works for my b-day last year. I got to swim, relax, and drink this tea. I swear on anything, that I wanted to steal ALL of the tea from the place. I also had the ML Ginger Twist. If I could live on tea, these would be my sustenance. I can't say enough about this tea, and am obviously not as well-spoken/written as the other reviewers -- but, dang! this tea is goood."
Dogs FAVORITE treats - stinks that they are sourced from China!,"Far and away these are my dogs favorite treats - and I've always liked the fact that it's really just pure jerky with a few added beneficial ingredients. She really loves the ""Duck"" Happy Hips the most for whatever reason, but she also likes the Chicken Vitality Treats and sometimes the Chicken Happy Hips.<br /><br /> She started eating these intially (when I first brought her home) because my local Safeway used to sell them at a decent price buy one, get one free. I would stockpile like crazy whenever they went on sale and as she got pickier and pickier as she got healthier these remained one of the few treats she would eat.<br /><br />Unfortunately I know that ""free range"" chicken (or duck, or any poultry, really) doesn't mean a thing as the requirements for a farm to be called free range are not stringent at all. Pretty much they will pile them up on top of each other but so long as they can ""touch the ground"" (not in cages) it's ""free range."" (Ugh, now I remember why I've been a vegetarian for 15+ years....)<br /><br />I have heard of a number of issues with the jerky chicken treats sourced from China and I keep closely monitoring her for any changes; in the interim I limit the amount of treats she gets anyway and the air dried raw food she eats is sourced from New Zealand. Hopefully I will eventually be able to find something to replace these with, but until then I'm fairly confident about them.<br /><br />After all, I feel better feeding these even if they ARE sourced from China because they are (at least) not irridiated and I feel better feeding these than the biscuit-style treats that have little nutriotional value.<br /><br />Unfortunately my Safeways finally stopped their buy-1 get-1 sales and raised their prices accordingly so I started orderign online via Amazon. I'm cautious whenever I open a new package of ANY kind of treats so I really like the fact that I now buy the larger packages for ""bulk"" discounts. It means I am using the same bags longer.<br /><br />Of course not all treats are for all dogs, and if I was starting from scratch I'd probably avoid feeding her these. (I really like Jones Natural Chews and would love to try their USA-sourced jerky) However, considering I'm on a very tight budget at the moment and she is picky beyond belief I have to made do."
The Best,I have a special sauce I make and have tried others but none have even come close to giving me the taste of mesquite this does. Not to much and not to little! Doing something right when I make the ribs they are gone faster than I can put them out!
AGREE w/ BEWARE!!!,"I LOVED Honey Milk Light.  They didn't have the Core Power 20mg protein available for a while, so I ordered the 26mg Core Power while they were in tranistion--anxiously awaiting the Core Power 20mg (supposed to be 'same as' Honey Milk).  I read the BEWARE review regarding the Core Power 20mg, but thought I would try it anyway.  MISTAKE.  I can actually TASTE the sugar alcohol.  Not good.  Tastes terrible and not good for your body.  They really did totally screw up the formula when they changed from Honey Milk to Core Power.  If I could give the rating a ZERO, I would too."
Terrible Dog Toy,"I was so excited to get this toy for my 7 month old yellow lab.  When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever. It is loud and dangerous. The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily bruise you and your dog and break everything in the house. In addition, because I have hard wood floors, the loud bang of the hard plastic against the floor was unbearable.  Lastly, in the two days I allowed her to play with it, the rope became frayed and I kept finding pieces of string in her mouth.  I definitely do not recommend this item."
Something old and Somethin new,I have been in love with this tea for 20 years.  I add a little cinnamon to my gallon for a little kick and everyone loves it.  I will be buying more!!
Best canned clam chowder I've ever eaten,"I used to be able to get Snow's Clam Chowder at my neighborhood Food Lion Market.  When they stopped carring it, I was able to get it at Harris Teeter.  Then they stopped carrying it, and I obtained at at the Piggly Wiggly market.  Now none of them any longer carry it.  I was glad to find it on line at Amazon, so I ordered a case of it.  Now once, again, I'm able to enjoy Snow's delicious clam chowder!!"
love it,I ordered this last month and I am glad I did.  I will use this instead of lotion from my skin and hair.  This Coconut oil has a very light scent and makes my skin soft.
Great flavor without the Alcohol,Many recipes have Alcoholic beverages used in them. Not all of them cook off the alcohol and I have to make mine (PG) for kids plus I don't drink. I thought it was crazy to keep bottles around when you don't drink not to mention the expense. Very handy and tasty too.
Great alternative to simple syrup,"After watching a bartender in Santa Fe New Mexico mix a scratch Margarita using agave nectar, we decided to try it. Fresh squeezed lime juice and agave nectar . . . base ingredients for the best Margarita EVER!! Plus, agave nectar is good as a sugar substitute in coffee, cereal etc. We buy it by the case and end up giving a lot of it away to friends who love it after trying it for the first time. A nice little parting gift."
Coombs Maple Syrup,Husband loves his syrup.  I buy for special occasions and for a treat.  Most commerical maple syrups have no maple in them at all (look @ the label).  This is the real deal and so delicious.
memories,"I had these candies when I was a kid.  Long forgotten, I was shocked when I saw them online and had to get them.  They are the best coffee candy in the whole world-and their cheapest at amazon.com!!!"
Great,"I have a very picky eater for a cat.  Over the last few months he has lost some weight and his hair just was getting kind of rough.  The vet suggested to switch his food.  Oh my, this is a cat I adopted at age 5 and had to break him into cat food because his previous people had him on a diet of McDonalds!! So here we are 2 years later, he finally eats dry and wet food now I have to change the brand?! So since my dog already eats Blue Buffalo (which duh, I dont know why I never started my cat on this) I decided to let him try it.  The first 2 days he went on a hunger strike just because he hates change. Finally on the 3rd day he gave it a go and loved it.  Now we are almost 2 months later and his hair is the best Ive ever seen, he picked back up his weight and he is even being more playfull and entergetic.  I do have to say all my animals love this brand."
returns & expiration date,"This product has an expiration date..My understanding of this kind of packaging was that there was NO expiration dates..That was a negative surprise. local store would do just as well, then.<br />Also I ordered too many by mistake..and found out you cannot return these..<br />It would be nice to know that before ordering. like say so on the sales screen"
Great tasting popcorn!,"This popcorn is excellent!  We have tried other brands, but this is by far the best tasting.  There are quite a few Old Maids, but the taste makes up for it!"
Warning! Watch expiration date.,"Both of my children are on a gluten free diet. We eat a lot of these cookies and highly recommend them. I am not a fan of all gluten free options.<br /><br />The only thing to watch is the expiration date. We bought a clearance listing of the chocolate chip cookies from amazon (from amazon but not the full price item). The cookies were close to the expiration date and tasted old and stale - but we know the cookies taste amazing - so I'm sure it was because they were near the expiration. My kids didn't care so they still ate them.<br /><br />We buy these monthly through amazon and we have only had that happen the one time we bought the discounted cookies. My tip is if you do get a stale pack, contact amazon immediately. Amazon will back their products but get a replacement because these cookies are worth trying!<br /><br />This review is specifically about the chocolate chip cookies but we also love the chocolate cookies <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T348UW"">Pamela's Products Simple Bites Wheat-Free Gluten-Free Mini Cookies Extreme Chocolate -- 7 oz</a> and ginger snaps <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILILM0"">Pamela's Products Simplebites Ginger Mini Snapz, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>(I HATE ginger snap cookies but love these)."
Great steaks -- Horrible delivery,"I ordered 12 steaks but only six arrived.  I contacted Omaha and they said they would send six more.  When the six more arrived they were completely thawed and now I am afraid to eat them  -- maybe I will fry them up and give them to my dog -- he has a strong stomach.  The six that arrived on time and still frozen were delicious. If this were baseball I would be thrilled, but I am not happy batting .500 in the steak department.<br /><br />Update:  Omaha sent me 12 more steaks.  They arrived still frozen and the two I have eaten were delicious.<br /><br />So all told, I originally ordered 12 -- only six arrived -- six more were sent but were thawed -- but then they sent 12 and they were great.  So in the end I ordered 12, but got 18 great steaks.  Omaha made it more than right.  Omaha may not be good at counting but they get an A for effort."
Pellegrino Lover,I can only find these in the can now if I go to a grocery store.  I think that they taste so much better from the glass bottles. Which I can only find on amazon now. It taste very good and I love the lemon flavor. They should make more than just 6 in a pack i think!!
Sylvia's Baby Lima Beans,Born in New York but great Southern cooking. Very difficult to find in stores but dont hesitate to order online and with free shipping the price shouldnt stop you. These Lima's are slow cooked with Bacon Smoke flavor and melt in your mouth. I love all lima beans but these are my very favorite. Eat them slowly. Enjoy the taste.
Another wonderful natural snack,"I have always enjoyed 'Terra' exotic vegetable chips. I have tried their other chip products, however I prefer these because of the variety. If you enjoy this product, I recommend that you purchase it through Amazon so that you can purchase the 1 ounce packages at a reasonable price."
I'm a believer,"I ordered this product because of the Dr Oz show for anti-aging, a nice by product is I swear my knee pain has improved since I started drinking a cup a day, oh yeah and it taste good."
Good basic tea before bed.,I enjoy drinking this tea with a little crumpet during the evening.  It's very basic at a great price.
AWESOME Food Product,"My wife and I recently became vegetarians, some days its a little harried to get home, kick off your shoes relax a minute before you start dinner..FANTASTIC FOODS to the rescue...some days when you need help to get a meal out in a few minutes..FF does the job well..we have tried several different flavors like the Taco filling, Tofu Scramble, Hummus, Sloopy Joe's, Vegetarian Chili, Falafel...none of which have dissapointed us and as you can see I am semi-retired chef. The best part is the  ease of preparation...amazing flavors with no meat!! and nothing really strange in the ingredients label. We have learned to buy it by the case as it can be somewhat expensive at most grocery stores as they price it like a specialty product...I'll put it to you this way..it taste go enough to fool most meat eating palates and if you want to turn the kids over quick..use the Sloppy Joe's as much as the Taco Filling.  The taste is a winner!! Bon Apettit!"
Excellent!,"This is the best blackcurrant preserves I've had. Strong in blackcurrant taste, mild in tartness and easy to spread. Very rich in flavor and texture. If you like blackcurrant, you'll like this. The current price is a great deal too."
Coffee Cake recipe got rave reviews from my non-gluten-free friends.,I would have to agree that this mix is great. I just made the coffee cake this past weekend and was worried that my non-gluten free friends wouldn't like it.  They loved it! 1 person even asked me for the recipe. ( I even made it sugar-free with Stevia.) I highly recommend this mix as well.
My dog loves them!,I only feed my dog organic products and treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  They are perfect for training and she loves them!
Not like Dr. Pepper!,"Because it has ""Dr."" in its name, you think you're getting a Dr. Pepper knockoff.  Instead, you get only the cherry flavor of Dr. Pepper.  So, in fact, it's more like Cherry Cola than anything else.  I couldn't taste any of the other major flavors that are in the real (diet) Dr. Pepper.  It's not bad, but I really don't like cherry cola, so it's not for me."
NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,"I thought I was getting an Orange flavored chocolate mix (been looking for an orange-mocha blend).  This is organge only in the name.  It's not even very good tasting.  Overly sweet and not enough chocolate flavor.  AND OVER PRICED!!!  Please be warned, it not a very good product"
Sugar Free Cinnamin Candy,I've used this product before.  It is a great tasting cinnamin candy.  It probably is the best tasting cinnamin candy that is sugarless and doesn't leave an after taste.  The company was very quick and accurate in its delivery.  I was very satisfied.
Disappointing,"Tried using these packets to season some chicken for quesadillas.  Not very flavorful, although I didn't add any veggies as one would if making actual fajitas.  Still, it seemed like the chicken lent more flavor to the seasoning than the other way around.  I'll probably try a homemade variety next time."
Gives an Enjoyable Flavor to Your Boring Water,"Peach Mango seems to be the flavor du jour these days and it is one of the better MIO flavors I have tried.  The product could not be easier to use, just a soft squeeze in your water and drink.  If you have taller cups, you may want to give the drink two quirts to keep it from the watered down flavor.  The bottle claims to make 24 servings, but I used Mio almost daily and it lasted about six weeks for me.  The only downside is the force of each squirts keeps the MIO liquid near the bottom requiring a little stirring to spread it equally in the water especially in larger cups."
Love 'em,"I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are ""salt and pepper"", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor."
they love these,"Two member of my family have celiac sprue and so we have been plunged into gluten free living over the past few years. Although these are not organic, my husband and daughter do like these to have a bit of variety in their lives. There are only so many Larabars one can eat in a lifetime. If you are looking for a good organic snack type product and have not yet discovered Orgain drinks, run there and order them immediately.<br /><br />I purchased several varieties of the Thinkthins when they were on promotion. Best price I have found."
Not my cuppa,"Maybe it's just my crappy drip brewer, but this tastes, looks and smells weak to me, even when I add two extra servings of grounds. Might be better in a percolator or press."
Fig Newtons For Dogs,"Quite impressive, these are so good, I feel like eating them myself.  Soft, chewy, and my dog can't get enough!  Very good purchase, your dog is guaranteed to love them!"
Cappuchino powder,This product does not taste as sweet as the individual packets made by this same company.  Unfortunately they donot sell/package individual packets anymore.  So I just add Irish Cream creamer to it to make it taste better.
yum!,"I really enjoy this tea, after I had figured out not to use boiling water when making it. Apparently, white and green tea become bitter if the water is too hot and it is steeped too long. So, my recommendation is to let the water cool a little and steep the tea for about one minute or less. I says 3 minutes on the box, but to my taste that is too long. Quite a subtle peach flavor, not artificial tasting. White tea has more antioxidants and less caffeine than green or black tea. So happy to have found a tasty beverage that is good for my health and the health of the planet!"
LOVE this salsa!,"this is the best salsa I have found that isn't homemade. I go through one small jar a week from WalMart. I used to buy this at Sam's in the large bottle. But they ended up discontinuing it,  yet they still sell their chips? So I buy it here now in the two pack 47oz size. The cilantro is in this salsa really adds to the flavor!!"
I love this movie!,"This is another classic Tim Burton film, remarkably without Johnny Depp. I love to just watch this movie over and over all the time!"
BOW WOW,"Simply stated - open the pouch, dogs come thundering.  The smell drives them crazy, as it is a savory seasoned treat.  They struggle to contain themselves and not nip my fingers.  They LOVE these treats.  They would eat the whole bag in one sitting if I wasn't watching.<br /><br />Downside crumble easily."
Yeast,"If you are looking for yeast that does yeast things, this yeast is exactly sufficient for any yeast-based products you will be using yeast for.<br />The yeast comes in a bag.  The yeast bag is exactly sufficient for housing the yeast that you will be using for yeast-based products."
Clif Kid Twisted Fruit Ropes,"My grandson is allergic to red dye 40, blue dye, and yellow 5.  It is refreshing to fine snacks with out the dyes.  He uses the snacks at school so he is not subjected to the snacks they provide.  Red 40 has caused him to not be able to focuses, blue dyes cause him to be moody , yellow dyes cause him to be angry.  We spent 2 years coming to this concussion, now he is a happy young man who is getting As and Bs  in school.  Thank you"
greeeaattt!!!,This rice selection is delicious!  We have enjoyed all four varieties and the containers are easy to store and use.
Edited review,"The first time I received the grains, they didn't grow at all. The second time I received them for free, they grew wonderfully.Thanks!"
Dog Loves!,My dog loves these treats and they are lite too.  I have been buying them for the last 5 years
"it's alright, but I prefer Monster",I prefer the taste of Monster over this.  Amazon only sent me one can to try so I didn't exactly acquire the taste of this.
Vanilla wafers -- beware they can melt in shipment!!!,"These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!"
Great gluten free pasta,"I have had to be gluten free for the last 3 years.  I tried many different brands of pasta, with disappointing results.  Bionaturae is far superior to all the rest.  If you didn't know it was gluten free you would think it was made with flour.  It''s very good."
Great tasting hot sauce,"I first had this hot sauce at Tijuana Flats in Florida -- a great restaurant.  It doesn't have that much heat by some standards, but it is tasty!"
Excellent food and supplier,"The food's quality is evident from the ingredients list, as well as the fact that everyone who comes over comments on how soft and shiny our cats' coats are--even if they've already made that comment in the past!  The cats love it, and there have been no tummy-upset side effects since feeding them this (for the past year) or any other negatives.<br /><br />I also wanted to note that this 5-star review applies to this supplier, as well (who isn't Orijen direct).  They ship almost immediately every time I buy, and I usually receive my food within 2-3 days tops.  And this time, when they were unfortunately out of stock of the 15lb bag, they called me the day after I placed my order and informed me it would be running late, but would be shipped by this week--which, lo and behold, it was indeed.  They're fast, efficient, courteous, and the food always arrives safe and packaged well.  Thank you for providing an excellent cat food with excellent service!"
Terrific Treats,This is a great treat which all three of my dogs absolutely love!  I am now ordering it regularly and the price is great.
Love these chips,These chips have a great flavor.  My husband loves these and they work great in a healthy diet.
Addictive,"Can not be beat. They are simply addictive. Cheesy, spicy crunchy<br />Our family can not stop eating them You have to order these"
Contents have shrunk!!,"Duncan Hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes. I bought them all of the time. But now they, like Betty Crocker, have downsized their packages of cake mix. These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it won't bake up as high or as big in the pan. Duncan Hines just lost me as a customer.<br /><br />Pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes (at least, not yet). I will be buying them. If they shrink in size, I will bake from scratch."
Smooth coffee,My favorite blend of coffee for my Keurig. I've tried about 15 different flavors but this is by far my favorite.  Very smooth and not overpowering or bitter.  Was buying at Walmart but they stopped stocking it.  Found it at Amazon for the same price.
Best espresso ever!,"I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home). So I searched on Amazon and found this coffee, which has excellent reviews. I figured it couldn't be better than freshly ground coffee, but that it was better than getting some old gross coffee from the convenience store across the street. Much to my and my boyfriend's surprise, this coffee makes much better espresso than any other coffee we have tried over the past few years (and we have tried many, including expensive coffee from Whole Foods). I don't know about the other blends from this brand, but if you like strong rich espresso, this one is AMAZING. Try it, and you'll see."
fabulous coffee thee best,I love this coffee I love the senseo coffee machine it makes the perfect cup everytime and the pods are fantastic
tully's KONA BLEND EXTRA-BOLD COFFEE,"I LOVE THIS TASTY TULLY'S KONA BLEND EXTRA-BOLD, 18 COUNT K-CUPS (FOR KEURIG BREWERS)COFFEE!! THE STRENGTH IS SO EXTRA GOOD & BOLD, THAT (BELIEVE IT OR NOT) I CAN GET 2 ""tea-size cups"" OUT OF 1 K-CUP. MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THIS, BUT SINCE I'M AGE 78, ON LIMITED INCOME, I'M VERY HAPPY TO ""save"" MONEY, YET STILL ENJOY THIS WONDERFUL COFFEE!! THANKS MUCH. I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER THIS KONA BLEND, EXTRA-BOLD COFFEE. I LIKE IT. from lcbs88keys@Gmail.com"
Perfect gift for myself!,"I have treated myself to this beautiful gift set several times now and I can't say enough good about Numi's fine product.  Everything is perfect, from the exquisite tea flowers which are a delight to the eye as well as the palate, to the high quality glass teapot which does not spill when pouring, to the charming packaging which I find very reusable. The Numi company is truly wonderful and their fine teas are consistently the best I've ever tasted.  I will continue to gift myself and also the other lovers of fine tea on my gift list with this extraordinary Numi gift set.  You can't go wrong with Amazon's price as well."
Easiest Way to Give Cat a Pill,"This product was recommended to me by my cat's veterinarian.  The product really works with my cat.  It's not obvious when you order, but there are two sizes of pill pockets, and this is the smaller size (size of the pocket, not just quantity).  It works for what I need to give my cat, but may not work for some pills, so I advise buyers to pay attention to this."
excellent sugar substitute,"Sweet `N Low is my favorite sugar substitute. I like the sweet taste of my coffee with two packets of this mixed in; and I suppose you could use this for recipes as well.<br /><br />Sweet `N Low contains no calories, no fat and no sodium. It has less than 1 gram of sugar which means it has practically no sugar. It has less than 1 gram of carbs which again makes this product a good choice for people who can't use sugar in their diets.<br /><br />Use this product before and expiration date stamped on the outside of the package. You can either keep the individual packets in the thin cardboard box that they come in or you can put a few in a container and leave them on your kitchen counter or your dining room table.<br /><br />Overall, Sweet `N Low may be too sweet for some people; in that case try Splenda or Equal. I personally like a slightly sweeter taste to my coffee or iced tea and therefore I chose Sweet `N Low as my favorite."
NICE EXTRA FOR THE PARTY!,"I USED THIS AS A ""PROP"" AT MY MOTHER'S 68TH BIRTHDAY PARTY.  IT ADDED A NICE TOUCH TO THE TABLE.  THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF CANDY IN THE BOX, AND I THINK IT BROUGHT A LOT OF NOSTALGIA TO THE OCCASION."
"The""Real McCoy""","If you want a quality tea that is the daily choice of the Irish, this is for you.  It is bold. Drink like the Irish do with sugar and milk.  I got so used to my daily ""fix"" while working in Dublin for a month that I was delighted to find it online when I had depleted the supply brought back with me."
Perfect Size for Little Mouths!,"I'm writing this Natural Balance dog food review for my Mom because she raves about Ultra small breed bites and wanted to share her opinion.  Her little Yorkie Patches wouldn't eat any other small bites natural food except this one.  The ingredients are great, chicken is the first on the list, and it is a very affordable and healthy dog food.  My whole family buys this brand and has for years, we love their dog and cat foods!"
BeetleJuice,This is one of the best dark comedies ever!  If you haven't seen this yet...you need to.  Watch it with friends and family.  You will be hooked!!
Yummy!!!!,I always like to keep a box of energy bar in the office. I tried many different brands and larabar is one of the brands I like best. Once I feel like snacking or munching on something I go a grab a energy bar. The taste of this energy is great. The best thing about it is that it's much healthier then lot of the other energy bars.
"Yummy, but a little high in fat.","Yes, these are very good, but they tend to be a little high in calories and fat.  I try to eat just half a cookie at a time.  Usually once a day."
This is great,This is a great product the preparation is easy the taste is great and the Amazon terms make it a solid winner.
better than brothu,"Rate this stock five star , I u this and chicken stock with confidence.  Don't forget, shake wellbefore using because it's a little more  heavy than broth. I use unstead of wine in SOME sauces to deglaze.p"
Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."
Highest Quality,"Gemlik olives of course are the best tasting.  The package was excellent, the harvest varies in size from year to year these were a bit small, but still the best.  I will probably order again soon possibly after the December harvest. I have lived near Gemlik (between Gemlik and Kumla) and the taste brings back fond memories."
Yup - works really well for us!,"One of my cats is very prone to getting hairballs (once or twice a day), AND sensitive to a bunch of foods, that make him throw up. Since switching to this food (in addition to weruva canned food, which they've been getting for a couple of years), I see a hairball from him maybe once a month, and very rare vomiting. I almost feel bad, because I don't really bother grooming him much anymore, as the need is less apparent. I suspect he doesn't mind..."
does not meet quantity as advertised,This ad is for a box of 48 bars.  I recieved a box of 30 but charged the price of $19 and change.
"Good idea, but needs some work","This is a great idea, but i find that the grounds get into the coffee, and the coffee doesn't come out of the maker as nice as the regular kcups.  It is messy as it comes out and misses the mug.  It still is nice but is not quite as good as the orginal."
Good & healthy,"I mix 2 or 3 small scoops with about a cup of vanilla yogurt, a small handful of dried cranberries and the same of slivered almonds, when I'm on my way into the shower, and by the time I'm ready for breakfast, the meusli has absorbed a lot of the moisture from the yogurt & become easier to chew & digest. Very good!"
Actually tasty!,I recommend using half water and half skim milk. I usually mix 5 oz water with 5 oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes.  Add the packet and sugar or sweetener.  Great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine.
The chip with a kiss of salt,"These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet. I didn't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack. These chips are bursting with flavor, and you can't really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!!"
TAZO TEA review  4 stars,"It was fine, but took much longer than it should.Amazon should/could do better with deliveries. Try to do better. I seems I have to write a few more words, Now that is a waste of time."
My new Favorite Hot Sauce,Discovered this Hot Sauce on a recent trip to Hawaii and while eating it I had to extend the experience.  Literally ordered it from my phone as I enjoyed.  It has an awesome flavor with just the right amount of Spice.  You can taste the quality ingredients...very highly recommended!
Yummi Gummi,"Ordered these for my daughter's baby shower.  She's having a boy and I gave him the nickname, Gummi Bear because of his sonogram picture.  They were deliciously perfect."
a healthy addiction,"Try these in your morning coffee and start the day off right.  I cant fond them at my local stores anymore do now I have to order them online .. extra step, but totally worth it .. try it once, and it will become your new morning routine .."
Excellent - Gone in Days!,I got these for my husband who is a gummi fanatic. They are very tough and chewy and do have an unusual flavor (think: sour chewing gum flavors)but overall we were extremely satisfied.
good deal,"My store, Food 4 Less, only sells the reason, which is good, but I love the reg. brown bread, so finding this  was wonderful. I keep a few in my long term food storage as well since they have a good shelf life,"
Great stuffings,Never made sausage before and had no idea what to expect when ordering this product. I found it to be easy to use and rather fun to make my own sausausages. I would say there is pleanty of casings to make 25lbs. of sausage with no problem.
great product,I used nicorette to quit smoking and I used gum to quit nicorette...regular gum has a bunch of things I can't pronounce in the name that gave me headaches (because I chew a lot) so I had to go to a natural gum with no sugar (sugar is bad) :)....this gum is great and all natural...not sure if Xylitol really does help your teeth or not...but as a far as natural sugar free gum goes this does trick...highly recommended....
~*~*~NO MORE URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS~*~*~,"My cat is 10 years old and he used to get UTI's ALL the time(like every few months) not only was his vet bills expensive, I hated that he was in pain. I used the very expensive food I bought from the vet for cats who get lots of UTI's but since I am not Donald Trump I decided to give the Purina One Urinary Tract food a try. For years my cat didn't have a single UTI so one day at the store when they were out of the Purina One, I decided to give a cheaper Urinary Tract cat food a try. Within a month my cat was whining in the litter box and I knew he had another UTI. I took him to the Vet and sure enough, he had another UTI.<br /><br />I immediately went to the store and bought him Purina One Urinary Tract and that is what he has been on ever since. I will NEVER again try a different brand of cat food, that was over 4 years ago since I tried the cheaper cat food and he hasn't had a single UTI since. My cat LOVES his food, he is very picky but thankfully he loves his UTI formula.<br /><br />If you have a cat who gets UTI's I totally recommend giving this food a try. It costs more than the cheaper food but what it saves me in vet bills and having a happy & healthy Kitty is well worth it : )"
A mainstay in my house for my buddy Odin,"My dog can chew!  I'm surprised at the work he can do on this thing.  First of all it's HARD, almost impossibly so.  The one issue I have is that it becomes a landmine for your feet in the dark.  My dog likes to leave them around after he's done chewing and sweet lord it hurts when you step on them.  I now shuffle around in the dark to avoid the pain.  He enjoys chewing on them and I make sure to throw them away when they get too short.  Buy 2 or 3 and change them up so the dog does not get bored with one."
My favorite chocolates....except they are melted when I got it,"I love chocolate filled with liquor and the Mon Cheri itself does not disappoint. It is the seller and the problematic packaging that gives me the urge to rate it 2 stars. Yes it wasn't FULLY melted when I got them, but the whole thing looks like its been stored somewhere in the desert in Nevada for three days before shipped to me. Yes it came with an ice pack that was supposed to keep it cool, except that the ice pack itself is like a balloon filled with warm water.<br /><br />So apparently, I will not buy from this seller again."
Not just a wonderful snack,Today I ate a bag of pork skins for lunch and the pecan pie was an excellent dessert after this delicious meal.  I have enjoyed these pecan pies for years and they only keep getting better.  The gooey filling is nicely contrasted to any fried food that my family likes.<br /><br />It is recommended to place the pie on the dashboard of your truck for 60-90 minutes prior to eating.  The heat from the sun really warms up the goo/pecan mixture.<br /><br />Don't try to eat the pie while talking on your CB.  I got goo all in my mic and had to order another one for $45 and then pay $50 to get it tuned.<br /><br />Be sure to save the pie tins.  I take mine home to the old lady to wash.  I have some nailed to my mail box pole and they serve as great reflectors.  I also use them to store screws/bolts/nails etc. on my work bench.  My old lady once made a mobile out of them and put over Bobby's crib when he was a baby.  They make great ash trays and they can also be hung from trees to keep the deer out of your yard/garden.
"Pricey, but well worth it","There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.  I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.<br /><br />The Wellness food, labeled ""Core,"" is very low carb and both my cats love it!  It contains a lot of water (""no more than 78%"" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.<br /><br />As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too.  She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.<br /><br />I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic.  The Wellness canned food is fantastic and might save your kitty's life!"
good chocolate fix,I really enjoy this added to coffee for a mocha flavor.  Dissolves better than other fat free hot chocolate mixes.
Delicious.,"Wow, I'm impressed. These are delicious. They cure your carb cravings and are much better for you than traditional carb-binging snacks!"
Absolutely Disgusting,"I like the other reviewer bought this from World Market, and it is DISGUSTING. I chucked it and the other boxes I had bought straight in the trash."
Great cup of cocoa,I like the rich dark smooth taste of the Grove Square cocoa. It is the best I have found in K-cups and I have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now. Delicious!
Amazing!,"I expected these to taste good, but I was surprised - They are absolutely amazing. Perfect for watching TV on a cool evening, and low-calorie (not that you can taste it), so no guilt!"
False advertising - Misleading,"The Amazon.com page for this items states ""Item count says 100 and a shipping weight says 6 pounds"".  The picture shows a box of pig ears. I ordered and recieved ""1"" pig ear with shipping cost almost $7.00.  Complete rip off!  This is false advertising at its worse and now they want to charge me shipping to return my $7.00 pig ear.  I will be filing a complaint with BBB to protect others on Amazon.com from being ripped off like this."
"Bye-Bye, my local coffee shop...","My sister turned me on to this protein drink two weekends ago. I am an excessive coffee-drinker. It's my vice. I love espresso drinks and coffee. And spend far too much $ at my local coffee shop I have frequented for 10 years. Usually the first thing in the a.m. on my list is to brew a pot of coffee and mix a soy protein shake from GNC. But not here lately. Now first thing I do after my feet hit the floor is to pour 10 oz of milk into the handy shaker and mix 2 scoops of Click, shake it up and voila. It's delicious! (Did I mention I no longer brew coffee in the a.m.?)<br />Another important factor for me is that I don't eat meat. I am a Pescetarian. So, as a rule, I don't get enough protein in my diet. That's probably one of the reasons I drink so much coffee, is because my energy wanes during the day. I used to get a stomach ache daily that I just sort of got used to - was it too much coffee on an empty stomach or the soy in the protein shake from GNC?? Who knows.<br />What I do know is that today, for example, I drank two Click shakes back to back with my supplements I take every a.m. (Omega 3, multi, Acai, B complex...) and I feel great. No stomach ache, no jitters, energetic and content.<br />I would highly recommend this product. I've just ordered two more canisters! Enjoy!"
Wonderful chips,These are some premium tasting chips...as soon as you open the bag you can tell these ain't your regular chip...and it is amazing that these are low fat..they sure taste like fully loaded chips. Get em on sale..these chips are worth $2 a bag..
Best pasta for baked dishes,"Extremely good pasta--high-quality, cooks up nicely al dente, absorbs the perfect amount of salt from generously salted water. This shape is perfect, in my experience, for baked pasta dishes and all varieties of macaroni and cheese."
YUMMY AND FRESH,"Definitely would order again.  Each time I get it, it is fresh.  If you like licorice, you will like this mix."
yummy but this is overpriced,"i'm from new england and grew up drinking this since i was a kid. i moved to CA and they don't sell it here. i ran out of the ones my parents mailed me, and saw you could buy it on here. but WHAT is that price? who would pay over $20 for a bottle you can buy for about $3 or $4 in the grocery store? LOL. i'll just ask my parents to mail me some more. you should do the same."
So-so cereal,"I was thrilled to learn that General Mills began offering gluten-free rice chex and corn Chex a while back.  And being a chocolate lover, when they also made Chocolate Chex gluten-free, I could not wait to try it.  It was quite a disappointment.  To me at least, the chocolate flavor seemed to be just that - flavor - not what actually tastes like real chocolate.  It's not awful, and I won't have a problem eating the whole case of 6 boxes, but it'll be just a bit at a time until all the boxes are gone.  I don't anticipate purchasing more of it.  I truly wanted this to be a 5-star product - it just isn't."
Great masala chai!,"I love this tea even though I can get all the ingredients from India and make my own masala chai. But this one has a special flavor and is organic! However, it is a little weak and does not give the full bodied tea experience of true Indian chai. So I mix strong black tea from India. Then boil some ginger before adding the tea in the water. Also, milk should always be added after the tea has boiled for a minute or so. When it all comes to the boil for the last time, add sugar/honey and strain. Boiling the tea without milk will give you more color and taste, otherwise it becomes too weak and milky."
INCREDIBLE TASTE,"This is the best product Blue Diamond sells, at least in my book. Spicy bbq flavor, like eating chips, but a much healthier alternative. You will not be sorry for buying these. I order these all the time, great deal on 3 pkg of 1 lb bags. YUM  PS:I am on atkins in the maintenance mode and miss chips, this is the replacement I was looking for: Far less carbs."
Variable strength from pod to pod,Flavor varied from pod to pod.  Most cups that I made were fine.  Some were weak and barely above dark colored hot water.
Good stuff,To those crying about this product. If you wanted equal you should of spent the money and bought equal. Not a thing wrong with this product!
Love them!,"I love these! My dogs will not go to bed without one! It is their ""night cookie"" and I feel good about giving them something healthy for a treat. They are also a good value. MY BABIES RATE THEM A FIVE STAR!"
Great chilis,I will order again from this company when I need more.  Everything was as stated.  Good product.  Makes great sause.
My Kids Devour These Cookies,"""Oreos"" are America's favorite cookie. Frankly, I've never understood the fascination. But my kids sure do! They devour these cookies. I have tried them myself, and they are very similar to the gluten-containing version. But the important thing is that my kids love them and don't have to feel like they are missing out on a vital part of American childhood!"
One of my favorites!,"This coffee is amazing. I've tried multiple coffees and each time I come back to this one. It is strong... but not bitter. You will not be disappointed, buy it today!"
Made me VERY sick,"I have used other brands of Maca with no problem.  This one made me very, very sick to my stomach with pain and nausea.  It took me a few weeks to isolate what was making me sick - had a full gastro work-up and everything - that's how sick I was!  Today, after being healthy again for 2 months I tried 1/2 tsp of maca to test and am sick and nauseous.<br /><br />I know many people take maca with no problems.  I only post this so those who get sick will hopefully not struggle as long as I did to figure out what is causing it."
Freakin' Awesome.,"The tea is excellent.  I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as Numi's ""Smoky Tarry"", but it came through, colors flying.  It kind of smells like your in a leather shop where someone's cooking bacon while smoking a pipe, but the taste is surprisingly smooth.  It could be drank alone by itself, but it is strong enough to add milk, if you should so choose.  I couldn't imagine it with sugar in it.  That might be disgusting.  Actually, it probably would be.  Don't put sugar in it.  Some teas were meant to be unsweetened.  Another thing worth mentioning, the flavor comes from the smoking of the leaves over bamboo slats, so after you've used the bag once, you can't really use it again, like with some stronger breakfast teas.  Overall, one of the best teas for just about any time of the day except bedtime.  Serve HOT.<br /><br />\m>_&lt;\m/"
Trouble Sleeping? Neuro Sleep is the answer.,"I first tried the Neuro drinks from a local gas station. Bliss was the first one I tried, and it was amazing how well it actually worked (but that's for another review); so, based on that knowledge, I was more than happy to try Neuro Sleep.<br /><br />I've always had trouble getting to sleep. I will go to bed and lie awake for over half an hour every night. Not necessarily enough to be considered an insomniac, but certainly annoying. I'd always tried to find a fix. Tylenol PM, warm milk, etc. Nothing ever got me to sleep any quicker. Until now.<br /><br />Neuro Sleep is something you drink about 20 or 30 minutes before bedtime. It tastes great (has kind of an orange-y taste to it), and isn't carbonated so it goes down quick if you want it to or are thirsty. Within a few minutes, you begin to feel a little drowsy. By about 20 minutes, you're ready for bed (assuming, of course, this is a normal bedtime; if you drink it in the middle of the day, I don't expect it would put you to sleep like this). It lets me get to sleep right when I want to.<br /><br />All my friends always tell me the Neuro drinks are just placebo effect kinds of things, and they're not really doing anything. Well, I did some research, and Neuro Sleep is armed with 3mg of melatonin, which is a chemical naturally produced by the (normal) body to help put you to sleep. So this one, at least, really does work.<br /><br />I recommend trying it out from a gas station before laying down the money for a case, but hey, I eventually caved in and got myself a case, so maybe you will too."
Delicious!,Delicious popcorn! Anyone who likes popcorn will love Hawaiian Hurricane Popcorn. I just wish they sold this in stores on the mainland.
My Cats Love These,"These treats are a daily ritual between me and my cats, they really love them.  The product arrives quickly, appears fresh and well packaged, and is priced reasonably - a good deal overall."
Wonderful,Bought this for a birthday party to make cotton candy and before I knew it all the cotton candy was gone. I kept getting asked to make more from both kids and adults. It tastes just like the cotton candy from a carnival or circus. It tastes and smells delicious.
A must for dogs!,"My two dogs love this product , and it is all organic .All of Newman's dog foods are good for your dog .Give them a try .Keep them in good health ."
Interesting idea... so-so execution,"I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future."
Love it!,This is my absolute favorite tea. It's very minty but not overwhelming. Good price since it's a big bag. It came packaged very nicely too.
"tully,s french roast k-cup coffee","Love this coffee it is full bodied and just the right flavor. I drink alot of coffee and this one is a keeper. Smells great brewing and keeps it flavor, just the right amount of boldness."
"Good cup of ""fake"" cappuccino, just know what you're buying","Yes, this has instant coffee in it and is ready to drink. If you have ever gotten one of those instant cappuccino drinks from a gas station you pretty much know what this is going to taste like. (you know, the one you have to hold the button and make sure you release in enough time so your drink doesn't overflow!) I enjoy it for what it is, because sometimes I just have a craving for those cheap cappuccino drinks. A few things to note:<br /><br />- Make sure you don't brew more than 8 ounces with one cup, it will be diluted. The stuff is powder mix, it doesn't brew like regular coffee grounds<br />- Please pay attention to ingredients if you are health-conscious (See below for nutrition info & ingredients)<br />- It can leave residue in your keurig/brewer so try to run a round of hot water right after brewing<br />- The box indicates that each serving contains 20-30mg caffeine<br /><br />Nutrition Info for 1 cup:<br />80 calories, 4.5 grams fat (all saturated), 170mg sodium (7%), 9g carbs (5g sugar), 0g protein<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, corn syrup solids, instant coffee, sodium caseinate, salt, cocoa, natural & artificial flavors, dipotassium phosphate, cornstarch, mono- & diglycerides, solicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color, sucralose"
King Crab Legs,"First thing is I did not purchase crab legs from Omaha as the price  is 10 steps beyond gouging. Here in the NY area they can be purchased for $7.99 a pound, no S&H. There are 2 sizes of legs, larger and smaller [usually referred to as A's & B's] with the larger being approximately $2.00 a pound more.<br /><br />Considering that there's more shell weight than meat weight, $25 a pound is completely outrageous.<br /><br />Look elsewhere for your crab legs. I hope Amazon takes note of this review."
So good I wanted to write a review,"I bought these after finding them in the health food section. SOOO tasty and unbelievably flavorful... I've been buying them plenty of times.<br /><br />Pros: Delicious!!!<br /><br />Cons: The instructions are wrong on the cup, and correct on the outer paper. My fianc&eacute; burnt his by cooking the extra minute which is how we discovered this error.<br /><br />Cooking in the microwave for 1.5 minutes after stirring, and 4 more minutes makes it perfect! So good - I'm eating one right now!"
Great GFCF Snack,"My 9yo has been GFCF from birth due to food allergies. He loves Tings and we all eat them. I'm only disappointed that Amazon has been unable to get the 2oz bags in stock for several months. We prefer the smaller bags for convenience, but we'll take the larger ones when they are the only ones available."
The best all around hot sauce there is.,I've tried many hot sauces and the one I always go back to is this one. It actually accents the flavor of any food instead of burden it. I've tried Louisiana hot sauces and they are to vinegary for most lighter food but this doesn't taste of vinegar it has more of a garlicky taste. so it doesn't overpower anything.<br />I do have other sauces I like for certain foods but this one I love on everything.
The best sauce in a jar!,"Our family is positively addicted to Don Pomodoro Puttanesca Sauce.  It is worth every penny!!  The ingredients are of a very high quality, you can taste the individual ingredients, and the best word to describe it is ""Bright""!  My husband does not like green olives but he loves this sauce."
I've been eating it for years!,"If you truly enjoy old-fashioned, hard, tear your teeth out jerky, this is awesome stuff.  Found it by chance while living in Seattle and fell in love with it.  This peppered taste variety is hard to find nowadays, but I'm glad I found it on amazon.  Price is good for the quantity in the bag too.<br /><br />Now that I live in Florida I can't even get Oberto Jerky in the hard variety.  Just the soft stuff (which is good too, I just like variety!)<br /><br />Wish Oberto would bring it back...I'll eat it forever...very addicting!"
Delish!,"I'm in love with this! I love it on my frozen yogurt even had it on ice cream when the yogurt was gone LOL I'm not a ""fresh"" yogurt person but it would be good mixed with the fruit too.<br /><br />Just a hint of cinnamon but just right IMO Lots of flax seed so was crunchy enough too.<br /><br />I recommend this!"
Best Yet!,This is my favorite Larabar.<br />The lime and coconut give it a lightness to balance the richer flavors.
Almost 2x cost of costco,"At this price this is not a deal, being almost twice the cost of the same item at costco.  But it is still a nice cookie..."
Peanut butter with only a quarter of the calories!,"This stuff is like peanut butter-flavored crack.  You can control how thick or thin you make it, so it's just as perfect to pack in sandwiches without ending up with a gooey mess by noon as it is to drizzle over ice cream.  I usually mix the cocoa flavor with a little chocolate soymilk and eat it right out of the bowl for an indulgent-tasting afternoon snack."
I subscribe because I like it,"I love this stuff and it is hard to find.  So I subscribed, and now I get it every couple months.  It tastes great and subscribing ensures I never run out."
Wow!,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
Not Impressed,"I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star reviews. This tiny little packet was way over priced and the vendor charged way too much for shipping. They charged $5.98 for shipping an item that they probably could have sent with a single first class postage stamp affixed.<br /><br />I agree with those individuals who said these tablets taste funny and are definitely not sweet.  After dissolving the tablet, the quarter slice of lemon that I bit into was only slightly sweet... MY son said it tasted like lemonade. It did sort of taste like lemonade - more sour than sweet.  After that the effect pretty much was unnoticeable. I tried it again tonight with some raspberries and sour cherries. I tasted no difference, other than that of the strange lingering after-taste that the tablet leaves behind.<br /><br />Another person mentioned having tasted tea after dissolving a tablet on the tongue. Like that person, I did notice a difference but did not really care for the taste. More like an artificial sweetener than like sugar. My son and I were very disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />[...]"
So Good!!,I like to pop them in the microwave for a few seconds and eat them when they are warm. They taste like homemade!
The best so far!,I hate protein shakes but I love this drink! The flavor is great and the caffeine is a total plus. The texture and thickness is like milk and it tastes great hot! You won't regret this purchase.
Vacation Treats,"My cat does soft treats only, so these are great for him.  It's nice that I can buy them in bulk and get them delivered to the door two day shipping for free with my prime membership.  I'm not sure he really cares which flavor, but I like the idea of ""Caribbean Catch Tuna""... it makes me feel like he gets a little vacation in every bite."
Yummy!,I love this dressing...it's portability being the biggest selling point for me.  I wish all dressings were available in single serve packs.  The taste is wonderful for a totally fat free dressing.  There's nothing else on the market to compare.  I eat out and travel a good bit so this fits right in with my lifestyle.
A big WOW for there Atomic Fireballs,These are by far the BEST Atomic fireballs I've ever had.  They are definitely hot and spicy cinnamon that stays a long time. The price was great and the product is fantastic!!! I highly recommend and will be a return customer whenever my candy jar starts to run low.
Great PB Alternative,"I've gone through 2 bags so far and I must say both my Husband and I enjoy this Low calorie alternative. Now we both are fitness nuts and we still use regular spreadable peanut butter. Just for our shakes the peanut butter was just to high in fat and calories.<br /><br />Here are the Nutritional Value's<br /><br />PB2: Powdered Peanut Butter<br />Ingredients: Roasted peanuts, sugar and salt.<br />Serving size: 2 Tablespoons (12 grams)<br />Servings per container: 15<br />Calories: 45<br />Calories from fat: 13<br />Total fat 1.5 g  3%<br />Saturated fat 0 g  0%<br />Trans fat &lt; 0.01 g<br />Cholesterol &lt; 0.01 mg  0%<br />Sodium 94 mg  4%<br />Total carbohydrate 5 g  2%<br />Dietary fiber 2 g  8%<br />Sugars 1 g<br />Protein 5 g<br />Vitamin A &lt; 1%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium &lt;1%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />This product compared to Jiff ""Our fav.

My daughter loved these from 7 months until 2 years old,"These treats were perfect for my little one. She started on them at about 7 months and they were great for a quick snack anywhere. I always carried them wherever we went. I would recommend them to anyone. They are quite plain nutritionally speaking, but so much better than sugary or salty snacks."
Thank God!! Great coffee again!!,I've been hungering for this coffee since Burger King stopped selling it a couple of years ago -- I havn't back there since they changed to the current mud they serve.  Thankfully I found this coffee available after reading a web site about it.  For the first time in two years I can finally look forward to getting up in the morning and facing the day -- with GREAT coffee!
AWESOME!!!,"GREAT TASTE!!! PUT A LITTLE LIGHT OLIVE OIL AND SEA SALT ON IT, YUMMY!!! GREAT PRICE TOO! WOULD TOTALLY AND DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!"
If you like hot chocolate you will LOVE this!,I have tried hundreds of hot chocolates from the really expensive and really cheap and this is by far the best you can ever have. It is creamy and the wonderful taste of Butterfingers. It is like a candy bar in a mug. However it is not overpowering.<br /><br />If you want to try something delicious this is perfect.
Great Product,I will order more. Love the taste and quality of this product. Recommended for all ages. All Haribo products are great.
really good tea,My daughter and I are really enjoying this tea.  It has that great Keemun flavor without the exorbitant price of our local tea shop.  Highly recommended!
Ginseng tea,Love the tea hate the price as back in the day I paid $3.99 for 100 bags. 1/4 of what I pay now.
love 'em!,"I am always looking for a snack that is low in sugar and organic, these are perfect.  I love them as much as my 2yo."
Excellent beef stick,"I haven't eaten other Jack's products, but this one is great - bought on impulse, which I seldom do.  Kind of wish I wouldn't have as I can see these becoming a craved addiction.  As other's have said, they're a little spicy, but certainly not hot.  As a grease-o-phobe, I didn't find them greasy at all."
cupcake toppers,Cute product and went nicely for my bumblebee<br />cupcakes. Toppers were easy to chew as well and<br />not hard as a rock
Great peanuts with the perfect level of salt,"This is a six-pack of fairly tall cans of salted peanuts.  I find the level of salt on these perfect - not too much, but not too little either.  Planters also does a good job of keeping out the sins and shells.  Arrives in a shrink wrap six-pack and each can is vacum sealed."
great asthma reliever,"I purchased this product recently for my teenaged son's recurring asthma--imagine my delight and relief with finally finding something herbal that not only works but works rapidly!  This tea is quick and easy to prepare, relieves chest constriction, opens up the airways, and clears up my son's wheezing. Thank you, Traditional Medicinals, for keeping us out of the doctor's office and steroid free!"
missing contents due to poor packaging,"I ordered two dozens of Stacy's pita chips, which came in two separate boxes.  Both boxes were open and some of the contents were missing.  I have no way of telling who's to blame for the missing contents, however, I would think that the company could have used a more secure packaging instead of the easy-tear boxes.  It would also have been better to either double box the items or use a plain brown box to discourage stealing while items are being delivered."
Delicious,I love this tea and local stores in and around my area stopped carrying it. Thank goodness for amazon.  It is much cheaper through amazon as well.
7 weeks from expiration date out of 12 MONTH time frame,"I called the Customer Service line to gain an understanding of the cryptic manufacturer date stamp.  M&ms are rated safe for 12 months from  manufacturing date.  The first three digits of my product code are 132.  This was explained as 2011 - 3rd week - 2nd day.  We have about 7 weeks left out of a whole year for safe consumption.<br /><br />Having purchased three giant CHRISTMAS bags expecting to have about 6 months of m&ms, we are very disappointed.<br /><br />7 weeks left out of 52 weeks.  Of course, this means that Mars manufactured these Christmas m&ms last January for the following December which already limited their freshness time after Christmas.  SEEMS LIKE A DUMB CHOICE TO US.  Thought you ought to know."
not bad,"this candy is made with 100% wisconsin american ginseng.  sugar and glucose are the first two ingredients, so you can expect it to be sweet.  as you suck on the candy and it dissolves, there are pieces of ginseng imbedded in the candy.  20 calories, and carbs 2%.  there's around 25 round pieces of candy in the tin, lightly powdered white sugar on them.  it does have a ginseng flavor, but not real strong or rooty.  not bad, inexpensive candy in a round tin.  i'll probably buy more once this runs out."
Great snackin',"I only tried this cereal because some of my standard cereals are now charging an arm and a leg! I was quite pleased with it. In fact, I don't even use it as a breakfast cereal, but for snackin' when I want something crunchy , not too sweet, and not too caloric. I would recommend it."
halo treats for cats,"the treats were simply fantastic, Fur & LuLu have just about eaten them all up.  They need some more, they have only one left, down to using the powder.  Thank you, much."
1 smoking BBQ sauce,This is probably one of the best BBQ sauces that I have had. It has bold flavor and a bit spicy but the heat goes away quickly.
Best freaking lemon tea ever! Bam!,"This one will put a pucker on your lips and a smile in your heart.  I have found a new tea to love, especially if it is iced tea.  I do not use any sweeteners and none is needed.  The tastes and aroma is outstanding.  This has to be the best Stash tea I have tried.  I will keep coming back for it as long as they sell it.  If you like lemon, you will love this tea."
ALL DOGS LOVE THIS PRODUCT,I was given these as a gift from my friend who shows and breeds Standard Poodles.  She said they are a healthy chew bone choice as they are made out of natural ingrediants.  She was right. My dogs loved them so much that I purchase them regularly.  These are greate for smaller dogs.  I have all sizes of dogs so I have also purchased the larger size Himalayan Dog Chews and all the dogs love them.  I've given them as gifts and gotten rave reviews back from the guardians of the dogs.  I would highly recommend this product.
DONT BE FOOLED THESE ARE MADE IN CHINA,Stay away -- these are made in China!!!  Dogs have been dying of liver problems linked to chicken treats made in China.
A Well Scented Tea,"The sign of a good Earl Grey tea is the use of real oil of bergamot, not just flavoring. Bergamot is a yellow citrus fruit, in the orange family, native to southern Italy. The fruit is considered inedible, however the oil extracted from the skin has been the foundation of the cologne industry for many, many years. Higgins & Burke Earl Grey is provided in individual, foil-wrapped tea bags. Open a pouch and you are immediately aware of the distinct aroma of bergamot.<br />Higgins & Burke chose asian black tea as the base for their Earl Grey. Unfortunately, the tea is almost dust and somewhat weak.<br />If you allow it to steep long enough, you can end up with a drinkable cup of Earl Grey. If they had chosen a better tea base, the beverage could be better."
One of Caribbean's Best,"Bring back some of the spice and sunshine of the Caribbean, its possible with Baron West Indian Hot Sauce. Add a touch of the tropics to every meal."
Great Aroma; Mild Taste,"Marley Coffee comes with no directions on the package, only the statement that it's single serving. It doesn't state what system of coffee brewing this was manufactured for.  The aroma is wonderful, however, I'd describe the coffee as mild not medium roast.  I was, therefore, disappointed in the flavor. Perhaps if it was brewed in a cone system or similar, I might have had a stronger result."
Take caution -- these are delicious!,"I think I could eat myself to death with these. One is NEVER enough for me. They are soooooooooo yummy! I love almost all of the Kind bar selections, but these are my favorite because for 150 calories--you really feel like your eating something much more sinful (even though you're not!). They're good for you too (all the right fats for beautiful skin) and it's just a perfect guilt-free treat."
Dog loves it!,"An excellent product, and of course, my dogs loves it.  It seems to last a long time, as she has just started to wear down the edges after constant chewing.  Not messy and has no odd odor.  Does not stain her hair or whatever she happens to chew it on.  A bit pricey, but since it seems to last a very long time for her, I will purchase again."
Can't Do Without It,"I love this coconut oil.  It is the best makeup remover ever!  Yes, it even removes the waterproof mascara.  It is great for internal and external use.  I can't do without it!"
it is so hot,"me and my girlfriend throw these at cars and it makes us horny, doing this from a helicopter! is a lot of fun"
"Dogs like this, but ...","My two Golden Retrievers like these a lot, but they are expensive and they disappear very quickly.  I prefer chews that last longer."
Why do their organic foods contain gelatin???,I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.  I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic.
Good way to sample,"This sampler had a LOT of espresso pods to test.  I really enjoyed the experience, and it helped me to decide which pod to order by the box.  Frankly, none were bad."
"Dry, old beans","I gave this coffee beans several months to improve; however, the beans arrived in the same condition. The beans were dry without a speck of oil. Usually freshly roasted beans are wet with oil. I understand the summer has been very hot and that could dry the beans out a little, but these beans have apparently been sitting in the warehouse a long time. The flavor suffered. I'm no longer receiving these beans. The fresher the roast, the better the coffee tastes."
We poured ours out,"Google ""propylene glycol"" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's ""pure"" and then there's ""not so much"".....<br /><br />from the website:  [...]<br /><br />Propylene Glycol<br /><br />A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.<br />Also used in:<br /><br />  Tyre sealant<br />  Rubber cleaner<br />  De-icer<br />  Stain removers<br />  Fabric softener<br />  Degreaser<br />  Paint<br />  Adhesive<br />  Wallpaper stripper<br /><br />I wrote the company about this concern and they never responded...."
Love Zesty Italian,"Good Seasons Zesty Italian is wonderful. People rave about my salads and I always use Good Seasons Zesty Italian. I use apple cider vinegar and saffola oil. I've tried using olive oil but it doesn't have quite the good taste that the saffola oil has. For spinach salad I put in bacon, lots of green onion, mushrooms, avacado, lots of parmesan cheese, hard boiled eggs and croutons. I love this dressing."
Yummy.,These taste great.  It was 100 degrees when these were delivered so they were a little sticky.  A few minutes in the fridge and they were fantastic.
Tea Leaves Everywhere!,3/4 of the leaves had fallen out of the tea bag and were sitting in the paper envelope; consider this a loose tea (not bagged) and remember to have a strainer handy!
MY CAT LOVES IT!,"My cat, I suppose like a lot of cats, is a very picky eater!  She loves the Felidae dry cat food but only the chicken, turkey, lamb & fish formula.  She doesn't seem to like small round hard nugget pieces of dry food.  This formula is in a tiny flat bone shape and seems softer for her to chew.  The whole grain formula is smaller hard round nuggets, so she doesn't like them, but other cats may like it.  I feel it is a healthy cat food for her and since she has been eating it for awhile now, she doesn't have the fur balls so much like she used to.  I am thankful it is sold on Amazon as it is hard to find and I hope they are able to keep on selling it!  The shipment from this seller was delivered fast, which is helpful when you forget to order it soon enough.  A very satisfied customer and cat!"
"Great, refreshing green tea w/hint of lemon","Don't order this if you are expecting it to taste like an everyday, standard green tea.  Do order this if you like green tea and want a refreshing tea drink.  With the addition of lemongrass, lemon balm, and verbena leaves, this is a fabulous step up from your run-of-the-mill green tea.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with lemongrass, lemon balm, or verbena, think of a light spritz of citrus.  Just something to lighten your green tea.  It's perfect for something warm before bedtime or (my favorite!) chilled to have as iced tea.<br /><br />To make the iced tea, use two teabags to 8 cups of boiling water.  Let steep based on desired strength of tea.  Remove tea bags and let liquid come down to room temperature.  Once the temp. has lowered, pop your pitcher of tea in the fridge.  Let chill.  Pour. Yum!"
Kyjen Dog Games Treat Wheel (Misc.),I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup
ingredients should be listed,"I was disappointed to see that this product contains Sucralose.  It also contains sugar so why the need for an artificial sweetener too?  I now have 54 kcups of a product that I really don't care to put in my body.<br />Some people are sensitive to artificial sweeteners, like my daughter who immediately went to the bathroom after drinking a cup, so the should definitely be listed."
better digestion,"my tabby cat loves the fish cat chews, and I feel that it helps her digestion because her elimination has been much better since she started eating them."
Best unsalted chips,These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.  They came when you said they would.
I order more of this than any other coffee. Ordering more today!,"I love Tully's House Blend K-Cups! I have several dozen other flavors and always find myself reaching for Tully's House Blend. It is just right when I wake up in the morning and throughout the day. Strong, bold, but not strong enough to make me so hyper that people run from me! I'm about to order more right now and thought I would stop and make a review while I'm thinking about it."
Very Crunchy...but too sweet.,I must say I do love a truly crunchy cereal. But this cereal was way too sweet. If Kellogg's cut the sugar in half they would have a winner on their hands.
"Hot Enough to be ""The Source"" of the Big Bang!!!","I just started ""officially"" collecting hot sauces / extracts this year...2010. Although I just started collecting as a ""hobby"", I've been a fan of hot foods for decades. Plus, I've grown many different peppers including but not limited to jalape&ntilde;o, Cayenne, and Haba&ntilde;ero.<br /><br />I thought I knew ""hot""...until I tried ""The Source Collectors Extract"". This extract is rated at a nuclear 7,100,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)!! I've tried it both as a food additive and directly on my tongue (DO NOT TRY THE LATTER). This stuff is the hottest of ANY sauce / extract I've ever had...and I've had a lot. There has been a few close seconds but they just didn't quite have the same peak heat or staying power. ""The Source"" is hot instantly and you think, ""WOW, this IS HOT"", but then it creeps up on you even more until your reaching for some milk...ice cream...water...anything to make it stop!!!<br /><br />This is my personal favorite and I highly recommend ""The Source"" to anyone who is a true hot pepper enthusiast.<br /><br />Five Stars!!!"
Great flavor,"It's got the same great molasses flavor I remember from the old days, other Carmel corns don't taste that way. It would be better yet if it had more peanuts, but I just add some of my own. Also the expiration date seems to be a very short time before it's expired. It never is stale even two months beyond the date. Beware, it's hard to stop eating Cracker Jack."
crappy crabmeat,The so-called crabmeat is pure mush. I don't think it is really crabmeat. Forget about it !!!!
Wellness Rocks...!!!,"I am a huge fan of Wellness, as well as a few other holistic brands of animal food. I am new to this product, as we have just been adopted by a brother and sister pair. This is even better than the adult formula we were giving them in the mean time, because this satiates them by giving them more of what they need, so I actually have to feed them less.<br /><br />To those poo-pooing the fruits, veggies, seeds etc., the protein and fat content are the highest you can find outside of making it yourself, and you would still find yourself having to add these items. Even though cats are true carnivores and most wouldn't eat these other things by themselves in the wild, the fact is is that they DO eat non-meat items, when they eat their prey. They don't just eat muscle, they also eat the contents of the intestines, stomach, crops, and gizzards, and many try to get in the skull for the fats and lipids (because most wild prey will be very lean this is often the only place to get them). The trick is getting everything in the right proportions, and using actual, nutritious food.<br /><br />The price, yes, it is more. But, my family has had many, many, animals over the last 25 years, and we have seen the difference that a GOOD diet makes. And in the long run, it can help save an awful lot in vet bills."
Great tasting Mangoes!,"Great tasting Mangoes.  They do have about 32g of sugar per serving (about 6 pieces), but they don't taste artificial like so many others do.  Overall these are my favorite dried mangoes."
Wonderful taste. Love these bars,This was the first time I purchased this flavor of lara bars and they are wonderful! If you love coconut you will love these.  If it had chocolate it would have reminded to of my favorite childhood candy. Almond joys.
the very best product,"Both my 2 grandsons and I are enjoying this product. We are using it both as a sweetener and as a antibacterial. My grandsons want nothing else when comes to enjoy their breakfast and I use it very successfully for treating any skin problems they and I have. I am very happy for coming across this product and I try to make sure it is always available in my house.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O0BL9E"">Active MGO 400+ (Old 20+) Manuka Honey 100% Pure by Manuka Health New Zealand Ltd. - 250 g</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018XX0WI"">100% Active 20+ Sterile Australian Manuka Honey Wound Management</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK08OC"">Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+, 17.6-Ounce Jar</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJUIN4"">Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 12+, 8.8-Ounce Jar</a>"
"Love the Product, Not the Packaging","The coffee is great, but I was shocked when I bought this in the store. Shame on me for not paying attention to the item count. The box normally holds 12 cups, but when I opened it - only 10. That's the marketing plan, reduce the cost and short the number of cups. They didn't even bother to redo the packaging, just put in 10 instead of 12. Seriously, don't support this behavior. Shame on Starbucks!"
Trouble opening the cans,"I don't know if anyone else has trouble with the pull-tabs on these Canidae cans but I sure do.  The tab part is very flimsy and doesn't hold up well while trying to pull open the top.  I have almost cut myself several times.  End up having to pry the top off with a fork after the pull-top breaks off.  Otherwise it's an acceptable product, although I do prefer Evangers.  But Evangers has become more expensive for some reason."
The emperor has no clothes,"I have had real truffles only once that I can recall, and that very old memory is of a sublime taste.  The slippery terminology used for 'truffle' oil gave me pause, but I decided to take a chance.  To me, ""infused"" implies that something has been marinated in a liquid, not that a chemical has been simply mixed in.  Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle ""aroma.""<br /><br />When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic-like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.<br /><br />Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.  I rated this at 2 stars rather than one on the charitable assumption that a younger nose might detect some sort of aroma."
"Beefy, but salty","The good: the beef is cut thickly and has a steak-y taste.<br />The bad: the jerky is extremely salty to the point that it made me feel ill if I ate more than a few pieces.<br />About me: I am a rabid jerk-o-phile, and I regularly consume mass quantities of the stuff."
The Step Between the Bags & Captain Picard's Way,"I've tried this tea by the bag and it does tend to be milder than your average supermarket Tetley or Lipton. But I've been drinking Bigelow Green Tea that way for about a year and I wanted to revisit Earl Grey via a Keurig-clone machine I got for my birthday over the summer. After I went through a couple of ""variety packs"" I picked up an Ekobrew Refillable basket and started drinking expresso done that way for my morning coffee. I admit, using a Keurig machine is still a bit low tech compared to just asking for ""Earl Grey, hot"" in my best Patrick Stewart imitation (which isn't very good) but give Mr. Coffee 10-20 years and they'll come up with a voice-activated machine. After all, if I'd wanted to pay another c-note per month, the car I've been leasing since last year could have come with that technology."
This stuff in awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a person who loves her ""Hot"" hot sauce!!! And let me tell you, I respect this salsa!!!!! You only need a couple of drops of this stuff and you get that wonderful burn on anything you put it on. You can add it to hot wing sauce and get a smokin' hot flavor. Just add about a half of a teaspoon to a jar of Hooters sauce and you got the best hot wings around. If you put too much on something, it will burn the tastebuds off and then you can't taste nothing but hot. I love this salsa!!!! It's the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Don't like taste, but do like medicinal qualities","Out of curiosity, I chose to purchase this particular flavor of Two Leaves and a Bud at my local grocer.  I do not like the taste of the tea without sweetner -- it is very bitter even when using a lower temp for the water (because its green tea) and this is the first time I've ever tasted a green tea that I didn't care for -- The Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Green is divine!  With sweetener, the Orange Sencha Green is tolerable (for me).  What I like about this green tea is its medicinal effects.  On the back of all Two Leaves & A Bud packages are brief statements listing what types of foods the teas pair with and/or what the tea is ""best for.""  The Orange Sencha Green Tea states that it is best for concentration ... and it is.  If I'm feeling particulary foggy headed or out of sorts (lol), I drink a mug of Orange Sencha Green and it clears my head right up!  I appreciate teas that have effective medicinal qualities that are evident within a few sips and this makes up for the unpleasant (my opinion) taste.  I will continue to purchase it and would recommend it as a good reading or studying tea."
Freshen Up Spearment Gum,"I was happy to find this gum again! Could have been a little fresher, but the seller made it right, and that goes along way. I recommend this product!<br />Cathy"
Wonderful and authentic,"I went to Egypt and had hibiscus tea in Nubia...and all I could find at WalMart was this blended Tazo passion tea!  It was good, mind you, but not pure hibiscus by any stretch of the imagination.  I was very happy to find this tea (and so cheap, too).  Tastes just like it did in Nubia.  I mean, it's a one-ingredient thing, so it's kind of hard to screw up.  But for the record: this stuff is exactly as described.  I am pleased."
Love this product,"Just be forewarned it is a bit ""moist.""  Have plenty of papertowels/napkins around when eating it.<br /><br />However for vegan jerky, this has by far the best texture. You will be picking it out of your teeth for hours! And for me, that is a good thing!<br /><br />My fav is the BBQ flavor, however their other flavors are very tasty as well :-)"
Great Product,I love this stevia! I have tried MANY different kinds over the years and this one is my FAVE! Goes great in my coffee and tea. I have this one on auto ship and get one a month (makes it pretty cheap too!)
Organic Mommy,I cannot say enough about these Happytot pouches!! My toddler loves them! I have to remind my daughter (who is in elementary school) that these are for her brother and I have other snacks for her! I love that it contains the salba. Anyway that I can get the Omega 3's in my picky toddler's diet I am all for it. I am also very happy anytime I can find healthy foods that are gluten/dairy free. I have actually tasted these myself and I think they are great too! When I compare the ingredients to other organic pouches they are by far the healthier choice.
"Delicious, but definitely seasonal from Amazon",Very tasty. A definitely seasonal type with excellent spices and flavor. One box lasted me the whole season. Will definitely buy it again next year.
"Great product, but...",Why on earth would anywone pay close to $10 a bag when WalMart is selling the 11 oz bag for under $4.00? Shoppers do you homework first before becoming a victim of such over pricing.
Tully's Italian Roast Rules!,Great choice for a K-Cup Coffee!  Great flavor is in these Kups! I've tried sampler packs and this one stands out as a great Kup any time of day!  I praised my Cuisinart for years with fresh ground beans but TIR is so easy in the Kurig and the taste is superior!
My cats love em!,"My two kitties love these food pouches, and they seem to enjoy all the flavors equally. They get all excited when I'm preparing it for them, as one might expect, and I'm the cost isn't too bad either (about $0.62/pouch). So for what it's worth, this product definitely has approval from this owner, and kitties too!"
work great,I use these all the time and they work great. I will buy these again because they are so easy to use.
"Extremely ginger, with not much lemon","I personally didn't care much for it, but I can respect it as an interesting ginger beverage. You can make it hot or cold. For me, as a hot drink it was okay, though more ginger than I really needed. As a cold drink, it had a bit of a chemical aftertaste. It claims to be all natural, but it seemed like a taste I associate with artificial sweeteners."
Love it!,"Smooth. Full of flavor. Not bitter. No nasty aftertaste. People that like Newmans extra bold, Starbucks Verona and Sumatra, Tullys French Roast and other dark cup should love this.  It's better!"
not very good at all,I was very disappointed with this dairy free mac and cheese -- I did it like I would make other mac and cheese  -- I always melt the butter and add the mix - then the milk  --  ( I tried both soy and regular-- )  mix them in sauce pan  -- I was upset because first of price and then it tasted terrible --  I have done other mac and cheese mixes and there is something wrong with calling them mac and cheese --  They are elbows and whatever the sauce is -- It tastes like card board-- I have used lots of different soy cheeses - and other non dairy mixes -- this is awful  --  I wouldn't waste your money on it  --
Great ~ BUT,"This peanut butter is very tasty ~ BUT.  As with the majority of natural peanut butters, this one has to be stirred when it is first opened to redistribute the oils.  This particular peanut butter doesn't seem to have enough oil, which means when you're about halfway through the jar, the peanut butter is like concrete - very unspreadable.  I am on my third jar of the 4-pack, and it is like this every time, even after many minutes of stirring.  It still tastes good, so if you're eating it right out of the jar, that might not be a problem.  I spread it on toast, and spreading concrete is very challenging!  So, this peanut butter would get 5 stars for flavor and ingredients, but I took two stars off for spreadability."
I like this mustard a lot...BUT,"...But, I wish I had bought the powder instead. If you have never tried this mustard before, get the powder. You just add a little water (or other liquids) and make it a paste when you're ready to use it. This jar is SUPER small. For the price it would have been much better to just get the powder, and be able to use it in dry rubs for meats as well as a wet mustard paste. If you have never had this product before, it tastes like a dijon with a stronger kick, almost like a chinese mustard. With the dry mustard you can add more to make it stronger (which i like to do b/c this isnt hot enough for my taste!!). So, word of the wise: buy the powder mustard!!"
just run of the mill black tea,Nothing special and absolutely no grapefruit taste.  This should have been sold as an average black tea.  If you want any flavor you better add your own.
"Good, but.................","We bought this coffee based on all the hype (Food & Wine Magazine, ""handcrafted"" , ""Estate"" , etc)  but as serious coffee drinkers, we didn't feel this was worth the high price (especially when shipping is added). It had a pleasant, full bodied taste, but so do a lot of other, more easily available and less expensive coffees.<br /><br />Starbucks for example,  has enough different varieties of coffee where you'll find one blend very similar if not as good (or better) tasting than the much lauded Kona........just our $0.02"
"Terrific for soups, anything, really, this is a keeper!","For us, this is one of the most important products that Amazon carries,  I'm a porph, and can't have garlic or onion in food. It's very difficult for me to find a broth that is ""safe"" and this one is perfect, Plus it tastes good!  And is organic,  It's really the perfect broth,  I make lots and lots of soups, stews, and various other concoctions in my beloved crockpot, so these little pouches are being slices open almost every day,  They are so convenient, We have a small kitchen so space is limited, these are perfect in that respect also,  In fact I'm going to reorder them today!"
Amazing service.,"I guess I should focus on the product more than the company, but I can't help it!  I started thinking it would be smart to buy bulk, whole spices online since it's cheaper and more efficient.  So, I noticed Whole Spice here on Amazon and decided to go with them!<br /><br />The nutmeg I purchased is great!  It arrived in less than one week, packaged very well, and the glass bottle the nutmeg is held in is clearly very thick and durable.  Not to mention, the label is even pretty - always a bonus!  :)<br /><br />The 1.1 oz bottle has about 8-10 nuts that were all a very good size.  I'm almost sure it could last me a lifetime.  So, the price of this product is obviously a good deal, and from experience, much cheaper than most grocery stores (including mega-stores, like Walmart.)"
I love this machine so much.,"I LOVE this machine so much! My mother- in- law purchased this machine and gave it to me.<br />I am a working mom and too busy all the times to cook. But just right after first cooking baby food with this Baby Brezza, I got to get love it!<br />This is super easy and simple to cook, i just toss the ingredients in the jar, press buttons, and feed my baby.<br />Every aspect got me satisfied - easy cooking/cleaning method, good size to store on the counter top, cute design and etc.<br /><br />And plus, Asian moms(like me) feed baby grains such as rice, barley and beans, very often, cooking grains with grain basket in baby brezza machine is also SO easy and simple - literally ONE STEP BABY FOOD MAKER."
love this stuff,"I had been making all our baby food but we took a long cross-country driving trip and I knew there was no way to keep doing that. So, I did some research (i.e asking other parents  and found these. OUr little guys LOVES this food. He immediately ate an entire pouch, and since has eaten alot of it. It tastes like pear, and has lots of fiber."
Delicious! Fool your friends!,"Great product.<br /><br />I'm a lousy cook.<br />So this product saved my diner. It's easy to prepare and delicious.<br />I followed the instructions and used some prime beef.<br />Everybody loved it! The coconut NUT and the coconut flavor seemed very fresh and rich. I do not like peanuts... but I could hardly feel it.<br /><br />Great if you want to have something different. So go for it!<br /><br />Suggestion: I like a thicker sauce. So it all depends on how you prepare it. And I like onions, so I put some in it too. Loved it."
amazing snack - even for picky eaters,"My family of picky eaters loves these things...  I buy them by the case from amazon... I love that I can ""binge"" and not feel guilty... and for my kids, they are a great snack in lunches or whenever.  My kids and their friends just love them.,. they have the appeal of ""junk food"" without the junk...."
What's not to like,Found these for a great deal..split the box with a friend and we both loved them.
YES.,"I can't find these poptarts anywhere near where I live, and amazon offers them for such a low price per unit that I had to buy them."
Good dessert if you are concerned about nutrition,"First, this won't be served at your high-end ice cream shop because that isn't what it is.  It is a good ice cream substitute for those who want a good dessert with only 150 calories.<br /><br />When we received this 40 pack, my kids tried it and wouldn't finish the container. That meant that the rest was for me!<br /><br />It isn't H&auml;agen-Dazs. I've since learned if you set it out to thaw first, it they taste much better and are easier to eat.  The consistency is somewhat like ice milk but don't be put off by that. I really like them and will likely purchase more of them."
Good buy,"My 25 lb mutt loves these. It takes her weeks to months to get through one rawhide, so I feel set for a while. Will purchase again when she finally destroys all 16."
Great Tea,This tea is very flavorful.  Definitely does not need sugar as it has some inherent sweetness.  It makes for great iced tea with some honey.
Dog goes crazy over these!,My dog has been loving these chews for years! I give him one everyday and it has done a great job at keeping plaque and tartar build up at bay.
Healthy choice for dog w/ food allergies/sensitive stomach,"My 8-year old Cocker Spaniel has been on several types of food (Nutro, Iams, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, and regular Wellness). She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!"
Great Taste,"Can't find these in individual size packages locally so this has answered my family's needs.  Have tried most of the varieties, but we prefer the original flavor."
Perfect tasty snack from Amazon,What a perfect combination - pretzles and peanut butter.  It is one of the best tasting snacks I have eaten for a long time.  I like the size of the bag also.  Crunchy and salty.  I could not find anything about product that I did not like or want to change.  It is a top notch treat!
Cherry Lifesavers,"My husband loves cherry lifesavers, but we could no longer find just the flavor cherry.  This is a great purchase since we were able to buy this product in bulk.  They last for a long time!"
Perfect Dirty Martini Mix,Perfect for mixing dirty martinis.  You won't run out of juice and have just olives left in the jar from the grocery store.  A perfect addition to your bar supplies.  Packaged very well.
The BEST Tuna I've Ever Eaten!,"I'd never heard of ""tuna ventresca"" before, so I thought I'd try some - and I must say it is the tastiest tuna I've ever had in my entire life, and well worth the rather steep price tag.  FAR superior to the run-of-the-mill tuna out of a can, such that there simply is no comparison.<br /><br />The first time I ever tried a jar, I ended up eating the entire contents in one sitting!  Try it - you'll probably like it!<br /><br />Somehow I have a feeling that this stuff is going to be habit-forming - but a healthy habit for sure!"
"Taste great, soft to chew","Taste like carmels except softer.  Ingredients:  Sugar, Corn Syrup, Plant Stanol Estrs, Nonfat Milk, less than 2% of Caramel color, Soy lecithin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, and yellow 6.  Sodium 15 mg per chew or serving.  0.85 g of Plant Stanol Esters per chew.  2 per day recommended on package.  Expiration was about 14 months beyond the date I recieved so that was good."
"Good, but not great.","The candies taste nice, but I was disappointed with a few things. For starters, it had HFCS listed as one of the main ingredients. I would honestly expect that a candy this pricey would at least be made from sugar, but this was not the case.<br /><br />The price is another thing that I found to be disappointing. For the amount that I had paid, I would have certainly expected at least a little bit more in the package. The bag is roughly the size of a small bag of chips, but is inflated with a lot of air. Each small package inside contains two candy beads roughly the size of large pearls. So the package appears small for the large price and the amount of candy inside is smaller still.<br /><br />I wasn't completely disappointed, though. As I said, the candy has a pleasant flavor--a nice mild, sweet milk taste. It's just unfortunate that the candy is made with seemingly common/sub-par ingredients and yet priced at a higher quality price point.<br /><br />I believe another commenter suggested that you wait to purchase these at a nearby Asian grocer, and if this is a possibility for you I would suggest the same."
Lindor Dark Chocolate Truffles,"I am completely happy with my order of Lindor Dark Chocolate Truffles. They arrived on the exact day estimated and had been packed in ice cooler bags to protect them from the summer heat.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RNYAHM"">Lindt Lindor Truffles Dark Chocolate, 120-Count Box</a> I will be buying from Amazon again."
Local Grocery store may be cheaper,"I found 4 lb. bags of yellow popcorn from a popular brand available at my local grocery store for $3.87/bag.  They were even dated to ""best sold by 3/13'.  That comes to under 97 cents a pound.  Paragon bulk might be pretty good but I can buy 12 pounds locally for $11.61 which is close to $5.00 cheaper than listed here of equally good popcorn.  Sometimes looking around locally is a better buy."
Best chips ever?  Probably!,"SWEET POTATO<br />Pros:<br />- Amazing Taste<br />- Good packaging, almost no chips ever broken, all full shape.<br />- Great nutrition for such a tasty chip (hardly any salt)<br />- Perfect serving in the bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hard to open the bag<br /><br />These chips are now my favorite brand, especially these sweet potato ones.  Since the order comes in a big ""retail box"" that comes with a count of 24, i gave them to out to friends and coworkers.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON was blown away by the taste.  Ironically, every person also commented on how hard it was to open the actual package. :)  Now the next dilemma is trying to decide... should i buy the sweet potato ones since they were so good, or try another flavor.<br /><br />For the current asking price, it is actually cheaper than buying other branded chips at the store.  Once again, these things blew my mind in that chips could be so good."
Great Stuff..,"Pretty good heat.  Like the small bags, makes it stay fresher longer, and keeps the heat alive. Great taste over the peas."
great stuff.,The cereal is fantastic. The baby likes it and the probiotics help with constipation problems when starting food.
I love it!,"The first time I had this tea was at Starbucks, the Grove.  I had diarrhea that day, not feeling well, so I ordered this tea.  I was intrigued by the fine packaging and the fresh looking mint leaves in it.  The flavor was soothing, my stomach felt much better after that.  This is how I got to know Harney & Sons... I love their teas but one flavor..."
cat food,"It's a nice snack with salsa when I'm watching tv.  Just kidding, the cats seem to like it. I'm supposed to write more words so I can submit this review. That should do it."
Love Orgain!,"Great taste and healthy ingredients, we use this as a meal replacement - very filling and sufficient. Hubby prefers Vanilla, Son prefers Chocolate :) Both are great!"
Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea,"I received this item through the Amazon Vine Program.  My overall impression of this tea is that it is alright, but nothing to get excited about.  Let me be more specific:<br /><br />The predominate flavor that comes through is Hibiscus, which makes sense since it is the number one item in the list of ingredients (ingredients are listed from the largest concentration to the lowest concentration in the product).  If you are a fan of hibiscus, this will not bother you.  The blackberry is in there, but I have a very difficult time finding any vanilla flavor.  No where in the list of ingredients is vanilla listed.<br /><br />The tea bag is unique, but I am not sure that it really adds anything.  In fact, it seems to take a bit away in the aspect that it does not appear to be a recyclable material.  Paper composts well, but I am not sure about the material that this weave is made from. There is no indication on the package as to what is being used. As for brewing, I do not find that this bag allows it to brew any faster or better than any of the bags that I have used on other products, including ones from Lipton.<br /><br />While this is an ok tea, I do not find anything in it to make me want to recommend it to anyone."
YOU'LL NEVER MISS THE SODIUM!!!!,"I'm always on the lookout for products with low--or NO-- salt, because I have Meniere's Disase which requires an EXTREMELY low sodium diet. I found this tomato sauce in a local 'gourmet' type store, and decided to try a can. (The price was REAL scary, but it's SO hard to find good things...)<br />Well, folks, let me tell you - you'd never know this sauce is low-sodium!  It's perfectly seasoned and tastes delicious!!  A friend suggested I check Amazon.com, and was thrilled to find it; and at a significantly lower price.  I'm partway through my first 12-pack, and will definitely continue to order it. (I'm pretty sure I'm going to do ""Subscribe & Save"", and save even more next time.)<br />Just FYI, it's great on more than just pasta -- I've used it on both chicken and pork; eggplant and zucchini, and rice.<br /><br />As Julia Child used to say -- ""Yum!"""
Now I know why Dad switched,"The older one gets , the more sensitive the digestive system is. This is a delicious alternative to the over-bearing coffees already on the market.<br />A very smooth , pleasing taste , which was not bitter in the least.<br />The package went a long way and left me wanting more."
Awesome popcorn!,Bought this popcorn because it looked good. It is sooooo good. When you put it in your mouth you feel like your mouth is full. It is a pleasure to chew and a little of this popcorn is better than a whole bowl of regular popcorn. My family is sold on mushroom popcorn.
Lemon flavored cookies - YUM!,"I found the lemon flavored Nonni's Biscotti at my local grocery store,in the deli section.<br />The other flavored cookies did not appeal to me. They were too heavy and hard. These<br />lemon flavored ones are great dunked in my hot tea. I usually have 2 a day and greatly<br />savor them as I work at my computer. I try and enjoy these treats five times a week.<br />By the way, they quit handling my Limone Biscotti at my store and I went looking for<br />a new source and found it thru Amazon.com. Many thanks for your service and prompt<br />filling of my orders."
Search Ended,It's hard to find this peach flavored black tea in the market. I was glad to find it online and at a good price.
Noticed Increase,I have been taking this tea for about two weeks now. There is a noticable change in my production. I went to from pumping about 3oz to 5oz. My baby seems satisfied/full when nursing now. I didn't have to supplement with formula at all this week. I also like the taste.
Great Food Great Price!,We have found that you can pick up this product way cheaper on Amazon than you can at your local supermarket.
Makes Mommy's Job Easy,This product is a great way to make sure you little ones eat healthy without all the fuss.  My kids love the taste and I love the organic ingredients.  Baby and toddler are happy and well fed.  I love any product that makes my life easier and this is one I give 5 stars.
Great stuff!,"My daughter often had a Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) for breakfast when she was in high school, leading my wife and I to give her grief for not having a good breakfast.<br /><br />Years later, when my aging father was ill and it was difficult to get him to eat as doctors said he should, a nurse recommended CIB, saying that it was a complete meal. Fortunately, my father loved it.<br /><br />Since then at least two other nurses have mentioned it to me, and for the past several years I've been drinking it fairly regularly. Now, it's rare that a day goes by when I don't have CIB for one of my meals.<br /><br />A major ice storm hit the rural area I live in recently, knocking out power, telephone, and even cellular service and water. Part of a tree in our front yard landed on the power line, and limbs of two tall trees fell onto our driveway, blocking our means of exit.<br /><br />Fortunately we had a fresh box of CIB on hand (French Vanilla, our favorite flavor) and a gallon of milk (which we kept ""refrigerated"" by keeping it in a cooler outside where the temps were below freezing). After that experience I realized that having a supply of CIB plus some powdered milk and bottled water on hand was as important as having flashlights, a portable radio, batteries, candles, and matches, etc., in case of emergency.<br /><br />I'm a big guy who likes to eat and who does a fair amount of physical labor, and a glass of CIB fills me up, gives me an energy boost, and keeps me satisfied till lunchtime (assuming I've had it in the morning; sometimes I have it for lunch instead).<br /><br />When I travel by car to visit relatives out of state I carry a supply of CIB with me. They may offer me eggs and sausage or bacon, etc., for breakfast, but if I have my CIB and milk is available, that and a good cup of coffee are all I need. I've also gotten into the habit of carrying a thermos with a pre-mixed CIB drink in it when I go on such road trips, so that I can have that for a meal when I'm on the road instead of having a McDonald's meal. I have noticed that I stay more awake and alert throughout the 8 1/2 hour drive if I substitute a CIB for a McMeal, and don't feel a need to pull into a rest area for a nap as I usually do after eating a McMeal.<br /><br />I swear by it and even though Amazon's price is only a few cents below what my local WalMart charges, getting CIB delivered to the door 3 boxes at a time is convenient and seems a good way to avoid ever getting low on it.<br /><br />I like it blended with a banana too, and in hot weather blending CIB with a banana and a scoop of vanilla ice cream makes for an extra special treat.<br /><br />I have apologized to my daughter for giving her a hard time about her CIB breakfasts when she was in high school. When I tell her that at least 3 nurses have raved about CIB to me, she says, ""See? SEE? And you and mom gave me such a hard time, telling me it wasn't enough to have for breakfast! Grrrr!!"" ;-)"
TASTE REALLY GOOD,"THESE GARLIC BREADSTICKS ARE OFF THE HOOK, ITS HARD TO FIND BREADSTICKS IN THE STORE ANYMORE, THESE ARE SO GOOD AND SO WORTH THE MONEY, IT AVERAGES OUT TO AROUND $1.25 A BOX, DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THEN THAT"
Great innovation,This stuff is really good!  I like to stir it up in honey and yoghurt for a cool pudding.  Quite tasty.
These are very good cookies.,"These cookies are very good.  They have a nice texture because of the oats and they have a great taste.  They are my favorite cookie.  If you like oats, you likely will enjoy these cookies."
The Best,"I have not purchased from this seller yet, but I have used this exact coffee repeatedly.  I have tried many other decaf. coffees, and this is the best in terms of strong, smooth flavor, which is essential in my opinion if you are a decaf. drinker.  It's the closest taste to the natural flavor enhancement that comes with caffeine."
Best Price Available,Love this tea but it's hard to find at a reasonable price. It's always in stock and gets here in a few days. All the stores where I used to get Licorice Tea have discontinued it so this is a wonderful way to be sure I have plenty in stock in the house.
A tang that packs a punch!,"My daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked."
GROWNUP MAC & CHEESE AND MORE...,"This is a grownup version of Macaroni & Cheese. You're safe, the broccoli are a mere sprinkling of the green, not enough to over run the White Cheddar Cheese flavor. I actually made a side dish of broccoli. I'm trying to get the teenager to eat more green vegetables. He mixed his broccoli in! Manager Special at less than a buck a box.<br /><br />Like most of the RONI packed mixes, it's quick, tasty and filling. You add water, butter and milk to the mix and in less than 15 MICROWAVE minutes you can eat. Just that 27% of your daily sodium limit is in each serving, when your monitoring that stuff.<br /><br />NOTE: The individual packages have a sell by date of May, 2010. We'll use up the 12 packs by then, but I'm leery of expiration dates that are close in.<br /><br />*** Microwave Recipe Variations without milk:<br />1.0 Cook pasta according to directions. Mix spice packet WITHOUT the milk and you have a tasty side dish without the dairy calories.<br /><br />1.5 Add 2 cups of chicken broth (2 buillon cubes + 2 cups of water) to the above variation. HEAT on HIGH for 4 minutes covered and you have a tasty soup.<br /><br />2.0 One Dish Meal...CHICKEN BREAST WITH PASTA-RONI ROBUSTO<br />Using round microwave dish mix 1 TBLSP olive oil, 2 TBLSP water, 1 tsp Italian Spice and a pinch of crushed Red Pepper Flakes. Then coat 2 skinless chicken breasts with mixture. Next cook covered on HIGH for 3 minutes. Follow usual Pasta Roni directions by adding the water and pasta to the chicken, until pasta is done. ADD the PastaRoni spice packet and toss . Then add 1 14oz can of Chunky Tomatoes and cook covered on HIGH for 3 minutes.<br />  My Son really liked it... suggested I slice the chicken breasts and make it a casserole. Since I started with FROZEN chicken that wasn't happening."
BEST. GUM. EVER.,This is the absolute best gum flavor ever.  It really tastes like Key Lime Pie and the flavor lasts a long time. Yummy!
The one I like best,I'm surprised there are not more reviews for this pasta. I've tried other brands and this one is easily my favorite. The simplicity of the ingredients is appealing and it retains a nice texture when cooked. I've tried it with different sauces and have never been disappointed.
Canidae Dry Dog Food,"This is a great product. It is very healthy for all of our dogs, and it is the first food that they all love to eat. It helped my older dog lose weight and my 10 year old lab gain the weight he needed to be healthy."
Delicious!,"Love, love, love the cherries.  They are so awesome and delicious.  We ate some of them and they are wonderful.  I have used some of them in chocolate chip cookies and they too are great."
Tastes awful,"If you've tasted a protein shake before, you'll know the ""protein-ish"" flavor that (personally) tastes awful. This drink mix makes the water taste exactly like that, masked by a fake strawberry flavor."
soda,being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder,This is wonderful cinnamon.  It is so much better than the regular ground cinnamon we find in our every day stores in the U.S.  This ceylon cinnamon is not bitter like the regular cinnamon.  I recommend everyone at least try this Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder.  I will be ordering more because my husband and I love it.
coffee,I was told by my son best coffee he has tried He is a expert on coffee.I just can`t seem to be able to have enough in my pantry before I run out before ordering again
kona?,This is certainly a blend - not much Kona flavor.  I realize it is easier for the coffee makers to make pricing the same for all blends - I'd be willing to pay more for more KONA!  Tim's Kona blend is much tastier...
Very tasty!,"I just bought these, and I am really impressed! Very crunchy, nutty, good berry flavor. My ten year old even liked them! Plus, I felt like I was snacking on something halfway healthy. I'm going to try the vanilla flavor next..."
Nostalgia aside- this is a great cereal,"I've tried all of my local supermarkets, Target and Wal-Mart.  The only place I could find this cereal is Amazon. Go Amazon!! I've been looking for this cereal for a while now.  I used to love it as a kid and I was pleased to find out that I still do.  The only negatives are that there aren't as many big chunks as there were in the past and the little bits tend to get soggy very quickly.  This cereal is really sweet so be careful because you can easily get tired of them quickly.  I love em though.  Perfectly sweet and crunchy."
"Yummy, Cheesy Breakfast","You can't beat grits with your breakfast, but they are even better with some diced Velveeta put in at the end.  Stir off the heat until thoroughly melted and incorporated.  It doesn't take much to get that great, cheesy flavor.  This product also keeps great in the refrigerator, much longer than regular cheese.  Yum..."
truly nasty,"This is unlike any chai I've smelled or tasted.  The the cassia oil and maple oil totally overwhelm the clove, orange peel, cardamom and cinnamon (the bag does not list orange peel, cassia oil or maple oil as ingredients, but Amazon's website does).  I can't even be in the same room as the closed bag of tea without getting a headache and feeling like retching.  Had to get it out of the house."
"Wonderful smooth brew,  lingering aroma at excellet price!","I dont't normally leave a review,but due to the costs of the kcups, i recently purchased an ekobrew reusable filter for my Keurig. Upon finding this item<br />( 36 for 20.00) I thought okay , I will try it. The rainforest brew is a true medium brew, just a bit on the light side, and finishes wonderfully and smooth. The aroma from brewing one cup lingered in my kitchen for hours! Yes, you cannot ""display"" them in a Keurig holder due to the packaging, but I store mine in a tin next to keurig, clean and tightly sealed. No drip, no problem with brewing in my machine. Love this item, will be back for more."
My lab broke it within 2 days,My 8 month old yellow lab destroyed the rope almost immediately.  She also watched me fill it with toys and chewed on the screw off part until she broke the cover.  Then she chewed up the bottle.  Not for the heavy chewers like Labs.
Awsome,realy good cand if you are a sour lover.tags are cool good soury bursting exiting likeing war heads mega mix
Wholesome,"My one year old loves lentils, so I was happy when I found a good sized portion of GMO Free lentils. They cooked well and tasted delicious. They are a little smaller than what you usually get at the grocery store, but that might be cause they are Spanish Brown."
"Dogs Love them, but not in my living room....","Let me start by saying, our dogs LOVE these!  The sticks were in their Christmas stockings, and even our older dog, who doesn't like to chew on anything (even food), LOVES these!!!  It kept our 4 month old puppy busy for hours Christmas morning while the kids were able to peacefully open their gifts!  That said, they smell.  The sticks have been in our house for 3 days now, and although it doesn't bother me too much, the rest of the family has decided these sticks will stay in the basement, where the dogs play when we are not home.  They are no longer allowed in our living room.<br /><br />The price is great, the sticks look like they'll last our 14 & 20 pound dogs a week or two each, and the dogs surely do love them."
Sinful Indulgence But Calorie Conscious,"You get a good idea what you're in for just from the name: fudge drizzle caramel popcorn. And the taste doesn't disappoint; the popcorn is crisp, the caramel is buttery-good, and fudge is chocolately good. And a bag is just 130 calories, which shouldn't ruin anyone's diet.<br /><br />That being said, nothing is free in this world...so 130 calories amounts to a fairly small (but satisfying) serving. Just right for inclusion in a lunchbox for dessert, or for a special ""reward"" for those of us who need to count calories."
Colombian decaf,I have tried several decaf K-cubs and have found this to be the best. My husband does not like decaf but has finally found this one he will drink because it has a little bolder taste.I find it a good coffee to have in the house for company because everyone seems to like it. I will be ordering it again and again!
"tastes good, but not like eggnog","I was hesitant to try this tea because I thought eggnog-flavored tea sounded like a weird combination, and I'm not even a big fan of eggnog by itself.  However, it turns out it doesn't really taste like eggnog anyway!  It has a mild nutty/vanilla flavor to it instead; it's very similar to the Celestial Seasonings ""Nutcracker Sweet"" flavor.  I like it, but probably not enough for it to displace my other favorite flavors.  (A person can only drink so much tea....  so many flavors, so little time....)"
Wow!  Now that's a cuppa coffee!,"This stuff rocks!  Absolutely fabulous cup of coffee.  I do wish that it were a lot less expensive than $1 per cup, though...like maybe Starbuck's would make it available by the pound!"
"Great, but almost too sweet.","This is a very chocolaty cereal, turning the milk chocolate.  My kids love it, but it is a bit sweet to have on regular basis."
"Unlike other cereals, well suited to survive shipping","You probably already know what Shredded Wheat cereal is (if not, try it!). This is a money-saving, easy way to buy it. Unlike certain other cereals, Shredded Wheat is well suited for shipping. Almost all biscuits were in good shape, as you expect when buying at the store, when they have arrived. The few that suffered (usually just partially broken) did not affect my breakfast experience at all since I just break the biscuits up with my spoon anyway.<br /><br />Cheaper than the store and arrive in good condition. Recommended."
Delicious -  hey wait a minute.,"Our household is addicted to this stuff.  It's a little pricey, but when you break it down to the delicious, fulfilling, low-calorie, high-protein nutrition you get, it's worth it.  At least to us.  We finally got on the regular shipment plan to save 15% per month.  Yay, Amazon.<br /><br />[Time passes]<br /><br />Hmmmm... I am starting to suspect there are two versions of this product.  One you buy in the health food store and pay top dollar for... and this one.  I have never had an issue with quality control with this product before.  However, with this multi-pack I am finding that in every pouch there are a couple/few pieces that should have not made it past inspection - cut too thick to eat without soaking and/or too grisely to consider worthy of this price.<br /><br />So, hopefully it was just a few bag bags and maybe that's been straightened out.  But I hope this is not the new version.  We really do love this stuff- the high quality product we are used to, not the thick, grisely version."
homemade taste,"Thick broth -tasty tender white chicken and NOT salty. The best canned soup we have EVER had - even better than ""fresh"" soupd available at many ""big box"" member store deli departments."
bread mixes,bought as gift for hard to buy for father...he LOVED  bread said it was delicious !!
Favorite Green Tea,"This is my favorite green tea to share with friends.  The aroma when adding the hot water and while the ta is brewing is delightful, and just a prelude to the wonderful flavor of this tea.  Not to mention the health benefits of a cup of green tea to start the day!  I love watching the pearls unfurl in my brewer.  There is no bitter aftertaste -- and I can get two brewings from the same pearls."
YUMMY !!!,"You absolutely will love the TRUE fruit flavor of these gummys.  They are positively addicting.  By purchasing this 5# bag, I am able to make several decorative individual bags or boxes for gifts.  We also enjoy them while playing cards, as they are a ""neat"" treat, and do not dirty or sticky-up the cards."
sweeties,"thank you for your fast service ,i havernt had these chocolates in a long time ,happy new year,i will be ordering more english food from you later in the year .thanks"
Halloween special?,"Amazon advertises this with their Halloween specials, however, despite the fact that I ordered it on Oct. 20, the shipment confirmation indicates I will not receive it until sometime between Nov. 15-30. Maybe it should be advertised as a Thanksgiving or Christmas special instead. I had difficulty rating it because I'm guessing the product will be the usual great taste of Reese's PBC but I'd rate Amazon a zero on the false advertising & delivery."
Good Product,I was looking for whole barley flour because of its many benefits. I was so happy to find this product available with a reasonable price.
so good!,"Not much to say about this fudge, other than it is awesome!! If you like fudge in general (vanilla and other non-chocolate flavors), and you like caramel, then you should definately try the dulce de leche fudge. It's only downside is that it is so so sooo sweet...but it's fudge. It's supposed to be sweet. Buying from Mo's Fudge factor was great too. they shipped out quickly, and when I received the package, I saw that they had written ""perishable"" on the box, which I was very happy to see. Although it seems like it should be a standard practice for perishable items, it is not as common a thing as you might think. A lot of companies would and do overlook the need for that. In my case it was extremely helpful, because my mail comes at different times of day throughout each month, so I never know when to look for it to show up. My mailman usually just leaves my packages by my mailbox, and I eventaully find them outside, sometimes hours later, but this time he rang my bell for the first time in ages. Im assuming that was due to the perishable label...So, to sum up - great fudge, great company."
Delicious!,This is the first time I have tried a South Beach product and I am sure glad I did. The have a wonderful taste and are very filling. I will check out more of their granola bars and try them also.<br /><br />120 calories will fit into my snack plan for the day. Also a good dessert. Very pleased with these bars. Thank you South Beach and Vine for allowing me to try these.
YUMMY,"Just add water and you have a tasty nutritous breakfast. We can taste the grain, yet it's very light and filling. I was just browsing through the grocery section and stumbled on this item. It is a very pleasant surprise, Even if you don't usually like whole grain wheat or oats (like me) its great. Only 2 grams of sugar."
Really Good ...,One of the things I really appreciate about these (good sized) three ounce bags of veggie sticks is the following:<br />Servings per container: 3<br />Calories per serving: 140<br /><br />They taste great and a one ounce serving is generous. They really are a good snack and a good value.
Just what I was looking for!,"My 5 month old is teething and putting everything in her mouth. She is simultaneously showing interest in food. I was looking for something that would satisfy all of her needs and this is it. Although this is made in China, I felt confident about buying it because it is organic. The crackers are crisp and textured so they provide teething relief. However,once they get really wet they dissolve, so there's no choking risk! This plus is also a minus because if your baby is messy and gets this everywhere, clean up before they dry because they dry like cement chips!"
kids love em,"This is tasty cereal, lightly sweetened, and gluten free. Great price here on subscribe and save. Also, arrives quickly and in perfect condition."
This product may contain silicon dioxide,"The label of this Taco Seasoning informs that this product may contain silicon dioxide. According to Wikipedia the chemical compound silicon dioxide, also known as silica (from the Latin silex), is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO2. It has been known for its hardness since antiquity. Silica is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz, as well as in the cell walls of diatoms. Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust in very small quantities (OSHA allows 0.1 mg/m3) over time can lead to silicosis, bronchitis, or cancer, as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates them, reducing lung capacities.<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN."
love this stuff,"I had been making all our baby food but we took a long cross-country driving trip and I knew there was no way to keep doing that. So, I did some research (i.e asking other parents  and found these. OUr little guys LOVES this food. He immediately ate an entire pouch, and since has eaten alot of it. It tastes like pear, and has lots of fiber."
"Great taste, addictive, snack or cereal - it's all good!",This cereal is a fave at our house. It can be a snack or a cereal. It has a nice appealing texture which does stay crispy with milk longer than flake type or other shredded grain type products. It is sweet but not sugary. We find it very satisfying. Not sure I notice any brown sugar taste - but as noted it is sweeter than plain grain cereal.<br /><br />Oats seem like a heart healthy concept - I'm not entirely sure that the processing of said oats into this cereal makes it healthy but then we alternate it with real oatmeal so it is not a daily meal for us. It does seem to go quickly as it is easy to eat a bigger bowl than the serving so we have to watch that.<br /><br />We also (contrary to the cover) do not like this with fruit unless the fruit is slightly tart. It makes it too sweet. So for those strawberries or other berries that have a more sour than sweet taste this is ideal. For fruits like banana's or sweet blueberries it was just too much sweet for us.
My Husky loves it!,"We used to give my Husky this food until the local pet store stopped carrying it. We switched to another brand she would eat it, but she wasn't happy. After finding it on Amazon, we switched back to Diamond Performance and my Husky is a happy girl again!"
Great drink at a bad price!!!,I live in Southern Oregon and can get these cans for $1.19 each for a daily price or I can get an additional 10% off for buying it by the case. $25 for 12 cans is NOT a good deal and if you contact the company directly to find out who sells it near you your bound to get it cheaper than this... I buy mine from Market of Choice in Ashland Oregon and absolutely love it!!! It gets me moving in a much smoother way than caffeine/high fructose corn syrup based drinks. Working construction its important for me to NOT fight the drink Im using. Taste is somewhere between Mountain Dew and Sprite. Lightly carbonated and best when ice cold. Love the drink but would NEVER buy it at this price!!!
Special K fruit crisp. YUM,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006W5WH5S"">Special K Fruit Crisps, Strawberry, 10-Count Bars (Pack of 4)</a>Purchased these for a drive in the morning breakfast food with coffee. Love them. They taste like mini-poptarts for adults. Great try them. Only 100 calories."
So delicious!,"I worked in a coffee shop and I drank this stuff non-stop.  It is so good.  I would make it with soymilk - its great hot or cold.  I didn't really like it with water - almost all our customers got it with milk or soymilk.  It doesn't taste sugar-free at all.  It's delicious, not artificial sweetner taste.  Right now, Amazon is listing this for $36 but plenty of websites offer it for less than $30."
"Quick, easy, and delicious","This falafel kit has saved me many times. I always buy a few boxes and forget that I have it. Then, when I run out of groceries and I'm rifling through the cabinets for something tasty to eat, there it is! Falafel! Sometimes I eat it by itself, on a pita, or with crumbled spicy tofu."
Great Tasting,These chips are great tasting!  You have to try them if you like sweet potatoes.
Love It,"My puppy is pretty finicky about her treats. But, she absolutely loves these.  It's a great value to boot for the price.  An added bonus is that it's made in the USA for those concerned about product safety."

Very Good,"I would prefer if they didn't include the Jasmine flowers, the slightly flowery aroma doesn't appeal to me.  Otherwise this is an excellent tea.  The taste is good and as it says, it is not bitter.  The flavor is not really ""mild"". (some teas have tasted like warm water, this tea definitely has flavor and brews surprisingly dark)<br /><br />With this type of high quality tea, I do recommend following the brewing directions exactly (185 degree water, 4 to 5 minutes steep time).<br /><br />I use purified water to make this, and add some honey, a half dozen drops of lemon juice and a quarter teaspoon of vitamin C.  The result is excellent."
PG Tips Tea,"This was a great deal on tea. My grocery store quit carrying it, and I was forced to order it. However, there was a silver lining because it was a great deal. We paid much less for this than we had been paying at the grocery for the small containers (that was all that was offered). I am storing it in a giant glass jar, and it works well. We drink tea every day and go through it quickly."
"Great for ""on the go""","It's nice to have a healthier option for ""on the go"" snacks for my 15 month old.  Snacks are generally fresh fruits or vegetables but they are too messy for the car so these are a good alternative.  She LOVES sweet potatoes so I thought she'd really love these but they don't have much flavor (yes I tried one).  They are good size for her little fingers and easy to handle."
So good who needs wheat,Best product we have tasted for people with celiac disease!  I make these for my husband who can't eat wheat but they are so good I have a hard time keeping my 4 kids from eating Dads treats
My dogs love them!,My babies really love these.  The only problem is that they are easily crushed.  Shipping always seems to make about half the biscuits into little pieces.  The dogs like them anyway but it is harder to know if you are giving too much to them.
HANDS DOWN FAVORITE INSTANT COFFEE I ALWAYS COME BACK TO,"This great instant expresso is truly sensational & in a class by itself !! What makes this so special is not only the fabulous taste, but its powdered form, making it versatile for baking, making truffles, chocolates, and is easily blended in iced coffee beverages. I have tried many other instant expresso coffees and the others are mostly freeze dried, so the taste is not as good & it does not blend well in iced coffees or as versatile for baking or truffle making. It is reasonably priced on Amazon & I go into withdrawal without my Medaglia D'Oro !"
Happy Dogs!,"My dogs get a variety of rawhide bones, from dingo's to the generic Wal-Mart rawhides. My German Shepherd and Boxer love<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZF06JI"">Green Cow Rawhide Dog Bones, Natural Chips, 5-Pound Bag</a> rawhide bones and with the costs of these bones skyrocketing, I was looking for a bulk pack that was affordable. I found it in the Green Cow listing here on Amazon. We ordered, and it arrived, very surprisingly, the next day. The good news is that this is a large bag and most of all, has not upset the sensitive stomach of my 120lb big GSD baby and my sweetie Boxer is very happy with her new treats.  I have recommended this product to friends and family and will be ordering on a regular basis."
what I get is not England kit kat,what I get is not England kit kat but kit kat made in germany and  and there is a huge deferent in taste so there is kind of cheat in this item
"Starts off weak, gets worse","The back of the bag tells you to use two tablespoons or coffee for every 6 ounces of water when brewing this coffee. I did that, and the vanilla taste was very weak. This is strange, because my ground floor smelled strongly of vanilla after brewing, but you would not have known that from tasting the coffee itself.<br /><br />Since I had a week to use it after opening, I made it again and again each morning. With each passing day, the coffee would taste worse. Just the other day, I made some for a road-trip to the in-laws. My wife took a sip and said ""oh, that's bad,"" and never touched it again. Yep, there was something about this coffee that just did not jive. At all. I'm sorry Starbucks, I have nothing against you, this coffee was just a big disappointment."
Didn't catch a single moth,"I bought 3 boxes of these moth traps, baited them per the instructions, and placed them in the bedrooms, closets, laundry room--everywhere I've seen clothes moths. After a week, the traps remain empty, but there are still moths fluttering around. I am making headway against them, but no thanks to the traps."
Great for training,My schnauzer loves these treats. They're healthy and great for training. He also loves the peanut butter flavor. Highly recommended.
Yummy,"If you like the original Chicago Mix by Garrett from Chicago, this comes pretty close! Love the sweet and salty mix of cheddar and caramel popcorn."
Caution - may cause kitty stampede,"I called upon a panel of two expert feline food testers assist me with this review.  The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings."
"So far, no go","My cat is in the early stages of renal failure and I bought this as part of my efforts to find an appropriate food he would eat.  Unfortunately I've offered this product twice and it was tried for a mouthful and later ignored.  Interestingly, I also have a young cat (formal feral) and even this former dumpster-diver sniffed and walked.  I will continue to offer this and hope it catches on eventually.<br /><br />There are other products for the condition but this one seemed to be the most palatable from reviews.  There also seems to be some controversy over whether a cat in early stages of kidney failure should be fed a low protein or low phosphorus diet.  Further, there seems to be an issue in later stages with cats losing weight and not wanting to eat, and I am not sure if a food like this would encourage eating.  One day at a time.<br /><br />So here I am with the smallest amount one could buy (24 cans).  If this food doesn't get a decent reception soon, I will probably donate it to my vet's office for other sick cats to try.  If you've got an ill kitty, and you've been told to try a low protein/phosphorus food, it can't hurt to do lots of reading and try this, but no miracles in my household just yet!<br /><br />Update March 2010 - It's been 1 and 1/2 years since I wrote the above review.  Your vet advice and results may vary, but my cat has done very well on a normal diet since then.  After doing much reading and talking with our vet, special foods are not yet called for for my cat.  Have your cat's blood levels checked to see if they are doing ok with phosphorous and you and your vet can decide from there if food like this is advisable.  It may be better to discuss if your cat can stay on regular food and use a phosphorous blocker.<br /><br />More and more I am reading that weight loss is a problem for cats in kidney failure so keeping the food desirable to them could be a big deal.  My cat is having more issues with the accompanying hyperthyroidism than with the kidney disease currently, and while he has indeed lost some weight, his blood tests are showing he's doing pretty well."
Good morning cup of joe,"Great cup of morning coffee.  This is a very rich, flavorful coffee.  I am a tea drinker, but like my coffee on a chillier day, and since we've been plagued with cold weather here in the Northeast, I've been enjoying alot of coffee in the mornings!  That being said, I usually brew up a Keurig K-Cup of Donut people coffee (great coffee as well), but decided to go a full week with Caffe Lungo.  I'm happy to report that it is great!  Tastes like fresh brewed coffee from the pot or from the store.  I loved the flavor as much as my beloved Donut people coffee.  Very nice cup of coffee indeed.  My only problem is that Nescafe isn't easy to find where I am and therefore I have to order on Amazon.  Not that it is a problem to order, but I would like to be able to pick one up localy when I run out."
Love it more than the ghiradelli white chocolate,Bought the ghiradelli white chocolate first for making white chocolate mochas.  Bought this second and then a 3rd.  Little more expensive but like the taste better.
"If you like almond-flavored granola, this is for you!","I absolutely love the flavor of these granola bars, and have them on my Subscribe and Save list!  With the discount, they average out to just under $2.50 a box.  They're great for tossing into a totebag or backpack, and eating on the go, or at home, for breakfast or a quick snack!  If you love the flavor of almonds, and the crunchiness of granola, you'll surely be quite pleasantly satisfied with these"
Very tasty,"this was a different twist on Broccoli and cheese, but was very easy to prepare.<br /><br />I did think the sauce was salty.  You do not need to add any spice or salt to the dish."
Great!,This is very good product for people trying to get rid of bad bacteria naturally! Take 3 tbs a day.
Pinnacle - Limited Ingredient,"I received the recommendation as a more natural healthy alternative to the more commercialized brands of avoderm, royal canine , and others.That have either reduced the quality of there food over time or bought out by larger pet food companies and drastically change the formuls. I was very pleased to have changed considering my english bulldog started to get allegies from those other foods. Her allergies eased dramatically once i started her on the Pinnacle. I find the food to be substantially better in quality and ingredient structure and heriarchy of the elements contained within. i find it equally comparable to Halo and Lonovo. The only negative is that if your dog has yeast problems inside and out then this product delivers its fair share of sugars(Carbs) from the potatoes which help fuel the yeast. i used for several months and would recommend to other dogs without yeast problems. good luck but, trying many types and finding the one that works is the best strategy."
Can't live without it,"I am a mom of two boys under two years old.  I rarely have time to sit and drink a whole cup of coffee, so I ordered the espresso.  At first it was just for the caffiene, but I was so surprised that it actually tasted smoother and less bitter than the Dolce Gusto Cafe Americano!  I love it, it is delicious, and sometimes I add it to the Caramel Macchiatto for an extra kick.<br /><br />My only complaint of using pods is that the used pods leak in my trash can.  I have to squeeze out the excess water from the pods so my trash bag doesn't leak all over my kitchen floor when taking it outside."
a must when making stew.,"I always used this in making beef stew combined with lipton onion gravy mix. My local store don't carry this and as always amazon save my day. In every box there is 2 packs of mix. Now, I know where to find it next time I run out of it. Thanks amazon."
Love it!,"I love that there are so few kernels left unpopped in my Whirly Pop. The popcorn itself pops up small, but is delicious! Another plus is that the hulls don't get caught in your teeth."
dog chew review,"great veggieDent Chews, suggested by our vet.  No mess, OK for dogs with sensitive stomaches and bladder stones.  And, most important, the dogs loved them."
Chewy and Satisfying,"Whole grain ingredients and good tasting.  Most Kashi products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains, but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix. It's nice to have a treat that is more nutritious and still sweet enough for my sweet tooth!  There are several varieties of Kashi cookies, and they are all good."
Fabulous dough!,"Everything you need for a classic Italian pizza. Now if I can just master the dough-tossing in the air, the whole fabulous Rossi Pizza dough experience will be complete!"
DE-lish!,"I don't even remember where or when I bought this tea or if someone gave it to me, but I finally tried it and was totally blown away.  Did you know that bergamot is a type of sour orange?  When you smell the tea knowing that the scent is citrus, you can distinguish it but I didn't figure it out on my own.<br /><br />Anyway, oil of bergamot is what makes Earl Grey tea something different from just plain tea.  The DOUBLE bergamot is what makes this particular Earl Grey tea a new taste experience (at least for me).<br /><br />Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Earl Grey tea:<br />[...]"
Carrie,This coffee was very good. You could taste the chocolate in the coffee and smell it in the air. Def a favorite!
love this product,"between the kitchen and the therapy room, i use this product often...<br />nutiva is offering a quality oil and amazon's price is good"
Delicious tea!,"I love this tea. And not being a fan of tea in general, that's saying something. It's flavorful without being overpowering or juice-like, and has a delightful aroma. Perfect for early evenings."
"Very, very strong ginger flavor","You have to love ginger to like this product. It's not a ginger-flavored drink, it's a ginger drink.<br /><br />I admit, i only like ginger, i don't love it. I found the flavor to be too strong, and too bitter. I had to add a fair amount of sugar to make it drinkable. Never once did i notice any lemon flavor.<br /><br />As with most drinks, it's going to be up to each individual to decide if they like it. Ginger-philes will probably love it, ginger-haters should stay well clear, and people somewhere in between might like it with a bit of honey or sugar."
Great for Summer Iced Tea Lovers!,"I am new to brewing iced tea at home, and I must say, Luzianne tea is fantastic for this very purpose.  The flavor profile is not too robust, but not weak.  It's a perfect balance of black tea that will leave you wanting more!  I use subscribe and save and take advantage of the great price.<br /><br />Some people use home brewers, but they take all the fun out of tea making.  I've adopted the below strategy for the perfect cup of iced tea.<br /><br />Place six cups of tap water in a pot.  Pour 2/3 cup of sugar into the pot, and then bring this simple syrup to a rolling boil, with an occasional stir.  When you reach the rolling boil, steep three of the family sized teabags for about 10 seconds, then remove from heat.  Allow the bags to sit in the pot for 5-10 minutes.  Use a wooden spoon to squeeze any remaining tea out of the bags, and discard.  Allow your tea concentrate to cool to room temperature.  Pour six cups of fresh water into an empty gallon jug (preferably glass, but BPA free plastic works as well).  Then, pour your tea concentrate into the same jug.  You now have delicious iced tea - refrigerate, and serve with ice and a wedge of lemon!  Variations: 1 cup of sugar for southern sweet, 1/4 cup of sugar for sunkissed sweet, or no sugar at all if you like unsweetened tea.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
Wonderful Treats for training,Just have to say that the treats are great for training. They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day. I choose peanut butter just because I know my dog loves it and we don't have to get really messy with something like a kong or anything. The overall training has been going really well with these as I can take a handful and have more than enough left for each training session. I will say that the one thing is that they are small enough that you sometimes worry that the dog is going to bite your hand and not the treat so make sure to palm feed your dog and not try to pinch the food between two fingers.
i'm hooked!,"I got a free sample of these once, and now--we're on the subscribe and save program.  Not much of a chip fan, I love the slight spiciness of these (from the pepper) and the exploded texture of the chip.  It's so nice they're not greasy, and they manage to hit those little salty + crunchy cravings that hit everyonce in a while!  Definitely recommended."
Great Bold Taste,"Love this coffee, it is robust and strong.  Highly recommend for those who like a strong, full bodied coffee."
Very disappointing product,"Bought this under the influence of many positive reviews.  I'm sorry to say that I found this produce upalatable, unacceptable.  It manages to be both insipid and bitter, leaves a nasty aftertaste, and has none of the mouthfeel of peanut butter. I'm returning it right away."
Awful,This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.
Lingham's Original Hot Sauce,"Lingham's Hot Sauce ""Original"" is my absolute favorite everyday hot sauce, it is a perfect combination of sweet followed with spicy addition to Chinese food, eggs, or anything that needs a kick in the flavor department. I was introduced to this product as a young boy when my family would take me into LA's China Town for Dim Sum and we would go to the Asian Market for supplies for the the meals Mom would fix at home. I was able to buy it at CostPlus World Market for a period of time but they stopped carrying it. My other source, a local Asian Market I used to also get it at went out of business and I was down to the last of my stash when I did a product search on Amazon and found suppliers. If you want a sweet heat without that vinegar after taste this the product for you."
Nasty taste,"Got this as a gag gift which was great for that purpose. However, I made the mistake of actually trying this. It was awful! Still, it served its purpose. My husband no longer thinks that EVERYTHING is better with bacon! LOL"
Love this hot cereal,"This was my favorite hot cereal as a kid and I always asked for it for breakfast.  Can't find it anywhere in the grocery stores and was getting tired of oatmeal and not really into ""cream of wheat"" and sure enough found my ""Zoom"" on Amazon.  I love it with some cinnamon and real butter.  My husband is even eating it with me and he is a big oatmeal guy so maybe he was ready for a change too."
A great little snack for junk food junkies!,"My son can consume the whole box in two days! Great price for a quick snack...maybe it's not the healthy food I would like to see him eat, but it makes him happy! And I don't really let him eat the whole box in 2 days!"
My Cat LOVES this!,I have a male cat who's 12 who has to be on a grain-free diet or he breaks out (like his mom!) :)<br />He also doesn't drink enough water so this moist food encourages him to eat (he's PICKY) and is good to his system.  He likes this much better than some of the other brands we tried.
a bread that works,"This bread has a great flavor. One of the biggest things is the way the dough handles. There are some things that should be noted.<br /><br />The first is to add at at least a tablespoon of rapid rise yeast to it. The packet is fine but it takes a long time to rise. The second is the water. the amount is CRITICAL. Third is the mixing. when the mix gets thick look for the stringers from the ball of dough to the pan. The mixing is done. Spray the mix in the bread pan with a spray canola oil or something. the purpose is to seal the dough so it will rise correctly.<br /><br />I am thinking about cutting the water back slightly and dumping the finished mix onto a large ""commercial"" type of baking sheet. I want to make a large french loaf.<br /><br />The result is a high rise ""commercial"" type of loaf. It looks like wheat bread and works like wheat bread. I have been looking for a mix like this for a long time."
carameliscious,"I know the directions say to measure it out but I've yet to do that I just kinda dump it in the pan with the popping oil and toss a handful of popcorn in and start cranking on the good old whirlypop.  I get tasty caramel popcorn every time, rarely do I get a burned issue but then I'm diligent about cranking the handle so I would guess if I slacked off, I'd have a black stinky mess that would be a pain to clean out of my popcorn popper.  I find it just as good as some stuff I had gotten with the whirlypop in the first place that I can't seem to get anymore.  I find if I dump the popcorn out into the bowl and immediately set my whirlypop in the sink with hot water and a squirt of dawn dishsoap and let is soak for a half hour it wipes out easily.  I've yet to burn anything so I can't say what happens if you scorch the coating to the pan, but its delicious. go buy some. your tummy will thank you."
Surprisingly delicious!,"Wow, these are really good!  At first, I didn't understand ""Popchips"", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.  The Popchips are very different from that!<br /><br />These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air-popped, very light like popcorn.  Texture-wise, they remind me of ""Munchos"" only lighter and without the oily feel and taste.  Remember Munchos?  These are WAY better.<br /><br />Next thing - the flavor from the sweet potatos is YUMMY!  I know when I first read ""rice flour"" in the ingredients, I was thinking those cardboard-like rice cakes.  The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw ""0.8 ounce"", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!  Not that 0.8 is a big bag, or ""filling"" or anything like that, but the bag is just the right size, which is a very pleasant surpise to me!  I finish the last chips, like the last of the salt from my fingers, and I feel satisfied - like, wow, that was tasty and just right!  At Amazon's prices, I believe I will be buying these regularly!"
Great tea,"I've been drinking this tea since last summer. Along with exercise and watching what I eat, I've lost 36 lbs. so far. I find I'm not as hungry  between meals when I drink the tea. I drink it iced with splenda."
I love this tea.,"I love this green chai tea.  It tastes great, does not have a heavy tannic taste, unless you leave it in the water for more than 10 minutes and it is light and flavorful. Because it is green tea, it does not stain your teeth as regular black tea does.  I drink this nearly every morning sweetened with honey and it is wonderful."
"So far so good, but you will need to purchase more nutes","Product states you can harvest after 3 weeks and keep harvesting for four months, but only enough nutes for 2 months.<br /><br />Liquid nutes come need to m]be mixed well before used because some nutes turned into a solid in the corner in the small bag.<br /><br />Will update as time goes on."
"Need fiber? Try this tasty, crunchy cereal.","Kashi makes some great whole-grain cereals (U is the best!!) and the GOLEAN Crunch Honey Almond Flax is one of the better varieties. Very, very crunchy with and excellent blend of nutty goodness and sweet honey. It's great with Silk Light vanilla soy milk."
"Love the oil, love the price!","I have been using Colavita for years. It is one of the finest all around X-Virgin olive oils on the market. Its extremely fruity and works very well in salads and pasta dishes. I have been struggling with olive oils since I can not find it in the stores where I now live. Now I get it shipped to my door, with free freight, and at a lower price than I used to pay in the grocery store."
Suprisingly yummy...great texture!,"My daughter wanted to try these because she used to love jerky type snacks prior to becoming vegetarian. I have tried other brands of veggie snacks similar to these so I did not have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! These are yummy! Great texture & flavor. Great ingredients too! We will be stocking up on these as a healthy, convenient protein packed snack."
Best Gluten Free Bread!,"My son has several allergies and finding a gluten free bread that does not have egg, nuts, soy, or corn in it has been a challenge.  The other challenge has been finding something that actually tastes like bread.  This product has been wonderful!!  The bread can be made by hand or in a breadmaker and has the recipe to use with egg replacer.  The consistancy and texture is the most ""bread like"" I have ever found and the taste is fabulous!!"
these are great,"these are great, good as a soup, in chili, as baked beans, a side or in vegetable soup"
"Like the results, hate the package, a little misleading","This is one of the thickest shampoos I have ever seen. I can wash my hair and let it sit for several minutes without it running into my eyes. I have not experienced any of the problems others complain about, and it does a great job cleaning my hair. The labeling is misleading, as it proclaims that it will ""nourish the scalp"" and more. With an *. The * states that you need to use the conditioner as well. So what exactly are the benefits of the shampoo alone?<br /><br />So as a shampoo, it works great. Anything else? Who knows."
NO CRAP fillers or junk ingredients AND Made in USA,"One jar is a 30-60 day supply for your dog. 60 days if your dog is 25lbs or less. The instructions give weight ranges from dogs under 10lbs to over 75lbs. It says for maximum benefit to double usage the first 4-6 weeks. For freshness after opening, keep in the refrigerator. No fillers, sugar, artificial colors, preservatives, sodium, wheat, corn or soy.<br /><br />This powder comes in a plastic jar that is halfway full -- not sure if it settled during shipping but it's always a disappointment to open something (like potato chip bags) and find it's not quite full. Despite my initial impression, it seems that this is a really good product. It  is made by the same company that makes the vitamins that I take myself.<br /><br />My dog didn't seem to interested in it -- he sniffed it and walked away and then came back later and ate his food. It says it's salmon flavor but it smells a little chocolate-y to me.<br /><br />I've used other treat type supplements and my dog gets really gassy. I'm hoping this is more gentle on his stomach. I'll update after we've used this product for a while."
"Tastes good, but is not a ""cure-all""","I got this product to help my daughter's skin condition.  She gets very slow to heal sores all over her body.  I thought that this product might kick in her immune system to fight them off.  Upon taking it, her current sores weren't healing and she got some new ones.  I am having her finish out the bottle (it was expensive and can't hurt), but I won't be buying her another one.<br /><br />On the other hand, it does appear to be 100% Goji juice as advertised and not some sort of cocktail mix."
reednikki71@yahoo.com,I live in Alaska and prices are very exspensive I saved alot money ordering this product and will be ordering again soon.
Neat new more enviromentally friendly K-Cup Option,"I was initially shocked when I initially opened my parcel and found these very cool new San Francisco Bay Coffee Organic One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 80-Count. First this is a great value at $33.00 including free shipping with my Prime Account. For those of you who have not tried Prime membership it pays for itself in between 60-90 days with moderate use and I believe Amazon still offers a 30 day free trial which is worth looking at to experience the benefits. I've had my membership for 3 years and its a great value! Enough for the the Amazon commercial back to the coffee. Price per cup is the lowest I have found anywhere at just under 42 cents. The normal K-cups are all plastic while these have a plastic ring with a fiber filter bag. Its not 100% recyclable but its a big step forward as the filter will break down quickly and the coffee grounds will then fall out allowing those to decompose as well. That leaves a small plastic ring (which looks recyclable) and foil top left. To assist to keep your coffee fresh you receive a reusable lightweight recyclable plastic tub with an airtight lid that holds about 8 K-cups for peak freshness. In addition each 8 K-Cups is sealed in a vented recyclable bag inside the box so you open one and put them in the storage tub after. Nice touch.<br /><br />This is a robust organic coffee with a smooth finish, its gives me above average caffeine buzz, please note I am not big coffee drinker, more a 1-2 good cups a day guy and I like to have variety, thus my move to a Keurig system (which I love and have spread this to 6 others in my family as well as many at my office). Thi is a good coffee with nice flavor and I also like the fact its organic, a little more recyclable and a good value. A++++"
Excellent Gum!,"I read a lot of negative reviews on this gum, but I think it's great.  The flavor is excellent and it last a long time, longer than most gums.  I am a huge fan of the Trident Splash gum, but the only flavor sold in stores in my area is the Strawberry with Lime, so it's nice to have a different flavor.  Yes, the price is high for gum, but I was willing to pay a higher price to get something I desired and it was worth the cost."
OH so Gooooooood,"I have two dogs and they really love Better Than Ears Peanut Butter (BTEPB). At about 6 every evening they run into the spare room where I keep the Ears and they speak and ask of their evening treat I have 4 different bags of treats there so I show them the bags and each evening they want the BTEPB they eat one and go have a drink of water and off to sleep land they go its really great. I can really tell how happy they are OH So Gooooooooooooooooood.<br /><br />The wonderful part also is they are made in the USA and the price is affordable<br /><br />Great Treat, Great Price, and Great Made in the USA, NO Mess<br /><br />I am so happy that I get a bag or two every month. With no worry about running out. Reordered goes though (automatically) This is another great thing."
Great flavor in no time at all,"I got tired of grinding beans in the morning and I discovered this Via, it's a revelation, great tasting coffee in an instant without the""instant coffee flavor "" disappointment."
Pleseantly Surprised,"Admitedly, I can be closed-minded when I see food with the words ""sugar-free"", ""low-carb"", ""Heart Smart"", etc...I know there are good-tasting products out there with these words in the title (I prefer diet soda and Crystal Light to surgared drinks), but if I see the above words on anything else, psychologically I shut down. I actually bought these to make for a pot luck that included diabetic colleagues and in a period of open-mindedness, made some for my family. Not. Bad.<br /><br />I sprinkled chopped pecans on top before baking - they smelled great cooking, looked good cooling off. I stared hard at the brownies before cutting myself a piece and...wait for it; I was pleseantly surprised! In fact, they were so good that I helped myself to another slice, but after the 2nd helping I could taste whatever sweetener subsitute they use. Fine by me - this will ensure I don't overload in a moment of weakness.<br /><br />My husband stuck them in the fridge and while still good, they take on a more fudge-like texture. We both thought they tasted like Little Debbie Brownies. He loves them! I glad I trusted the reviews on Amazon and wanted to share my own thoughts for other skeptics like me. If you would like to find ways to reduce your sugar intake without living without chocolate, I recommend these (but just one serving!). Enjoy!"
"GREAT TASTING, GREAT PRICE!","THESE ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER MAJOR BRAND VARIETY PACK. MUCH BETTER OUTER LAYER, LESS ""GRAINY"" FEELING IN TEXTURE + TASTE. THE FILLING IS TASTIER ALSO. I'LL DEFINITELY BUY THESE AGAIN BUT NOT THE ""GRAINY"" BRAND."
This isn't the real stuff,"Let me say that I love Schultz Plant Food.  I have used Schultz All Purpose Plant Food for many years, and this stuff that I just got from Amazon isn't the real stuff.  It's almost clear to light green in color.  The real stuff is dark green.  When I add 7 drops to water, I should see the dispersion of plant food like waves, but this one is so light that I can't see anything.  I am going to return this if I can."
cheap and best product,I've been using this for awhile in my iced tea. Before this I was buying artificially sweetened iced tea by the gallon. Now I make my own tea by the half gallon. This is SO much cheaper and more convenient and just as good. I wish I'd tried it a long time ago.
Dark & Delicious :),"This is a great chocolate to let melt in your mouth, slowly, and just savor for the sake of chocolate - nothing else.  It might be too dark for some, as there is very little sweetness, but a little at a time is perfect. The children as well as the adults enjoyed this; it arrived fresh, and well packaged."
colorful!,"The colors came out very nice. The only issue I had was with ""no taste"" red. I had trouble getting to the dark red I wanted and had to use a lot of dye. Other than that the cake came out beautiful!"
Very disappointed,"I was so happy to see the great review on these pills that I threw caution aside and purchased a significant quantity of two flavors for personal use. I wanted to have extra for passing around to my friends. I eagerly tasted my coffee with the flavored pills; absent of carbohydrates, great for chocolate and caramel lovers. To my dismay, even with two pills, my coffee was still lack-luster. Neither the chocolate nor the caramel tasted like the real thing, just another ho hum imitation flavor assimilation lacking quality for the taste buds. In my opinion, these pills are not worth buying. This is too bad because such care went into the packaging. If the product had half the class the packaging does,I would purchase their product for my coffee shop."
Is this even coffee?,"I usually brew a Lg setting cup and the first time I tried Veranda, it tasted like a coffee flavored Chai. Extremely weak coffee. For people who don't enjoy coffee. And of course, WAY over priced. Why is starbux almost 5 dollars more than all the other brands? In this economy? Guess he really needs the cash to fund more illegal settlements. The weakest coffee I've ever had. Horrible.<br /><br />Whats more? Theres a starbax on a corner not far from my house (go figure)...and it's amusing to see the lemmings line up around the building to pay $5 for a cup of coffee, when 3 blocks over is a small mom & pop Cuban grocery (family owned) that makes the best Cuban coffee this side of the everglades, made fresh to order. Not a soul in the parking lot, I jump out ask for a grande con leche with sugar. It's 16Oz. for $1, and not a penny goes to fund any illegal settlements in Palestine."
Numi teapot and blossoms,I love my little teapot and the tea blossoms that came with it. It came in a bamboo box that is lovely and well made. I would recommend this for anyone who loves novelty tea products.
Factory seconds,I have happily used Health Valley products for as long as the company has existed.<br /><br />My problem is not with the company or the product but rather with Amazon's shop. I have ordered cases of the beef broth twice from Amazon and both times at least 50% of the cans were significantly damaged. Its as if I was being sold factory seconds. But at a premium retail price. I am very reluctant to buy again because I feel that I am being abused by Amazon's distributor.
Great Coffe,"We love the Newman's Special Blend roast from Green Mountain.  Not too bold, but very rich flavor.  Nice middle of the road roast.  Highly recommend it."
trusted brand...,"We trust Beneful and these days with so many scary stories about dogs getting sick from treats or dog food that is made in China, it is very important to trust. My dog always has an appetite for Beneful. She's been eating it for years and still devours it. I love this 15.5 lb. bag. We just keep it in the garage and scoop it out when it's din-din time. An airtight seal keeps it fresh."
Yummy!,"If you haven't tried these cookies with a glass of milk, you haven't lived!  I bought them in a small grocery in Washington, DC while I was there on business.  I saved the wrapper, googled them and then bought them through Amazon.  Quick service, product was fresh and now I am happy.  Caution, they are addicting so only let yourself have one or two at a time - not the whole box."
A great way to add lots of flavor!,I love this seasoning. It's nice and spicy without being pure heat. Tastes great and goes a long way. I love using it when making my own taco seasoning.
Lives up to its name,"I'm in the latter months of pregnancy and it is becoming harder and harder to get a good nights sleep. In lieu of not being able to find my go-to Chamomile at the grocery, I reached for Bedtime Story since in the tag line it expressed being Caffeine Free and made with Real Spearmint and Chamomile Flowers. I was curious what the Spearmint would be like with the Chamomile so I scooped Lipton Bedtime Story with plans to make a cup that night.<br /><br />Upon opening the box, I was hit with the tingly scent of Spearmint. I brewed a cup, curiously wondering if the tea would be more minty than I wanted. After letting it steep for a few minutes, I added my favorite accompaniments and sipped. Delicious. It's a soft, relaxing blend of Chamomile. The Spearmint is not overpowering like I had worried it might be. The ingredients listed are Spearmint Leaves, Chamomile Flowers, Peppermint Leaves, Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, Spice, Chicory Root. I would say that along with the Chamomile and Mint flavors, the Chicory Root, stands out a bit, giving the tea a hint of earthiness.<br /><br />Bedtime Story definitely relaxed my body and I've been sleeping like a baby (pun intended) ever since."
Rooibos tee,"I though the flavor was very weak, need to use 2 pods to get the strength I usually have with loose leaf. Will go back to brewing in my 2 cup tea pot.<br />Deliver of tea was timely. Thank you!"
Great Alternative to Hydrated Coconut Water,"I have tried several types of coconut water since it helps treat my stomach ulcer condition. This stuff is better than all but one product as far as taste but comparable to even that one (VC). However, this is so much cheaper and it takes up less area to store (yes, I use that much)! They recommend adding 1tbsp to 8oz of water but to adjust to desires taste. I highly recommend trying this product!"
A little taste of home ... I still love McVities Digestives,"If you want a tea biscuit or should I know say cookie - then look no further than these british mcvities digestives<br />Very addictive, once you start, hence I buy 6 packs!<br />I just wish the chocolate digestives did not cost so much as I would buy some of them too!<br />Great cookie for after meal treat, my kids love 'em"
nice flavor,Some of these green teas have a funky flavor but I quite like this one.
"Tender & delicious organic, and super fast shipping!!! Great for Air-Poppers!","Great for air-popping machines! Popcorn kernels pop into tender pieces. This is my third time ordering!  Speediest shipping all 3 times, and I only selected ""Free Super-Saver Shipping""."
"Good, but not as good as the last time....","My order arrived on time.  I bought this for friends at work.  It was good, as far as taste, but this time the licorice was a bit harder than usual.  What always got me about Lucky Country Licorice was the soft texture, but this time I was disappointed that it seemed a bit hard."
"Really Nice, Great Deal","From previous reviews I worried about huge variations in size, while there some different sizes (which is good), there are very few scrapy pieces. Quality looks very good, super deal, for a little more than you would pay for 2 pounds at Walmart, you get 5 pounds of better chips"
Best frozen hot chocolate ever,I watched Oprah and learned about this chocolate.  I ordered some online.  For Christmas we had it instead of our regular hot chocolate.  WOW!  Absolutely fantastic and easy to make.
Best Brown Rice Ever...,"Very tasty brown rice.  Cooks nicely, very fragrant and has a good texture.  Don't know why anyone would want to eat white rice after trying this."
Stash Teas,"I discovered Stash Teas with the receipt of a gift basket.  I was so impressed with the robust flavors and aromas that I searched out their product line and bought several larger boxes (100 bags per box0.  While I have found limited selections in one supermarket, the online choices were far wider.  These are great teas.  Have fun brewing."
FEWER COLUMBOLLA MITES W/ FLEA TRAPS,IM INFESTED W/COLUMBOLLA MITES. I WAS SPENDING $400.00 @ MONTH FOR SPRAY SO I COULD SLEEP A FEW HOURS W/OUT BITES FORCING ME OUT OF BED. SINCE USING FLEA TRAPS I NOW BUY $200.00 WORTH OF SPRAY.
not to crazy,"Love green mountain coffee, but the breakfast blend was not strong or bold enough for me, will try stronger and bolder ones and get back to you all with another review, thanks"
Very Yummy,Sent these to my son in college sine they are his favorite variety of Pringles.  He loved getting them and said they arrived in good condition.
Cute,These are really good and arrive fresh.  The only thing is cookie monster doesn't have a nose.  The adults didn't notice (to be honest I didn't either) it was my 2 year old nephew that pointed that out to me.  Other then that they were perfect. :)
Cardia Salt,"My husband likes the taste and consistency of this product.  And he is very particular about his 'salt', so that is quite a compliment"
Nice China Green Tea,"The price currently on Amazon is a bit higher than I'm used to spending at my local Asian market, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy it if I couldn't get it locally. This Chinese-style green tea is not very bitter (as green tea can be) and has a pleasing taste. Being certified organic is a big plus and one of the reasons I keep buying this brand."
"Safe, and EFFECTIVE","I recently gave up my major 20 year Diet Coke addiction.  I did it for a number of reasons.  I typically wake VERY early to hit the gym before work & needed something to help me wake up at 4:30 AM.  This product is GREAT.  No over-stimulation as it only has the caffeine equivalent of 1 cup of jo. It is also SUGAR FREE and has 0 Net Carbs!! I do feel the energy quickly & it lasts the 5 hours it claims.  The berry flavor is pleasant, but tart so I drink some water as a ""chaser"" (no pun intended).  I drink water the rest of the day & only use 1 in the morning unless I have a ""late"" meeting scheduled."
The best,Makes it taste just like the popcorn you get at the movies. Dont need alot to do the job so this carton should last along time.
Pets Buster is ok,"We have only used the cube a couple of times, it works fine as far as the dog working a little harder at getting his food.  However, we cannont get the middle part to come out for cleaning.  Until we can get it to do that we will not use it very much."
Exellent product,"I love my Galangal powder from Whole Spice, use it in many recipes instead of black pepper since I cannot have black pepper. I like the economic bulk package from Whole Spice.  I keep a glass jar of the powder handy for cooking and refill it from the bag, as needed.  I do keep the open bag and the jar in the fridge but you may not have to do that."
HOORAY!,"I recently cut back on sugar, and have been using Stevia instead. I've been SEARCHING for flavored drink options that use Stevia instead of chemical sweeteners, because glycemic index is one of the things I'm focusing on. A friend told me about Stevita packs. I ordered one box of each flavor, and I love all of them! Lime is my absolute favorite. I gave up carbonation & cola 2 months ago, and I'm pretty picky about taste. A lot of ""healthy"" things I eat aren't my favorite, but these are awesome. If you're looking for a great flavor option for your water without chemical sweeteners...this is it!!!"
Great substitute for sugar filled carbonated beverages,"I discovered the best thing about drinking a carbonated beverage is the carbonation and not the ridiculous amounts of sugar added.  It is just as satisfying to drink plain carbonated water.  So far I have only tried the plain La Croix but am curious about the flavored ones.  I have no idea why they cost so much on Amazon, they are only 8 dollars a case at the local grocery store, so I don't recommend buying them here but check out your local stores maybe you can find La Croix or some similar product."
Not for me,"Definitely tastes like an artificially sweetened diet product.  It tastes like chocolate sauce for a second but the sharp aftertaste kicks in quickly after that.<br /><br />Personally, I will stick to a small serving of dark chocolate or yogurt with honey when I want something sweet but healthy."
Tasty lentil dish,"Normally I find lentils either too bland or way overspiced.  These are actually really good whenever you're in the mood for lentils.  I don't eat it as regularly as their chicken tikka masala, but it's a nice change whenever I do."
Cat treat,"I have 3 cats and that means there are 3 totally different<br />Personalities!<br />Momma kitty is a bit picky about treats, my baby manecoon is a total<br />Garbage disposal and eats most anything food related....<br />And now my ""Teenage"" kitty doesnt like tuna from a can,<br />She wont eat it...until I opened the package of this.....<br />She ate it! No fuss...no turning her nose up... No kidding, she are it! YAY!!<br /><br />Thank you."
Meh,"I use hot chocolate packets to stir into my coffee.  I normally use Land O'Lakes hot chocolate, but I've had trouble getting some of my favorite flavors, so I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bellagio Chocolate Truffle flavor, and I suppose that it gets the job done.  But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K-cup hot chocolate.  The flavor's a little flat, and the texture is pretty watery when compared to Land O'Lakes or even regular Swiss Miss.  I don't hate it, but there are better options out there, so I won't be ordering it again."
Decaf,Many times decaf ground coffee is not tasty.  This one is very good.  Even my daughter who usually drinks regular coffee enjoys this.
Great for diabetics,My father is diabetic and he uses this product a lot. It works well with maintaining his sugar levels
Terrible... the absolute worst!,"I love pretzels, but these were the absolute foulest things that ever entered my mouth... and trust me, I've eaten in foreign countries where everything is eaten.  I can not express enough how bad these are.  I ate one (or should I say chewed and spit out) and immediately threw out the entire 2.5lb bag."
great product -,Had to go on line to find buckwheat pancake mix.  None of the grocery stores in South Georgia carry buckwheat.  Glad I did.  I even used some of the mix to make walnut banana bread.
Excellent Choice,"These chews seem expensive when compared to other brands available, but judging from our dogs' reactions they are worth the price.  We never find them abandoned or buried in the flower beds.  They are chewed until they are gone."
Great,My dogs love these bones.  I bought all sizes.  My jack russel loves the big ones and the small ones.  My 60 pound mutt loves the big ones. They are great.  They are able to digest them and able to enjoy the bones.  I bought so many of them.  Petsmart for some reason discontinued them I was so upset.  I was so happy to see them on Amazon for a great price. I highly recommend them.
Delicious and Nutritious!,"My kids hate school lunch (can you blame them?). I feel good about sending them with these in their lunch boxes. Also, I like that they come in Aseptic cartons so there is no rush to use them before they expire like regular milk. The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is price--they are expensive. Costco used to sell these for a lot cheaper, but now the Costco in my area no longer carries them. I'm glad Amazon has them, I just wish they weren't so expensive."
Great product,I picked these up for my wife so she could make coffee out of any brand she likes. They work perfectly in her new Keurig that I got her for Christmas. You couldn't ask for better.
The oatmeal flavor is great for a wheat-restricted kid!,"My 3 year-old daughter and I need to avoid wheat-- but are not strictly gluten-free.  We also avoid all artificial sweeteners, corn syrup, etc.  These animal cookies are great.  She is able to bring them to school and eat them when the other kids have ""regular"" animal crackers and she is excited to be eating the same thing."
Excellent,Green Mountain Columbian K-Cup coffee tastes wonderfully smooth. Has the body of columbian coffees but not the strong after taste. It is truly a pleasure to drink and is my first choice for my K-Cup coffee maker.
Great Value,I purchased a Keurig single cup brewer for my elderly Mom and with that I sent her a large sample pack.  She pick the Breakfast Blend as her favorite.  This was a great deal so I sent it to her direct.  The K-Cups were all dumped in one box with not much packing protection.  I was sent an email from the company ahead of the delivery so I was aware and all was fine.
WOW! ADDICTING!,"these are some of the best caramels ever. they are not the chewy kind that rip your teeth from your gums, they are very soft, u can smush them easily with ur tongue. flavor is great. as the other reviewer stated, there are little pieces of sea salt that crunch and its a wonderful combination of salty and sweet. l would buy them again,  l keep going back for more and the bag is almost empty....."
Tasteless oily and not fresh,"Think twice before ordering, a great dissappointment for candy lovers.<br />This candy was not fresh, could hardly taste blue raspberry, and very rubbery."
favorite food,"This organic beef is by far my cat's favorite can food.  He gobbles it down instantly, which is not true with any other can cat food I give him.  I don't use this everyday (about every 3 or 4 days) because I like to feed a variety of foods to Butch.  I also feed him dehydrated raw food, but at a separate time from the can."
A winner,"I can't find this brand tea at my supermarket and am presently sniffing the empty tea bag because it just takes me back to this wonderful breakfast place somewhere in the Berkshires that made the best banana spice pancakes.<br />I am delighted to find out about this Double Bergamot. The Bergamot is the reason I love this Earl Grey tea above all others.  I am giving this a good review before trying it because that's how much I love the Stash Premium Earl Grey.<br />I would recommend newbies to try the Premium first.  This is a winner among Earl Grey teas.  No one does it better than Stash.<br />I'm tempted to try their Chai Spice Tea.  Celestial Seasonings Vanilla Honey is my favorite.  If Stash makes it better I'm in heaven.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Didn't find a big difference between the Double and Premium Earl Grey.  Still love them.  Tried their Chai Spice--OK, but still love Celest. Seas. better."
Doesn't make anything taste like bacon,"because it isn't bacon.  It tastes like Baco's, which don't taste like bacon.  I fail to understand how anyone who really loves bacon can be satisfied with an imitation."
Very nice breakfast blend,"This is one of my favorite K Cup varieties.  It's important to note that the light classification refers to the roast and flavor of the coffee not the strength of the coffee.  This coffee is no weaker than the darker roasts I've purchased, but the flavor is brighter and great for a morning brew."
Whoa!  My Dog REALLY Likes this Thing!,"When I received this ""Lickety Stik"", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself."
500% markup?,"You have got to be kidding! $5 a bottle? Even in the supermarket these are usually $1.25 each, often under $1. I hope you sell none."
YUM!,"My dogs love the Lickety Stik! I got the bacon flavor, is there anything better than bacon? I use it to distract Joe when his nails are trimmed, he hates having his nails trimmed. Once I figured out that I need to squeeze it gently because the ball doesn't turn it worked fine. I hold it up and Joe licks it like a lamb with a bottle!"
"Chocolate washed out, cookie dry and slightly gritty","I've not had Mallomars before and was looking forward to something similar to a s'more, I guess.  The cookies arrived in good shape; however, the chocolate coating was uneven and had turned slightly grayish white.  The whole thing (chocolate, cookie, and marshmallow) tasted primarily of marshmallow and the dry texture of the cookie gave the treat a slightly gritty feel on the tongue.<br /><br />On the whole, it was an okay sweet treat but not something that I care for.  I tried a couple and will throw the rest away. I don't know if the box I got was indicative of the cookie on a whole, but based on my box, I can't recommend the product."
Suprisingly - I loved it (A happy tea!),"Fruity teas aren't usually my ""thing."" I got this as a free sample with my Teavana order. Delish! Note - the instructions (at least on the sample) were peculiar. They said to use the entire bag. I used about 1.5 tsp for a regular size mug, steeped for 2 minutes and it was great.<br /><br />The tea is lovely. Large chunks of dried fruit. It's fruity, but not too sweet. Would probably make a nice iced tea. So far, I've only had it hot.<br /><br />I described it as a happy tea, because it kinda' makes you feel happy. It's not overly relaxing, nor is it overly energizing. It's just kinda' gives a blissful chill. :)"
Feedback on popcorn items,"Great popcorn, salt and oil. Corn pops great just like good.show house popcorn. Oil taste real buttery and pops good."
Best and easiest Jerk Rub around!,"My first time using this Jerk rub...I sparingly rubbed this onto both sides of 10 uncooked chicken thighs and placed them in the refrigerator, covered with Saran wrap, for 6 hours. I grilled them on my gas grill using indirect heat, for approximately 45 minutes, turning them every 5-10 minutes. When they were done, they were the best tasting chicken thighs we have ever made, or eaten...anywhere! This rub, is a keeper...It perfectly seasons the chicken to perfection...a perfect blend of flavors that meld together into a very flavorful and unique Jerk treat...never had better! Flavorful Jerk spices...A tad bit hot but, I would describe it as a very mild hot...More flavorful than hot...but, I used it sparingly...I used up about 2/3rds of the 10 ounce jar which means I will be buying another 6 jars at a time, just to ALWAYS have it on hand! This stuff is truly the best and I don't want to be without it!"
Raw Revolution Chocolate and Cashew bar,"A decent product and great on the go, but the taste is terrible.  The chocolate raspberry is a little better than the cashew and chocolate bar, but only a little better.  The LARA bar is a much better tasting raw food bar."
Awesome,"Great selection of different coffee options.  It included different blends, flavors, and roasts. Great option if you don't like drinking the same thing everyday!"
Life Saving Bars,"We absolutly love these! They are great tasting, and satifying as a morning or evening snack. We are watching our weight, and will often times have this as our dessert after dinner. We want somthing sweet, but still healthy. Apparently everyone is catching on to how good they are because we can never find them at our local grocery store we shop on a regular basis. We didn't want to look all over, so I went on line in hopes of finding them and did on Amazon.com. Not only did we find them, but they are a little less expensive than buying in the store. I bought a full case and took advantage of the ""super saver shipping"". A case is 60 bars, and for 2 of us not too many. You can always freeze them, and take out a box a day ahead of when you are wanting them. Again, WE LOVE THEM. Hope you enjoy too!<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton"
Yumm-mmee,"OK, I like red licorice.  But Pomegranate?  Well, gee, it's great!  I don't know as there is enough real pomegranite in this licorice, to be called ""healthy"", but it is an organic product, which has got to help.  I particularly like the texture of the product.  At first bite, I thought it was a bit tough, but I soon realized that it was just the right combination of chewy and soft.  And gee, I seem to like pomegranate.  :-)"
Talk about a price hike!!!,"There are the best cookies.  I typically buy them at Sam's at Christmas time.  I pay $10 for the 4 containers.  Goodness grcious, talk about a price hike.  Guess I will wait until Christmas time."
No Issues,"We just received this the other day and we had no issues with any packing or anything.  None of the cans were dented, and since my cats CAN'T talk they were not able to tell me if they liked this or not but since they scarfed the food down I am assuming so.<br /><br />For those people who say their cats didn't like the food, try switching the variety up on them, we order 3 different variety boxes, so that is 24 different flavors of food.  Cats do get bored of the same food over and over just like people."
If you like hot chocolate you will LOVE this!,I have tried hundreds of hot chocolates from the really expensive and really cheap and this is by far the best you can ever have. It is creamy and the wonderful taste of Butterfingers. It is like a candy bar in a mug. However it is not overpowering.<br /><br />If you want to try something delicious this is perfect.
Bisquick Gluten Free,I've tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more yummiest product yet!!  Thank you Betty Crocker!!!
REAL TEA!!! Classic British flavor,"I grew up in Scotland, and I remember drinking 2 or 3 cups of tea a day, even as a child.  When my family and I came to the US and tasted Lipton Tea, we almost died! It didn't taste anything like ""our"" tea.  PG Tips has a smooth and very pleasant flavor, without being weak. So I must say, I am very happy to be able to purchase PG Tips at a very reasonable price from Amazon. My family used to have to have tea sent over from our relatives in the UK before Amazon was around! :)  Whenever friends come over and they try it, they ask what it is, thinking its some ""high end"" expensive loose leaf tea, so they are suprised when they see it comes in a bag.<br /><br />The flavor can be very strong if left to steep for a long time, but as with everything, it depends on each person's preference as to what they like.  I believe this tea is best suited to drink with milk, however it is also pleasant with a little sugar and slice of lemon.  Just remember, when making tea, to use BOILING WATER. I see so many people make tea with hot water, and it just doesn't taste the way it should when made that way.  If you don't believe me, make a cup with each type of water and test it yourself, I think you'll be very surprised.<br /><br />I highly recommend PG Tips, and have not found it less expensive than Amazon's price anywhere else."
Good treat for my Maltese,"These are good, however, my dog likes the duck better . . . it could just be individual preference.  They are so much more reasonable through Amazon that what I can obtain locally."
This is an outstanding deal,"My husband is from England, and this is his favorite tea--he grew up drinking it. I've ordered it through the subscribe and save option, and can't believe the incredible deal I'm getting! This tea is over $7.00 a package for the same 40 count box at the grocers! Needless to say, I'm thrilled. I drink it as well, I like it-it's smooth, and not too acidic, with a great full flavor. Beats the American competitor hands down, and is cheaper as well! If you want to know what tea tastes like for many English people, give this a shot, it's the real deal on all accounts!"
OK but much prefer the Mexican Harvest variety,"First sampling yielded a ""not-quite yuck"" factor but definitely not a ""hooray"" either. I've gotten used to them and will finish the order, but future orders will be Mexican Harvest. In general, I love the crunch and healthy ingredient list as I avoid traditional crackers."
My 2 cats LOVE LOVE LOVE Earthborn wet food,"This is a great product made with whole bits of tuna and mackerel.  My 2 cats won't eat pate type food and it is difficult to find chunky wet food that is also grain free.  This food (all flavors) meets all the requirements . . . my cats love it and I know that I am feeding them healthy food.  This company has never been involved in a recall, only puts in quality ingredients and has a 100% money back guarantee."
Great Instant Sugar Free Cider,"I am surprised by the negative reviews here.  I mean, instant cider (the kind you get in the packets) will never taste like real cider.  This is actually better than the brands of instant cider I have found.  Yes, it is sweet, and the caramel ""finish"" is a nice addition.  This is the only K-Cup product I have found that is sugar free, which I appreciate.  If you enjoy instant cider, I wouldn't hesitate."
goodbye coffee!,"Well, I love coffee too much to let it go all the way but one shot of this and I'm powered up and ready to go! Tastes great and full of beneficial vitamins and nutrients."
I have been eating these cookies for years,"I love this new 16 pack!  The value is great, much, much cheaper than buying from the actual company.  I definitely will be buying more and hope I can get just the chocolate this way next time."
Rubber gum.,"Good flavor but it's like chewing on rubber after about 20 minutes or so.Have the headache meds close by , you'll need them chomping on this gum."
LOVE IT,I use this product for a specific recipe i make for every party. Problem is that I can't find it in my local grocery store any more - Amazon pulled through and I now purchase it by the case from Amazon!!!
Vitamin-ize,Vitamin squeeze energy drink fruit punch is a good little flavor enhancer with some vitamins you can squirt into your water. Two squeezes and your water is flavored with a light fruity flavor. The container is a fairly convenient small plastic bottle with a stopper that's easy to squeeze through. It contains enough fluid so that you can flavor and vitamin-ize several drinks.  I would certainly try the product again.
Perfect for protecting your garden!,"I own 6 of these and they perform flawlessly. Plenty of shocking power and perfect for protecting your precious garden from marauding critters looking for a meal. There are a lot of cheaper fence chargers/energizers on the market; don't waste your money on ones that short out when one blade of grass lands on it! You pay for what you get.<br /><br />If you need one with plenty of punch that delivers a good jolt, the SS-1000X does just that. My pet goat and sheep respect my electric fences when I have one of these operating them, too.<br /><br />Key features: low impedance, solid-state, imtermittent current and a joule rating of 1 or higher."
Arrived slightly damaged but still works,"I received this product promptly but when it arrived the cap had been slightly damaged.  It looked like something very heavy had been put on top of it and crushed it a bit.  One edge of the cap was bent.  However, it only took a little work with some pliers to straighten it out and it screwed onto the jar easily.<br /><br />Apart from that small damage it works as advertised and is a good deal at the price paid."
"Good texture, flavor - but expensive to try","I tried these because I saw them mentioned in Reader's Digest. For those that love those cheap ramen (Nissan, Maruchan, etc.) these will likely give you what you are looking for as a healthier option. They have a similar texture to cheap ramen, but not the unhealthy fats. They also have 6g of fiber per serving. Low-carb dieters beware: they are high in carbs, even considering the fiber.<br /><br />They have a bit of a 'vegetably' taste and odor to them, but I don't mind. I usually take the seasoning packet out of the Maruchan ramen and use that with these. They sell these noodles with soup base on other listings, but I suggest trying them plain and/or using your preferred seasoning before buying those.<br /><br />They're expensive to try out at first, but once you become addicted it's easier to get them cheaper by buying the plain noodles in bulk, directly. Give them a shot!"
Great Coffee,"This is the best coffee I have found so far. A lovely blend, dark and rich (which we love), and smells delightful. The taste is full and flavorful not at all bitter. I will be purchasing again."
Great,The product is great.  I prefer this over all your other products.  Very tasty.  Not much more to say.  I would buy it again.
Perhaps My Favorite Food In The World!!,"I made a decision years ago to eat healthier, and one of the things that I gave up was peanut butter cups.  However, I was overjoyed when I found PB2 with Premium Chocolate in my local grocery store (I'm also a big fan of the original PB2, btw).  It is in essence peanut butter with 85% less fat.<br /><br />The premise is that they roast the peanuts and then press out the majority of the oil before making the peanut powder.  When you go to use PB2, you add water for moisture to create a much lower fat version of peanut butter.  I find that I need to add a little more water than what the instructions call for in order to make it spreadable.<br /><br />While regular PB2 is good for anything you would use peanut butter for, PB2 with Premium Chocolate is great for sweet treats.  My favorite thing to do is to mix some up and have it with frozen yogurt - either plain vanilla or dark chocolate.  With dark chocolate frozen yogurt, I get something that is very close in flavor to Dryer's Chocolate Ice Cream with Peanut Butter Cups; however it has less than half the calories and only 13 calories from fat!  You can't beat it.<br /><br />The tradeoff you make is having to mix it up.  For me it is worth the effort.  I love this stuff.  In addition to frozen yogurt, it is also good as a topping for energy bars from KIND.  Get creative.  It is low cal, low fat, and it is also filling.  What you mix up is very dense with the majority of the fat removed.  I can't recommend this enough to anyone he is looking for a healthy alternative to satisfy their peanut butter and chocolate cravings."
The BEST Italian seasoning ever!,I love Emeril's Italian Essence!  It makes store-bought sauce taste positively homemade.  I get compliments on my sauce like I stood over the stove for hours making it.  I highly recommend this seasoning to anyone who likes Italian food...and doesn't have the time to make it from scratch.  Enjoy!
Favorite,"My boys all time fave. Excellent protein sources, and all around ingredients. No grain is huge."
"Great tasting Ice.,,,",Makes great tasting Ice.<br />Mix one Luanne Qt tea with 2 Ber tea bags. Makes one quart.<br />Sweeten to taste. Delish!
"Delicious, healthy snack","I found PopCorners in my local corner store and wanted to see if it was available for sale online and was thrilled to see that it not only was, but was available in bulk.  As someone who has to watch certain food ingredients (no gluten for celiac disease), this product not only matches my requirements but also tastes very good.  Highly recommended for for other celiac suffers and others looking for a more healthy snack alternative."
I wanted to love these...,"I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere."
Snacking without effort,"The warehouse deals are where I usually buy my snacking needs... Wheat Thins just happen to be my downfall. And 6 boxes for just a little less than I would spend at the grocery store, with free delivery is the best thing my nibbling mouth could ever hope for.  They last me a while, I don't feel too guilty, and my wallet doesn't know the difference. When I receive my order, they've always been within a fair amount of time before they expire as well which I was worried about the first time I ordered."
Kind Bars are the Best!,"This box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio & Antioxidants is delicious as is all the Kind Bar products.  They are a great choice for a balanced, satisfying, nutritious bar very low in sodium and without gluten.  LOVE KIND bars.  I will definitely be back for more.  The 12 Pack boxes from Amazon are a GREAT VALUE too!"
Great value,"These k-cups are a great value - much better cost per unit than other places (grocery store, etc).<br />I love the flavor of the Caribou  coffee k-cups...they are my favorite. This one is great, and the obsidian as well."
great tea!!!,I'm definitely a subscriber to this tea!  The longer you brew it the better.  I actually just keep it in a thermos.  yum!
A Good Chew,"Our shih tzu Piper had dental surgery to remove four broken teeth. Her dental surgeon vet blamed hard chew treats for the broken teeth. In hindsight some of the chews were so hard that I had to use a saw to cut them in half for sharing between the two dogs. The vet advised us to use the bend test. If the chew isn't flexible, don't give it to your dog.<br /><br />The Nylabone Healthy Edible passes the bend test. Looking at the bone-shaped treat, one would think it is a hard object and a long lasting chew. Piper and Gabby both like these chews. Depending on the dog, these treats can be long lasting without jeapardizing the teeth of the dog.<br /><br />Being a spudophile, I'm pleased that ingredient number four is potato starch. Despite the Nylabone name, these chews contain no plastic. Also lacking are sugar, salt, preservatives, and gluten. The ingredients are natural and it is edible and highly digestible as advertised. Our pooches give the American made Healthy Edibles their barks of approval."
Missing,When I received my case of tea instead of 24 teas there were only 23. This was the first occurence.
Not Bad,"I love teas with mint, so I decided to give this one a try. Its really good and refreshing but the mint flavor isn't as strong as I would like to be. Not saying that it should be overbearing, but I had to question whether or not mint was even in the tea. All in all, its a good tea."
damage product,I got my nestle nestum cerelac and my product was open one of the can was open. I would like to no if there is an reimburse.
Great cracker snack,"I used to buy this product at Costco but they quit carrying it.  I liked it so much I started a search and then thought ""Amazon"".  Sure enough there they were, only 5 were left; I bought 3.  I hope Amazon restocks because I will have to find them somewhere. They are so good and have become one of my favorite snacks just by themselves--nothing on them.  Try them; you'll like them!"
Nice bold coffee!,"Before we got the Kuerig brewer, my husband bought starbucks coffee which is pretty strong. This coffee is his favorite and he tried quite a few k cups. If you like bold coffee, you will like this one. Enjoy!"
yummy but this price is way too much,"24 bags for $22? thats very expensive. sure they taste really good especially the strawberry/banana and the fuji apples but they have this variety pack at Costco for $12.99 with 10 fuji apples, 5 strawberry/banana, 5 asian pears = 20 bags."
Only Treat my Cat LOVES,"Milhouse will be 14 this year, and I have purchased treats once in a while, and he liked them but never loved them, so many treats fell by the wayside.  I pick these up at a store, thinking why not try them and he LOVED them.  He does not get them every day, but I will leave a few out once or twice a week, and he gets really excited to ""find"" his treat and crunch down on them.  So, I picked up the 5 pack from Amazon, and I have a very happy cat. He still likes them and looks forward to the discovery."
Excellent.,"I was looking for an organic vanilla wafer, both for munching and for making banana/cookie pudding. Although slightly smaller around and slightly thicker than the popular national brand, these are great for both purposes. Flavor is good and vanilla-y and the texture and moisture content are excellent."
Just plain ol' not good,"Bought these from another vendor, as I was craving licorice. I love licorice, all kinds, and I couldn't even eat more than a taste of this. I threw it away it was so unpleasant."
Nice treat.  Cleaning teeth?  Not so much.,"I appreciate the ingredient list in these Checkups, with no wheat, gluten, or corn, no added sugar.  We have 2 shetland sheepdogs, and one of my shelties has epilepsy and it seems gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers so we avoid those ingredients.<br /><br />Zoey (28 lbs) & Bailey (21 lbs) would each get one Checkup once or twice a week, and didn't have any problems with throwing these up or getting runny poo.  But they would eat them by breaking off a piece with their molars (which was easy for them to do), then work the piece around in their mouth to soften and chew it, and swallow.  Gone in less than 10 minutes, even for Zoey who is a ""lady-like"" eater and thoroughly chews everything, never gulping.  The problem spot on my shelties' teeth is their canine teeth, they get plaque buildup near the gumline.  These Checkups don't do a thing for front teeth because my dogs only use their molars to (briefly) chew them.<br /><br />My vet recommended instead to get raw (not cooked!) beef knuckle bones or marrow bones, because the shape and size of those encourage the dog to use their front teeth to get in there and pull and pluck at the meat and marrow, in addition to using their molars to scrape off meat.  The raw bones don't splinter and are soft enough that they won't crack my dogs' teeth.  (FYI: After trying both knuckle and marrow bones, my shelties get more chewing with knuckle bones and they each get to chew on the knuckle bone for an hour every other day on a mat in the garage... chewing makes them happy and tired, and my vet is very happy with their teeth.)  My vet said for teeth cleaning we need scraping action, and these Checkups don't provide it, nor do any of those ""dental rawhides"" you see in stores.<br /><br />These Checkups are a nice little quick treat for my small/medium size shelties, but not for teeth cleaning.  5 stars for the good ingredient list, but 1-star for teeth cleaning action... average of 3 stars.  Perhaps if you have a tiny little dog and the idea of raw knuckle bones grosses you out, these Checkups might be a good option, but I won't buy these again as they're just not what I need.<br /><br />Checkups Ingredients (from the Checkups website):<br />Potato flour, rice flour, glycerine, water, natural flavor, gelatin, canola oil, titanium dioxide, monoglycerides of edible fatty acids, flaxseed oil, citric acid, magnesium stearate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate"
Not as flavorful as I had imagined!,I guess I had too high a hope for this little cake.  I found it to be quite dry and lacking in nuts.  The cinnamon flavor was really rich and delicious though.  I will not ever buy it again but you should give it a try since it is so cheap and you can get it as 'one' instead of the usual multiples that Amaazon sells.  It was a unique flavor for a one time trial so I am glad I bought it but I don't need to repeat that mistake again.  Maybe the one I got was old though the expiration date was fine.  I love cinnamon so that made it worth actually eating along with a whole cup of tea to wash it down.  I say....give it a try like I did.
salt &pepper popchips are the best,"Anyone that likes Salt and Peppercorn Kettle Chips will like this snack.<br /><br />Salt and Pepper Popchips are one of the best munchie snacks that has come out in a long time.  No saturated fat, and no trans fat...Great taste with no guilt.<br /><br />Granted they are not quite as addicting as the Kettle Chips,  but they have a lot less fat.<br /><br />i am concerned that safeway and nobb hill grocery stores are not carrying this product anymore.  i am thinking about ordering a dozen cases and stockpile them up so that i am INSURED of my supply."
a wrong product,"I am writing to let you know that you send a wrong kind of product.<br />I ordered Japanese Green Tea Mochi + Yomogi & Read Been Mochi, so they are 2 packs. As you posted picture, one kind should be different but what you sent is the same 2packs of Green tea mochi. It is different from the picture of these products you posted on amazon.com.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009OD4EQ"">Japanese Green Tea Mochi + Yomogi & Red Bean Mochi Sampler - 2x 8 Pc</a><br />I bought these for my friend's birthday gift whose birthday is this Friday.<br />How will you do with this problem?"
Culinary secret,Someone recently gave me a small grinder containing pink Himalayan rock salt crystals.  The difference in the taste it added to food prompted me to do some reading on the differences.  You can do your own reading and I'll just say that it opens up a whole new world of flavors.  When that small grinder neared being empty I set about to find some refill material.  The price of the product from this supplier made me suspicious of it's quality.  Happily though........it's as good as any I've found.  The packaging and shipping were both professional and I am quite pleased with the order and intend to be a repeat customer.
Good food,"My 7 month old son likes this. We tried this after first doing peaches and bananas separately, and he likes them together too."
"They do work, but this isn't a good deal","I bought ""Greenies"" after hearing rave reviews about them from friends. I buy all my pet supplies on Amazon.com and was able to purchase the value pack 36oz container when on a lightening deal ($22). My dog loves them, but she eats anything - I do think they help with tartar and her breath. My reason for 3 stars is because I don't feel like it is that good of a deal. There are not that many chews in the box and I thought I was getting a steal on them when I did. No one in their right mind would pay $130 for this container, I think even $35 is a ripoff."
Bag too big - gets stale!,"Maybe they dont put enough of the ""white"" products savers in the bag.  The jerky was stale and hard in both bags.  Go with the smaller bags for basically the same cost when you add up the total ounces.  Wont be getting the bigger back again from Amazon!"
Oops! My mistake: CONTAINS BPA! Goodbye to this product!,"UPDATE: BUT 5 stars GO TO AMAZON WHO ISSUED A CREDIT FOR MY LAST ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT! GOOD WORK AND THANK YOU AMAZON, I AM IMPRESSED!!! -Mo<br />..........................................<br /><br />(change from 5 stars to 1) CANCEL THIS PRAISE OF THIS PRODUCT! It DOES contain BPA! -Mo<br />..........................................<br /><br />This is *great* fish; no BPA, no added salt (*I* choose what and if salt is added), I LOVE lots of eatable fish bones (top calcium availability), congratulations Crown Prince and thank you for canning fish I can eat without BPA!"
"Fragrant, Tender Rice","This is just about my favorite brand of rice.  I cook it up quickly in the microwave (2 cups rice, 3 1/2 cups water, tiny bit of butter, microwave programmed to cook 10 minutes at 90% power, 15 minutes at 40%) and then top it with Chinese meat/sauce combinations or use it in Spanish Rice, Rice Pudding, Fried Rice, etc.  Faster than a speeding bullet!  Economical, too.  Wish I had always known how to do this."
You have to be kidding me...,"Why the hell would you pay this much when a grocery store is within a few miles from home, costing much less. Someone please explain."
"Cat loves it, but it STINKS horribly","I've been feeding my cat this food for about 2 weeks and my cat loves it. However, I feed my cat in the dining room and I eat my breakfast in the living room because the food stinks and the smell lingers.<br /><br />My cat seems very healthy and always has lots of energy after his meal. He seems very healthy and excited to be fed and licks the can clean.<br /><br />But I think I'll return to Tiki Cat or Newman's Own. I change his litterbox at least twice per day because I will not have my house smelling like animal droppings. I will not tolerate foul cat food smell either."
"too rich for my dog, gave her black poo",I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.  I just didnt feel comfortable with the color of her stool.  It returned to normal as soon as I stopped giving it to her.  I think the liver content is too high for an every day food.  It might be ok to give 1-2 times a month but thats it.  I even mixed the food with fresh veggies.  It didnt work for us.
Exactly what I wanted and could not buy at Walmart,"I had purchased this product at Walmart in the past. When I tried to buy more, no one had any idea what I was talking about but were sure ""They quit makin' it"". Thanks WallyWorld."
"Too much candy coating, not enough almond","Sure they look nice, but the coating is so think you just suck and suck and wonder why, since they should be mainly almonds, after all.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PI6LOQ"">Grecian Imports Brand - Jordan Almonds - Super Fine (Best Grade) - Assorted Colors - Polished (shiny) 1 pound</a>"
Great taste/flavor  you would never know low calorie w/2g fiber,I found Kavli at big lots for around the same price.  I travel a lot and it made it easy to pack away in a suitcase or purse.
Candy,I do not personally eat this candy.  It is used to give to co-workers who smile during the day.  They seem to like it.
Meh,"I bought this for my cat, who suddenly started vomiting on a daily basis. No rhyme or reason for it either, not hairballs, or some kind of illness. This didn't help the vomiting issue and considering the cost of the food and composition, I've since switched her to a product richer in proteins that costs a similar amount and actually seems to have quickly cleared up the problem."
Convience,Thank you-this is so convenient to have this  to subscribe to anything that I need constantly -Amazon has started to help me  to stay on my diet! Thanks
What more do you want?,"The taste isn't great, but you can get used to it (I mix mine in water).  I am a vegan and I don't like eating a lot of soy (I think it may upset my stomach).  This product has 0 grams of sugar and only 4 grams of carbohydrates and is very low in fat, so you cannot expect it to taste DELICIOUS. There is 22 grams of protein per serving from non-soy vegetable sources, so 3 shakes a day for a work out routine plus snacks in between is a routine worth trying."
Restaurant Style and Quality,"First of all the shipping on this product was super fast and took me by surprise.  Second the quality of this product is outstanding.  Finally in Iowa I can drink some restaurant qualiy and tasting Thai tea.  Although the package does not indicate this, sweetened condensed milk is also amazing as a sweetener.  That is how my favorite Thai restaurant in Chicago prepares it.  So basically if you're looking for quality, a great price and authentic Thai taste, this product is what you're looking for!"
Raw Oats good product,"This is the best hot cereal Ive had, its all they say it is. The only complaint is that it is quite expensive for what you get. As long as that doesnt bother you I would highly recommend it."
Flowers never opened and wilted in a day,I sent these flowers to my Mother for her birthday. They wilted in a day or two and the buds never opened.
Very versatile stuff!,"My new perfect-world 'wish list item' is a 'collection' that has one of each of the bag-style mixes that Pamela makes. I mean geez buying a whole collection of any given thing just to try it out is pretty expensive! But this bake mix rocks.<br /><br />I didn't use to think I had any dietary issues. When I was 35 I suddenly developed 'severe asthma' but had never had it before. But when I accidentally dropped gluten from my diet (eating mostly meats/eggs/veggies for 3 weeks) I discovered that my ""severe asthma,"" and a decent chunk of my allergies, acne, acid reflux, brain fog, etc. were apparently due to gluten. Ironically grain-based foods have been the primary foods my entire life, sigh.<br /><br />Giving up everything remotely bread-like really sucked. I did it for the sake of keeping my sugar intake low (carbs are either fiber or sugar--so a bagel tends to have more sugar to the body than a candy bar) but once in awhile I would just leap off the wagon and eat something baked. The problem was, it wasn't just that I'd be increasing my sugar/carb intake, which I can live with now and then, but I'd be getting gluten too, and would discover by nightfall when it became inconvenient to breathe that my 'severe asthma' was back. (Why more people with asthmatic kids don't at least *try* serious food eliminations is beyond me...) My boyfriend's docs after much testing tried to diagnose him with Crohns and IBS, insisting he is not celiac [like his sister] and should just keep eating those healthy (...) whole grains. But it turns out when he avoids gluten for awhile, he isn't sick and in pain, he's just fine, as an amazing coincidence. So in the process of experimenting, we've discovered Pamela's brand. It is a dream come true.<br /><br />Pancakes. Waffles. Cookies. Cakes. Breaded fried chicken. We don't use it very often (as we're mostly lowcarb) but when we do, my 13 year old gives it two thumbs up... There is nothing we've tried to make with this, pretty much using it like flour for the most part, that has not come out good. I am hugely grateful for Pamela's brand making gluten-free eating just as tasty as mainstream food. Since I unfortunately am only 'inconvenienced' by gluten (as opposed to genuine *pain*) I'm the type that would occasionally eat it anyway just because I so missed a lifetime food that was based on grains. Thanks to Pamela's, now I can have those foods once in awhile without damaging my body in the process. Yay!  I can't wait to try some of the other options!"
Perfect drink while pregnant,"This is a wonderful beverage to enjoy daily while pregnant!  I am 6 months preg and started feeling dizzy/lightheaded.  OB said to drink more liquids but I still have morning sickness and liquids before 10 AM dont stay down.  I tried several different coconut waters and found this Zico chocolate, ONE with guava and Naked plain to be the three I prefer.  This Zico chocolate is my favorite!  It is good in the morning when milk is too heavy and fruit juice is unappealing.  I feel much better after a couple of weeks drinking 1-2 coconut waters a day in addition to as much regular water I can stomach.  It is an expensive habit, but prescription anti nausea pills or going to the ER from dehydration is more expensive."
I love it.,"I love all Tazo products, and this one is without fail all it says it is.  If you are a fan of Tazo I would recommend buying it.  If you have never tried Tazo products I would recommend buying a variety pack so you can try many different flavors and decide for yourself if it is for you.  I personally love it."
a ripoff,in the add for lipton decaf tea bags 48pk the customer is led to believe that they are buying 48 boxes of tea instead when we received the order there were only twelve boxes of 48.  We will not be buying another product from this company again.  We can buy the same thing from the grocery store for half of what we paid buying it online.
go to aromatic,This is a huge bag of bay leaves. Bay is one of my go-to aromatics and use them almost daily. I'm pleased with the quality of this product and would buy them again without hesitation.
A must-have staple in my kitchen,"Glace de Viande Gold in a classic brown stock reduction. It can be reconstituted into a full flavored stock by using 1 part glace to 20 parts water. The stock is great for moistening stuffing, making soups or making a jus for dipping. The flavor is much more complex and professional tasting than other prepared stocks and broths found in most grocery stores.<br /><br />A glace is traditionally made by reducing stock veal stock for 8-12 hours until it has the consistency of a thick syrup. To bring this product to the consistency of a classic glace add 1 part de Viande Gold to 3 parts water. I use the glace for adding flavor to sauces when I don't want any extra thickening agent. If I want the flavor of a glace but also want it to help hold a sauce together I use More than Gourmet's Demi-Glace Gold which is pretty much the same thing but it contains a roux.<br /><br />These products last for months in the frig so I purchase these in the 16 oz. tubs. For some of the glaces and stock reductions that I use less frequently I purchase the 1.5 oz. pucks. They are made using classic recipes and are the real deal. I keep 8-10 different varieties on hand in my kitchen and would not want to think about cooking without them."
A pleasing cup of coffee,"I found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my ""go-to"" coffees for my Keurig.  Not too strong or bitter, I rather enjoy the flavor.  Sadly with the recent ""K-cup coup"" staged by Green Mountain Coffees, it looks like Amazon isn't carrying the Wolfgang Puck coffees any longer and my Subscribe and Save (and my business) will need to go elsewhere.  Definitely give this coffee a shot if you can."
A very pleasant surprise,I saw this product at a local store and tried it.  I couldn't believe how good it is.  It practically tastes like cow's milk to me and I thought it was superior to unsweetened almond milk.  I enjoy it in coffee as well as straight up.  I am glad to find it available on Amazon.
Nice Earl Grey,We were looking to replace the Twinnings Earl Grey that we bought in the store in the tin and found this one on Amazon's site.  This is a very nice Earl Grey.  It is very fragrant and is not bitter at all.  The leaves are whole or close to it.  It is a little lighter than Twinnings (although that may due to the quantity of leaves used).  A terrific black tea!
Best Protein Drink Out There!,"As a weight loss & fitness blogger and runner, I've tried so many protein drinks. CLICK is by far the most delicious - yes! it's delicious - product out there. The mocha is my favorite, and for only 120 calories per serving, I know it's not going to blow my diet. It's great pre- or post- workout, as a meal replacement (made with milk), a snack, hot, cold, blended. You name it. I always feel great when I drink CLICK, energized, never shaky."
"Fine, but not great for PEZ dispensers","This is a great price.  But, don't order for PEZ dispensers because many of the packages that we have opened have cracked or dessimated pieces of candy."
Taste better than they smell,"The assortment and taste is very good, but they were order and delivered in the Summer and they smell like they were in a fire.  It doesn't affect the taste, but the smoke smell is very noticeable.  Maybe they shouldn't be sent in hot weather or should be packed differently."
Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic,"My husband enjoys this coffee so much, we're constantly running out; we needed a large amount.  I searched the WWW for the best buy and came up with Amazon.com as a best buy.  Thank you for your great service."
Best sugar substitute EVER!,I've tried just about every sugar sub out there and my favorite so far had been Somersweet but this is far better. It works perfectly for baking and keeps the textures of items exactly as sugar would. There is NO aftertaste at all. We love this product and have put it on auto order every month. With auto order you save 15% and the shipping is free!
"Good taste, poor quality pods","I really enjoy the flavor of this coffee! The taste is subtle and not too strong.  The only problem is that in almost every package there is at least one pod that is ripped or broken and all the coffee is in the bottom of the bag...very messy and of course, the pod is unusable.<br />A little quality control would go a long way!"
Best. Mustard. Ever.,"Great with bratwurst, breakfast sausages, salami, cheddar cheese, sandwiches, etc., even though it is a bit exotic/expensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background, it's best to keep it simple and let it stand out."
Handy Stevia for traveling,"This Stevia product is made by Stevita and is just a straight liquid sweetener. It doesn't come in all the flavors the way SweetLeaf Stevia does. However, the plastic bottle and smaller size makes it very convenient to travel with and have a spot or two of stevia in my coffee beverages at a restaurant. I noticed some say ""yuck"" and it isn't as sweet as perhaps SweetLeaf or the artificial sweeteners - but I'm so thankful it's even available. It is a whole lot less YUCKY for my needs, being based on natural herbal plant, and not on chemically processed ""sugars"" like aspartame or Splenda (R)(TM) or other artificial sweeteners. It just depends on your needs and if you are really serious about using a more natural product then you'll eventually get used to the taste of this (just as some take a while to get used to taste of artificial sweeteners!)."
Made in China,Bought at Costco but just recently came across an article about Waggin Train products where dogs have died or become seriously ill. Grateful that I had other treats and my dogs did not get alot of these...bag going in the garbage ASAP as I'd rather lose my money than my dogs.<br /><br />I won't buy any dog products made in china anymore considering their lack of environmental rules/laws and care and their attitudes towards dogs in general (they don't value dogs so why would they take care that the treats are not toxic?)<br /><br />Would not recommend.
Juice,Excellent flavor for the Vodka martinis I drink.  Shipping container was sturdy and all bottles well protected.  Individual bottles made great stocking stuffers for my martini friends and relatives.
Great Stuff!,"LOVE this Oatmeal! Takes longer to make than the quick instant stuff, but well worth it! Very filling :-)"
Perfect holiday gift,Bought these for my 75 yr old father who has everything!  He truly enjoyed them and said they were delivered very quickly.
Didn't last long,"Have a 6-month old black labrador.  She destroyed toy in less than a week.  When the container broke, it was very sharp."
best service,"product was sent out right away, and was as advertised. great place to buy, but it takes some research to learn how to use this product. Very healthy stuff!"
This Apple Cider is Awesome,I have to say I was afraid to try it because of the experience I had with the Grove Square coffee.  But WOW what a difference in product.  This is much better than the Green Mountain Cider and it is sugar free.  The price is right also!
"Great Quality, Low on Quantity","I bought these after having a minor freak out about Chinese made products, especially those made of meat - it's hard to trust, and I just won't do it.<br /><br />That said, my dog loves these and I have no problem with the product's quality. Very good - though the pieces are a bit small and would be nicer if he had a bigger piece to chew and work on for a while.<br /><br />I admittedly didn't look at the ounces on the product description. You don't get much for what you pay. That's the only thing that brings this thing down from 5 stars - the value just doesn't seem to be there for me.  I'll keep looking, might even just make my own."
great brew,"i've been using these k-cups for months now.  the breakfast blend is perfect for people who don't like a very strong bitter coffee in the morning.  the coffee from the breakfast blend is wonderful... not too strong, not overwhelming, but delicious."
Are You Serious,"Pretty costly gal. of BBQ sauce, is it made of gold? I would be interested at the normal price,this has to be a typo...."
Premium quality,I'm a foodie and have compared many olive oils.  This is the best tasting and rich olive oil for a very reasonable price.
Great for Kids,"This company has great items, especially for children on a gluten-free or gluten-free + dairy-free diet. I have one special diet child and one who doesn't have to be on one, and both adore these cookies. They are great to take to school too. I suggest trying all of Cherrybrook's gluten-free items, especially if you have a mixed household -- no one will feel slighted with these!"
Great price on hard-to-find tea!,"My 18-year-old son loves hot tea and Lady Grey is one of his favorites. Our local source stopped carrying it, and we searched the stores in surrounding towns but could not find it. Then I hit on the bright idea of trying Amazon! No problem finding it, at a much better price than grocery stores. The turnaround was fast as well -- we received it in 2-3 days, just in time for my son to take it back to college with him! He tells me it is delicious and we are both very pleased."
"Marley Coffee, One Love Organic","I made my coffee the usual way but it was not strong enough. I don't like my coffee overly strong, but I do like it to taste like coffee. I made another cup, but used 2 packets, perfect! It tastes exactly like coffee, nothing over the top, just coffee. I gave it 4 stars though because it is organic, and I prefer everything organic!"
Muchas gracias A++++++,"the flavor of this salt is wonderful, it is light and unique. I love it. plus it has all the minerals we are missing from our refined salt that we buy at the grocers.A++++++"
"Great Taste and Value!!  Great gift idea for seniors, students or singles","Just got this and opened it tonight, and this merits my first review! Tastes homemade, lots of beef and potatoes, the gravy is wonderful and plentiful if you want to add vegetables or dip biscuits.  It was just what I wanted on a cold rainy winter night.  Got the 38oz so I could use it as dinners, and a half can is ample dinner for someone hungry.  (Beats the heck out of takeout, chinese, pizza or burgers for both price and taste: ca. $2/half can.)  In this recession, a practical gift like this will definitely be appreciated, so If you're looking to send a little something to someone living alone (elderly, students, singles, physically challenged) who work all the time or don't like to cook, this is it! I'm 50+ and have a back injury that makes standing/cooking difficult and painful especially in this weather; but this microwaves in minutes and hits the spot.  I didn't even have to haul it in from the car; delivered free to the doorstep by UPS! I was hesitant this time ordering canned food with the holiday this week, but I got it in 2 days!  You got a customer for life, the price was excellent and delivery faster than I expected!"
So so,"My 18 month old likes them, but he will eat pretty much antying. My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon."
My puppy LOVES these,These are awesome. My puppy loves them and I love that they made his breath smell better. They are soft and much safer than giving your dog a Greenie in my opinion (not to mention that they are safe for puppies whereas Greenies are not recommended for dogs under 6 months). This makes these the ideal teething chew-able treat.
There are two! from concentrate and not from concentrate,"I haven't had a lot of experience with zico, but I have seen lot of reviews saying that they switched to concentrate. With little research, I found that the one in the 11.2 ounce carton thing is not from concentrate. Sure, I can agree based on sheer numbers that this coconut water sucks, but the other one does exist in case some of you still care."
Definitely not a tortilla substitute,"Does it matter if things are healthy if they don't taste very good?  This multi-grain chips may be packed with goodness, but they taste like a stale wheat thin that was left sitting in a bag of real tortilla chips for awhile and managed to pick up a bit of their flavor.  I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.  But anyone looking to chow down on some tortilla chips isn't going to be too happy, and would have to force themselves through a bag of these rather than eating what they really wanted.<br /><br />Unless you covered them with cheese and made nachos.  Because that makes everything taste better!"
best wheat pancake - even at 3700 ft!,"We have a great restaurant in town that serves these fabulous granola pancakes; after trying this Krusteaz Wheat and Honey pancake mix I think I have cracked their secret. These cook up tender and fluffy, not too thin or thick when following the directions. They have a hearty balanced wheat taste that is lightly sweet. I would recommend throwing in a small handful of granola once the mix is on the pan; makes a wonderful addition to the pancake, especially when served with real maple syrup.<br /><br />I use this mix at a high altitude and it's the only one so far that comes out right. I've had to discontinue using two old favorites baking mixes (Bisquick and Carbon) because they required too much tweaking to get a good pancake. The Krusteaz mix works well and tastes great. Bonus is that it is usually the cheapest mix on the shelf as well.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended."
K-cup Celestial Seasonings green tea,"The Celestial Seasonings authentic green tea k-cup is very good.  One K-cup makes adequate flavor of 9.25 oz. of hot tea.  Most of the k-cup assorted coffee produces light, watery coffee at 7.25 oz., but this green tea has  good color and taste even at the max. 9.25 oz.  I would recommend this green tea k-cup."
Very good!!  Pricey though,I don't understand why this is so pricey - compared to the other Sunbutters - I like the fact that it is NO STIR.<br /><br />Would be great if you did this with the crunch Sunbutter.<br /><br />Great product!
How Could You Be So Bold,"After FINALLY purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!"
Convenience of Auto Delivery,"I find it very convenient to have some of my grocery products automatically delivered to my door.  However, when I did postpone an order because I didn't need it yet, it was a problem getting it delivered sooner when I did run out."
"Great popcorn,even better customer service!","Great Northern Popcorn is the best.  We have used this popcorn both on the stove top and in our popcorn machine, it can't be beat!  Even better is the customer service at Discount Tommy!  They stand behind absolutely everything they sell!"
Senna Leaf,I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita. Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I'm happy for it...
Amaizing Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds,"These are one of the best snacks on the planet. The only thing that even comes close is Slim Jims. I used to get two small foil packs of these out of a vending machine, and a can of Pepsi for lunch every day when I was going through post grad school, and they never got old.<br />The smoke flavor isn't too strong nor so subtle that you can't detect it. They have a perfect amount of crunch, and just the right amount of salt as well. Wash them down with a Pepsi, (or Coke if you prefer) and it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />Why someone gave these a one star review due to the price is beyond me. You rate the  product here, not the price. But people also sue McDonald's for their coffee being hot, so what do you expect?<br /><br />If you've never had these give them a shot. You won't regret it."
Vegetarian Staple,"This product is a must have because it is a way for vegetarians to be able to have protein while on the go, and also for anyone whose physician has recommended additional protein intake, especially throughout the day.  The convenience is great and the flavor of this product is super.  I really enjoy it."
The perfect compromise: Drinkable instant coffee,"Better than all other instants, as good as many brewed coffees, Starbucks VIA is a great balance between fast, easy and good.  Heat your water, tap the powder out of the tube into a cup, pour and stir.  No grinding, no filters, no mudding the beans; it's just as fast, and just as easy, and spooning crystals out of a jar.  But Starbucks VIA is far, far superior to any other kind of instant, and gives a lot of second rate brews a run for their money.  Is it as good as my best beans, freshly ground and brewed?  No.  But it's better than the coffee that comes out of Keurig packs, and better than the coffee from fast-food restaurants.  And it's instant.  Sometimes you'll want to take the time and trouble for the best possible cup of coffee; and sometimes you'll just want a dang cup of something hot, strong and black.  For those times VIA is a great choice."
My favorite!,This makes for a great cup of coffee!  It's the perferct brew strength for me and a nice flavor that has a little bite to it.
Why the fillers and guar gum? Sigh,"Unfortunately, I can't afford a raw food diet for my cats and they want nothing to do with Felidae, the only affordable truly healthy food that has an ingredients list that makes me feel comfortable. My cats love both turkey formulas of Newman's brand. I always have dry food available which they like but they become vocal to be feed this stuff, they are Siamese so I must do their bidding or the racket doesn't end. I always smell the open product and for six months now, no irregular smells or coloring.<br /><br />Concerns are the fillers that I see in the ingredients, brown rice and oat bran are better than wheat and corn I agree, but it still irks me that a company makes such a commitment to be organic and then uses fillers. Also, Guar Gum makes me a little nervous, though guar gum is one of those fibers that are everywhere, it is basically a thickening agent (think cornstarch) and like any fiber it has its positives along with its negatives. A plus for this brand is that its carried in my local supermarket which is very practical and the price I find reasonable for an organic brand.<br /><br />Since I don't want them to become dependent on any single brand I also feed them Natural Life (same filler issues) which they like but don't love as much as Newman's Turkey flavors. To balance my concern that perhaps there are too many carbs in their diet, I insure that the dry food I purchase is low in carbs such as Before Grain dry food."
Blue Dog Bakery Treats,Wonderful healthy dog treats that my dog absolutely loves (and she's a very picky eater).  These things smell delicious when you open the box and they are made with only natural ingredients and of course are made in the US.
i like!,"okay.  so, the flavor wears off real fast.  be forewarned about that.<br /><br />BUT-----this gum is perfect for my needs.  i had wanted something to clean my teeth/mouth in between meals (like at work after having a snack when i can't brush my teeth)  I don't intend to chew it very long so the fact that the flavor wears off fast doesn't bother me.  I answer phones at work anyway so i can't sit there chomping on gum.....<br /><br />My breath seems fresh & my mouth feels clean, so mission accomplished  :)<br /><br />One other thing i noticed that is AWESOME is that my sinuses are clearing out a lot.  I am always feeling stuffed up & have sinus problems every day. i often feel a lump in my throat when i swallow.  I have allergies & silent reflux at night so the whole area is irritated.  especially after consuming sugar, it gets worse.<br /><br />so anyway i chewed about 6 pieces of this gum today over the past 2 hrs & i feel SO much better.  I knew xylitol has anti-bacterial properties but everything i had read spoke of how good it is for your teeth. that is why i bought it. it didn't occur to me that there were other benefits. So i didn't realize when i bought the gum is that people actually use xylitol as a nasal wash & even to clear up ear infections. i discovered this only after clearly noticing the effects on myself.  it was so drastic that i did more research online (google of course).  I mean the change was so noticable for me that i thought this can't be just a coincidence & went to look it up. and lo & behold it is used to cure sinus & ear infections!  i also bought xylitol granules to use as sweetener in my tea instead of regular sugar.  now i'm going to dissolve it in mater & gargle with it too. and I will continue to use this gum every day as well."
Love this formula!,"I wanted to solely breastfeed but was unable to keep up and had to supplement formula.  I chose Similac because they are a very reputable company and I had a ton of it from the hospital.  We have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both.  He got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for 5 months and no problems.  I read some other reviews about sucrose...well, sucrose is just sugar and ALL formula has sugar in it.  Other companies just label it differently and since ths one is organic it has to contain a pure sugar.  As far as the hexane goes, I did my research, ALL formulas except one (Babys Only) use the hexane method.  Babys Only contains brown rice syrup that has been shown to have high levels of arsenic..uh, no thanks.  Also Similac has been tested and found to have no hexane present in the product.  Overall my baby is healthy and smart so I am very happy with this formula."
Maxwell Houses Tassimo French Vanilla Coffee,Coffee brewed is very tasty and the aroma enhances the room.  Guests and all enjoy and approve of this coffee.
Delicious Pumpkin Pie Mix!,"This is delicious, but I wish they would use Stevia instead of NutraSweet. I used half water and half milk instead of 4 cups of skim milk and mixed in a blender instead of mixer (add milk first). After 1 to 2 hours in the refrigerator it was set and ready to eat.<br /><br />It works well as a pudding if you don't have (or don't want) a crust.<br /><br />After the last review, I was a little concerned that I wouldn't like it. I suppose, if you like your pumpkin pie really sweet, you'll be disappointed. I like the taste of the pumpkin more than a sweet taste so I was very pleased.<br /><br />__________<br /><br />Ingredients: Whey protein concentrate, modified corn starch, pumpkin solids, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, sodium alginate, spices, calcium sulfate, sodium phosphate, aspartame*, natural and artificial flavors.<br /><br />Caramel color, FD&C Yellow #6.<br /><br />Contains milk ingredient<br />*Phenylketonurics: contains Phenylalanine<br />__________"
Not Bad for the Price,"This is a good product if you do not want to pay for the top of the line fleur du sel. The texture is more like salt chips than crystals, which leads me to think that there has been some processing to get the uniformity of color and size this product presents."
Didn't set,"I couldn't get this jel to set.  I tried two times to get this to work.  Directions are very simple so it couldn't have been user error.  Tried orange first...it set up about half way, but no where near firm.  Then I tried a box of strawberry and that was still liquid 1.5 hrs after making (box says it takes 40 minutes to set).  Would not recommend."
Greenies for Owen,Our Newf Owen is a Senior citizen now so wanted to switch him over to a treat that fit his mature lifestyle.  He loves these just as he did the regular Greenies.
Delicious Cereal,Very delicious cereal and so sweet and the pecans give it an extra special flavor and so rich.  I just wish it was available at the local supermarket!!!  One of the best cereals I have tasted in a long time and healthy too!!
Great for vegetarians,"I used this brand of mushrooms to make a delicious and ""meaty"" mushroom bourguignon. These porcinis added a very rich and complex taste to the dish and the soaking liquid is a great mushroom broth. The texture of the reconstituted mushroom is good. I originally bought these at the supermarket but this price on Amazon is about 30% cheaper. Great deal, good product."
Best gluten free pasta on the market,I have been gf for years and Tinkyada is absolutely the best gluten free pasta on the market. Even my teenagers will eat it by choice.
Fabulous Coffee!!,"I tend to be a flavored coffee drinker and I have tried many different flavors, but this is among one of my favorites. It has a great flavor and it's incredibly smooth. It's definitely deserves five stars!"
Could be better for the price,"I am a bit disappointed. If I had to choose again I would have purchased the Palacios brand. It has a better taste, and better consistency.<br />This one is Cantimpalo style, but not close to Cantimpalo at all. I would call it Chorizo Mediocre instead of Superior. I wish I could say something better, but I did not like it."
yummy selection of allergen-free lollipops,"This large container of gluten-free lollipops has been very popular at my house. It actually contains flavors that I have not seen in smaller packages of yummy earth lollipops, and those unadvertised flavors are quite yummy! I'll get these again."
reednikki71@yahoo.com,i live in Alaska and hominy is hard to found at a reasonable price. Very inexspensive and it was agreat product. i will be ordering agagin soon
Good kibble my picky Shihtzu likes before the recall,"My dog actually went through 2 bags of the lamb before it was recalled. She's on the Avoderm Grain Free Turkey now and she loves it. Even thought the NB Lamb is back on the shelf, I'm keeping her on Avoderm They have never had an issue with their dog and cat foods and NB has had a few now."
Very Good,This product was very good.  The aroma of the spices and very strong.  I added a small amount of sea salt to the chicken breast along with the spice mix and it was very flavorful.  I would order this again.
Taste good but not as good as I had hoped,If you love vegetable soup you should like this. Yes it has come chicken and large noodle type items in it too.<br />But it was not as good as I expected or hoped it would be
Great non-meat alternative,"Great, high- protein snack without meat.  I would give it 5 starts if it were not so sweet."
TREATS,I can almost hear the dogs yelling 'treats' when this cannister comes out. All the dogs absolutely love these treats!
good tuna in BPA free can,"Mostly we eat tuna in salad or heated in casserole type dishes, so the flavor is not as critical to us as it would be to some people who eat their tuna almost plain from the can.  However, when combined with chopped sweet onion, celery, olive oil and fresh lemon juice, this tuna is very tasty.<br /><br />I am willing to pay extra for this tuna mostly because of the BPA free can although the quality doesn't seem to me to be higher than other premium ""health"" brands such as Natural Sea. I have also purchased the Wild Planet brand of albacore tuna and personally prefer the taste and texture of this skipjack tuna - even though it is, as others have mentioned, quite salty tasting."
Best for my cat,Lately this all chicken pack costs more on Amazon than the chicken/turkey/beef variety pack.  My cat does best with chicken and sometimes turns her little pink nose up at the beef and turkey.  Is the chicken of higher quality than the beef and turkey and that's why the variety pack costs less?  I withhold one star because FF has by-products in it.  However this classic recipe does not have grains and it is the only cat food my girl will willingly eat day after day.
Great for crafting,I'm using these sprinkles for resin so I cannot comment on the taste or how they would stand up in baking.<br /><br />I use these inside my resin pieces to add cuteness and they work great. They are brightly colored and I love that they come in such a large package. These will last me a while.
Perfect,"Honestly, I can't understand the complaints that people have about this product. Food pops out easily (I never have to run it under hot water) and it doesn't make your hands cold. I've never noticed a chemical smell either. I always freeze up portions of what we had for dinner then bag the portions in freezer bags, which leaves the Beaba container available for the next use. And it's always being used...I love it!!!"
Outstanding Quality,"I can honestly say that I have done my research on high quality foods for my cat and dog.  Evo has the highest meat content in any dog food I've seen.  My dog loves the small bites.  It is very high in protein, so I do not recommend this to people who have little dogs unless they are very active.  I have a 8mo old Belgian Malinois and her breed needs good quality food as she is a working dog.  She did have diarreah in the beginning, but I think its because I switched it from red meat to chicken too fast.  So, if you are planning to switch to Evo, just make sure you take at least 10 days to fully switch it to Evo.  I am serious, I never wait that long, but with this high of protein, you really need to transition this food slowly.  Otherwise, your dog will have a rumbling tummy and possibly poopy accidents in your house.<br /><br />The wet food is amazing too.  It contains quality ingredients and even smells decent.  I wish more people would buy better quality food for their pets.  Its such a shame to see dogs eating Kibbles and Bits or Pedigree or basically anything you buy from Walmart or Target.  All those contain are fillers and by-products."
Great alternative for paleo or grain-free snacking,"These guys make great alternative granolas -- banana, apple, cocoa, and cappucino. Be aware that that last one contains large pieces of coffee beans, so it's not for everybody, but I sometimes appreciate that option in the afternoon at work.  Anyways, these are a tasty, filling alternative to the junk we often reach for when hungry. Highly recommend!"
Great product & price,"If your aware of the benefits of hemp oil & are looking for a pure product and great value, I definatly reccomend this hempoil from nutiva.  I prefer hemp oil to the powder, only b/c it's easier for me to squirt some of this in my ricemilk smoothie, or ontop of some veggies, or even in rice or (unbeknownst to my husband) in the caulderon of spicy indian food.  At my local health market this bottle is 25-30 dollars.  Amazon has it at a really good price.  It's the big 24 oz bottle, so your getting a good amount."
Love it!,"My five finicky guys, (dogs), love this treat.  I save the crumbs to sprinkle on their food."
Although it's a great product... it has increased from $8.32 to $14.99!!!,"I had to write something about it and let others know about the price increase...<br />""Nature's Way Organic Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce has increased from $8.32 to $14.99."" I guess there's coconut shortage."
Good Strong Mints,"Yummy, Minty... Really Minty!!  Really Yummy!!!<br /><br />The plastic packaging is a bit large for a pants or shirt pocket, but very handy for a counter desk drawer ir coat pocket. 1/2 the top of the case flips open as a lid which works well."
very good & very inexpensive,very good tatse and hot but not overwhelmingly so. i would say it is as good as hot sauces that cost 3 times a much (ie.Cholula)
Blew me away!!!,"I love pickles. I usually go for the kosher type. Love spicy things too. I was caught off guard by these. Very sweet with a good spicy kick, not too hot at all but, Wow! I can't stop sneaking over to the fridge and getting more. I am not telling my wife about them until they are almost gone. Get the big jar for only a couple of extra dollars. Do not waste your time with the small jar. I am a Chicago boy who grew up next to a wonderful pickle shop. I feel like a trader, but these are so good! I will be trying more of the flavors but the Sweet and Spicy rock."
Very good product,"These beans are very clean, washed, high quality beans. They are well packaged. I am very pleased with them.<br /><br />-Mike"
Excellent mix,Order came quickly with a large variety of flavors to try and at least two of each flavor (so you don't have to share your cup).
"My Go-To Coffee for flavor, freshness (and even social responsibility)","I didn't throw in the ""social responsibility"" factor to make up for some shortcoming in quality here.  So let's get it out of the way and get to the coffee itself.  Camano Island Roasters are committed to fair dealing with their growers, the community, and the environment.  That should matter to us all, but even if it doesn't matter to you, they still make the best coffee you can buy at any price.<br /><br />This coffee will hit your door a day after it is roasted.  It is that fresh.  And they roast it perfectly.  The Dark Sumatra is earthy, a bit smoky, and finishes incredibly smoothly.  It is a world-class cup of coffee.<br /><br />And this is a luxury you may be able to justify for every day.<br /><br />Even if you don't want to rely on mail order for all your coffee, this also makes a gift that is guaranteed to impress even the fussiest coffee drinker (and they will be especially impressed by the good the good folks at Camano intend to do).<br /><br />I love this coffee and the people who make it.  I think you will, too."
One Love Better Than It Smells,"One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost ""muddy"" odor. By ""muddy,"" I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you're looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone. A nice organic blend."
My new favorite!,"I had not heard of this brand before, and happened upon it in my local grocery store.  The lower price for a box of 12 cups made me take notice, so I thought I'd try it.  Instant coffee gratification :-)  This is a strong cup of coffee, but it's not overwhelming - at least to my taste.  I prefer some kick and this has got it.  I love the environmentally friendly pod as well.  Definitely will be subscribing and saving!"
Not very good,No problem with the order. It came on time and in good shape.<br />The product itself was not very good. The chocolate was weak and had too much creamer.<br />Will not try it again.
It's good !,"I must say I was skeptical to order caviar of fish that I don't know, I did a little bit of research and decided to give it a try.<br />Caviar came in good condition to TX, we ordered by mistake chocolate candies once and they came melted. Ha!<br />Ok, I sliced a bread, put some butter on it and this caviar, first I was surprised by some dark(navy-black) liquid on the butter that came with a caviar, ""that's artificial caviar"" first what I thought.<br />But, the taste was pretty nice, it's not a salmon caviar, of course...but for that nice price it was very good and tasty!<br />I had read the nutrition label on the box carefully, it has some color added, but nothing dangerous!<br />I think this product is good for those who love to have caviar around all the time, but don't want to spend every time $20 and up!"
Great Stuff,"This syrup is unbelievable.  I really can't tell the difference from the normal ""full sugar octane"" syrups I was used to.  Can't go wrong with this product."
"Fast, yummy, and good for you, but the packaging could use some work.","I very much enjoyed this vermicelli.  I've never had this type of noodle before, but I love how quick to prepare it is and how well it soaks up the sauce you put it in.  Its very tasty and pretty healthy to boot.<br /><br />The main problem I have with it is the packaging gives you NO clue how to prepare it.  Its very vague.  I figured it out after looking up stuff online.  I'm sure if you're used to using vermicelli this kind of thing won't bother you.  But I had never used it before, and some tips for a guy like me would've been appreciated."
Didn't like  much,"The bars have healthy ingredients but are too seedy,grainy for me. Maybe seeds could be ground for a smoother consistency."
Make it Subscribe and Save Option,"I've been eating this tuna for 6 months now. As part of a weight loss regimen, it's marvelous. An excellent source of protein combined with low calories and no added salt, you can't get a better meat source on the market.  I love that its portable.  I can take it anywhere and open and eat it on the spot."
calming herbs,"I love Anise, a soothing brew I use it in all of my teas, mixed with other calming herbs it is a good bedtime tea"
"A very nice, full flavored medium roast coffee","I prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don't.  My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or ""mouth-feel"") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a ""Starbucks-type"" of coffee too strong or bitter.  If you, like my mother, enjoy a ""regular"" blend I don't think that it get's better than this."
My Beef,"Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Original, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)<br /><br />Tough and chewiness, dry, not too salty, this is one of my favorites. Since the flavor isn't too strong, i tend to eat too much."
Cardboard,"Yuck! Tasted like cardboard, no sweetness and were just the worst cookies I have ever tasted in my life. I had such high hopes too."
Best dog's treat ever,"Charlie Bears are great.  They are especially great for smaller dog breeds.  They are delicate little crackers (much like oyster crackers you put in soup).  These treats come in a variety of flavors.  My dogs are picky and these are just about the only dog ""bisquit"" they'll eat.  You don't even have to worry about your dog's weight....these little treats are only 3 calories!  Also great for training a puppy!"
Rhubarb Spread,"I should have read the label on this: It is a spread, not jam. The flavor is acceptable, but I've been looking for a good rhubarb (not rhubarb-strawberry) jam since Bonne Maman stopped making theirs several years ago. I'm not rating my disappointment, though--even as a spread I thought this was average. I've also tried Andresy's rose jan (3 stars) and fig jam (4 stars)."
great for diabetics!,"Now, this is not rice, but can be used as a rice like product for soups or items with sauces.  Perfect rice substitute for diabetics!"
good replacement,"My wife never liked the smell of my Mennen, but I could never find a substitute that worked. The Axe does: it's a mild scent and does the antiperspirant job well."
HORRIBLE doesn't begin to describe this product!  Very disappointed!,"The product description says: ""Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange.""<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful. Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a ""taste test"" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-("
treats for my sweets,"I have 2 Bichon Frise's, one 15 and 11.  Because these treats are small and chewy, they are perfect for them.  Sometimes we crumle them into their food to get them to eat.  We continue to use this product.  I guess I am speaking for them, Snoopy is the male and Abby the female."
Very Disappointed in the Flavor,"Totally do not like the flavor of this coffee on it's own. It smells great when you first puncture the k-cup, but then it's all down hill from there.  It's fruity, no nuttiness at all, with a strange aftertaste, and kind of weak on a 6oz brew.  It works fine with a cocoa for a mocha, but not good at all by itself.  This is coming from someone who likes the ""Dark Magic"" and ""Double Black Diamond"" k-cups."
Maple Chai?!?,"This chai has all the flavors that traditionally belong in a good chai, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, etc. Then there's the overpowering flavor of maple so strong that you could sweeten it and pour it over pancakes!<br /><br />This stuff is foul and I'm very glad it was so inexpensive, although twelve bucks for a pound of garbage really isn't that inexpensive when you think about it.<br /><br />Anyway... it's a sixteen ounce package of nasty and I wish I could get my money back on it. Lesson learned."
Yummy treat,"Dog loves them.  Molly is small so I have to cut treats to more manageable size, but bag will last longer! They are made in China..wish I had seen that.  It is a concern, but I've only read that chicken jerky from China is the problem...I hope."
Good stuff,Great refreshing drink. Replenishes electrolytes naturally after workout.  Quenches thrust much better than water and all naturally rather then all the junk in sports drinks.  Tastes good too.
Dogs go nuts for these liver treats,"When I first go my Havanese puppy 1 1/2 years ago, the breeder suggested these liver treats for using when training.  My dog will do ANYTHING for these treats.  They even use them at the name brand pet hotel we use in Phoenix.  You have to be careful not to give too much, but my dog, Tanner, got over his separation anxiety when I started the routine of asking for a kiss, then giving him a treat and then leaving.  Now he just wants the treat, I have to beg for the kiss."
would not recommend,"I was sent the incorrect product and have never received EMERGEN-C. It is considered a food and nonreturnable.<br /> I did take a packet of Emergen -C Multi Vitamin and had the unpleasant and immediate symptoms of a headache and a racing heart. Since digging deeper into the ingredients I have decided to switch to a much ""healthier"" alternative called ULTIMA replenisher with NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS, FLAVORS OR SWEETENERS."
Awesome pancake mix,"Just finish eating my pancake, and it was amazing. I follow the instruction to make it on the sides of the bag, and it was yummy. I will def be buying these things from now on."
Weak Taste and smell,"I didn't care for this blend because for a extra bold, it had a weak taste.  Its hard to explain but a bold and extra bold has a dark, rich taste to it, and this blend was disappointing.  I was just missing that bold flavor.  It tasted like McDonald's coffee that has been sitting for an hour.  The smell was also weak."
"Good taste, but not perfect","Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work."
Definitely the FINAL answer (for now),"I started with tabasco sauce at age 5, worked my way to jalapenos in my teens, then habaneros, and finally the ghost chili in my 20s. I am always on the hunt for the next HOTTEST sauce as i keep killing my taste buds on this stuff. The last sauce I rolled the dice on was the Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce and it was fantastic. I thought ghost peppers would be the hottest thing until I got my hands on this little tiny bottle called Da Bomb - The Final Answer. Hmmmm... made from Habaneros and pepper extract? It couldn't be too bad I thought. Like a champ I put a dime sized blob on a chip and tossed it in my mouth. After a few chews my parents asked me ""Well how is it?"" I tried to talk and realized once this bad boy goes aerosol or you breathe it you're done. ""It's goo.... *cough* *cough*"" My eyes began to water and the heat took over. This stuff is not a joke, not a game. Over the past year my mouth and tongue has become desensitized to it and I can eat it no problem but the intestines never lie. It feels like the devil himself is laughing while he crawls through your colon, clawing you from within. Do NOT attempt to eat this on an empty stomach. In a pathetic attempt to show off to co-workers I brought it to work and we all tried some before lunch. After a few minutes I felt as if a fiery ulcer had erupted and had to chug about 3 Sodas before it subsided. This is the hottest stuff i've found to date... yet i'm still on the hunt. Use at your own... misguided risk."
thrilled by the mistake,"What happened was I ordered Coconut butter.. Never had cashew butter before in my life. So when i Got it I was like, WHat the heck!! But I decided to try it, Wish I had a camera on my face, cause I was INLOVE the second I tried it, so incredibly creamy... This is something I want to have on hand always.. I love the people at Artisan, they are very sweet, it's professional AND Courteous..<br />  It was a mistake that I benefited from Greatly!! Try it, you will LOVE IT!!"
quality food for less,"this food gets an A rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range. however, it's about $8 more here on amazon than at the local pet store (after a 9.25% sales tax)"
"Look nice, but 3/5 broken in shipment","I suppose these might taste good, as I will know after I open them.  For right now, I will keep the five of them together to look good, but 3 out of the 5 were broken upon opening the box.  The box looked good and it doesn't appear they went through too much shaking or anything, they just are so fragile, they can't make it through shipment.  So needless to say, I recommend getting more than one package if you really want these for something special (birth of my son) and want to be able to hand any out."
"Rapid Shipping, Great Product too.","I ordered this at 3pm one afternoon and it was at my home by 3pm the next day even though I only selected two day shipping. Rapid shipment=happy me!! Also, I like this Stevia as it is organic. With stevia, it is a bit of a different taste from your standard sweetener - but way more natural than anything else one can buy other than dates! Dates wouldn't sweetened my coffee very well either. We use this mostly in our morning coffee but for other uses as well (iced tea, etc)."
I wanted to like these,"I bought a couple of these 4-packs, but about 50% of the crusts came already torn into two or three pieces.  Another unrelated 50% smell REALLY bad but have no visible mold or anything.  Some of them are just fine though.  Also, refrigerating them immediately after receipt did not help.<br /><br />I prefer Boboli pizza crusts.  I can buy both brands locally, but Boboli is easier to find and because the back side of the packaging is fully transparent, it is easier to check for damage before buying."
"Pups say ""Great stuff""","My grandpuppies love this stuff, & it's very hard to find in my area. Haven't tried it myself, but they think it's tops."
Goooood stuff,All of your yeast breads will be improved by using gluten.  I add two teaspoons for a one pound loaf.  Even if you use bread flour add the gluten.  I keep mine in the freezer because it will go rancid.  But it seems to stay good in freezer -- never had any go bad since I've been freezing it.  Caution:  if you spill some in the sink or wipe up with a wet rag you have a huge sticky mess.  Try not to spill it.
BE CAREFUL,"I took the pill (3x3)two days only but had to stop because my baby started having runny stool ( like diarrhea).  I wish I could take it longer to see if it worked or not! So keep an eye on your baby , you dont want her to get diarrhea.  Unfortunatey, It could be one of the side effects..."
"Like the flavor, but not the after taste","Ok, so I tried the Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai flavor. While I liked the Strawberry Acai flavor in and of itself, I did NOT like the after taste left behind. It uses sucralose as a sweetener and I just don't like the ""coating of the tongue"" effect you get from that. I don't drink diet beverages normally, so I might just be more sensitive to the sucralose. I suppose if you are one who drinks diet beverages normally you would probably not notice the after taste that most diet beverages leave. I would love if they made this product with real sweeteners and not artificial."
Best Tasting Packing Peanuts Out There,"Okay: I haven't ever actually tasted packing peanuts.  But I would be willing to bet that they taste and share the same texture that these grub-shaped extrusions do.<br /><br />I can't believe how popular these are, actually.  I'm not a particularly picky eater.  I will even eat rice cakes, which are pretty Styrofoamy.  But these are really unpleasant.<br /><br />The ""flavor"" is a combination of something synthetic and inedible, with occasional hints of stale cornmeal, combined with a faint moldy cheese taste.  The bizarre texture triggers an instinctive ""don't eat this--it isn't food"" response.  The individual bits look disconcertingly similar to those large, ""C"" shaped June beetle grubs one occasionally digs up in the garden.  I bet those taste better.  This product fails on any aspect of ""appeal"" on every point.<br /><br />If you find these tasty, I'm betting you are either (a) high; (b) drunk; or (c) 7 years old and the only other thing you eat is bologna.  I kid; I kid.  :)"
My wife and I love these!,"My wife loves these, and we can't wait for them to go on sale again.  Recommended!"
Really great product!,"Purchased this as a gift for a couple of salt loving friends - It is great and attractive! A note to purchasers: we had one vial of the salt arrive empty and it says no returns, if you contact the seller directly they will work with you. The seller send me a replacement vial (very quickly) and even sent a cool little salt dish along with it.  Will definitely get this set for others (maybe even me) in the future."
The Best,"What they say is true, it's just 100 packets in a box, but hey-- it's 100 packets  for a fair price. :)"
Valentine gift,The bearS were great and the thought an concept was excellent what brought the rating down for me were the treats.  They were reported to me as being not that good
the best coffee..the best deal,"I like strong black coffee. I like it to taste strong, have body, & wake me up. The way to make strong coffee is use more grounds per water, but that doesn't guarantee it tastes good . ""Jet Fuel"" tastes good & wakes me up. It seems at least a time-&-a-half stronger than most other coffees, is full-bodied, &  is consistently, equally great cup after cup: I've had a hundred of them so far. It's my favorite. I bought 50 cups on sale for $20, but the regular price at the time was only $21! Since you'll probably only need one cup in the morning, it's a great deal. Also: It arrived less than 48 hours after the order was put in"
Really works for hayfever (allergies)...,Was told by a friend to try Nettle tea for allergies. Brought it & it works great & quickly. Long time allergy suffer who loves Nettle tea. I'm able to use it & stopped all the other medications....
Marie Sharp's is the best,"My husband and I first tried Marie Sharp's sauces when we traveled to Belize.  We quickly used up what we bought and brought back with us, so I am happy that we can find it online.  The sauces add kick to dishes (some flavors are VERY HOT-beware!), but I like that you don't get that vinegary taste that you get with so many hot sauces (like Tabasco)."
five stars,These crackers are extremely flavorful and taste great.  They are also gluten free and low fat.  This combination is very hard to find.
Melted Mess!,"I received the package with melted pieces, some that weren't all the way wrapped, and almost all chocolate and bananna. The plastic bag they were in, inside the box was ripped open.  I was so dissappointed, salt water taffy is a favorite treat! I suppose that's what I get for ordering it online."
Great coating for chicken!,I don't like to take the time to make the sauce with the coconut milk so I have started taking some of the spice in a ziplock bag and dropping my chicken legs or thighs to coat the chicken.  If fry it just like it is. It makes a great coating. Very tasty!
klein' s sesame almonds,"i thought they were as good as the traders joe almonds, but because of the free shipping i ordered, but when i tasted them , they were a little over bake for me. then, they only have little sesame, i will not buy this product again"
Great!!!!!,This product taste amazing along or on waffles or toast. I love to just eat it plain out of the jar.
Awesome popcorn!,"Purchased this to make Poppy Cock - which it was wonderful for, but have found that husband and I love it for eating popcorn as well.  Has more chew."
Great tasting and easy to use,"This product is great. I have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea. So many of the teas are sweetened with Splenda type sweeteners and I prefer to use Stevia. The Jackie Chan green tea appears to have been discontinued.<br /><br />I mix this product and love the taste. A little lemon and Stevia and I have the perfect evening iced tea. It provides all the benefits of green tea, and the instant convenience.<br /><br />I give it five stars"
This treat gets FOUR PAWS UP = our guys LOVE them!,"(This is the same review I posted for the ""Big Boyz"" size of this product) ...<br /><br />We have three dogs, and one is a bit of a ""picky"" eater, and I have given Sam's Yams to ALL of them, with no complaints and wagging tails from everyone. I didn't want to have the mess on the rugs (or smell) of real rawhide, and I didn't want to worry about bone chips with regular bone treats. These are our guys' FAVORITE treat, hands down. To make them last longer overall, you can bend and break them into small pieces (which I always do), and simply give them as a smaller treat, vs. giving them the entire 'slice' of sweet potato as they come packaged in the bag. Even though they don't last for hours like a ""rawhide"" does, I just don't care. I've had my fill of trying to keep the dogs in one tiled area with their chews / bones so that they don't get crud on the carpet or rugs (that I have to clean!). With this product, you have: (1) a super healthy treat (2) something that doesn't have the risk of bone chips (although of course, I don't give them these treats and leave the house -- and I don't do that with any treat) (3) a treat that does NOT stain the carpet or rugs (at ALL!), or rub off or stain your dog's fur (4) a treat that is made from dried sweet potatoes and ONLY that ... no preservatives, no 'animal parts', no artificial colors, no chemicals, no other ""mystery"" ingredients that you can't identify - just 100% dried sweet potatoes. I've checked around and Amazon seems to have the best price - I recommend these VERY highly (and I would say that our dogs all agree!)"
These cookies are $2.19 in my SuperMarket,We were buying Bahlsen cookies at $1.70-$2.19 at lockal supermarket until I found that they are $1.41/box here at Amazon!
Absolutely delicious,We were ready when the box came and quickly opened it to inspect the cookies...the ride in the mailman's truck made them a little soft where the cookie part had separated from the marshmallow when I tried to pick one up...not a problem we placed them in the fridge for a awhile then they were perfect.  Kind of on the small side (compared to Pinwheels) IMO they taste SOOOO much better.  The chocolate seems nicer than on Pinwheels and it seemed like semi-sweet and we found them tasty....so much so we ate the whole box within 30 minutes!<br /><br />Wish I had another box....
She just doesn't want it,"I was given a bottle of the savory bacon flavor for the purpose of trying it out and reviewing it. I've tried on several occasions both with the bottle and with putting some on my fingers in case it was how it is dispensed that was bugging her and my dog just wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the concept is interesting and also because my dog is very picky. It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as ""I hate it.""<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon."
Cinnamon Citrus Tea,"As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.<br /><br />This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
Belch juice,"That's what I would've called it.<br /><br />Anyways, there's not much to describe as it tastes exactly like you are probably imagining.  Cherry flavored juice with added carbonation.  I admit I was curious to see what 100% carbonated juice would taste like as opposed to something like a lemon-lime soda that contains almost all water and almost no juice.  My first impression is that they made a good decision in keeping the carbonation lighter than the average soda (still enough for a belch or two).  My second impression is 100% juice just doesn't taste good carbonated.  I think I would have preferred the juice just by itself.  Finally, at approximately one dollar per can I would most likely skip this for a sixteen ounce bottle of juice at roughly the same price if I were in the grocery aisle."
Great Substitute For Starbucks' Iced Green Tea Latte,"I was >addicted&lt; to Starbucks' green tea lattes, but at $3.45 a pop for a small, I started thinking that maybe I should look into something else. I'm not a tea expert, but this tea is really delicious! Whether you add milk (I usually add soy milk) or just water, this become a truly refreshing treat that is not too sweet. I recommend buying just one box of this item before buying the four-box-pack that comes from Amazon. If you do decide that you like it, then committing to the four boxes won't be hard! I'm about to run out of supply, so I will be ordering another four boxes soon hehe"
Perfect!,"My husband and I use about 4 k cups a day, sometimes a little less or a little more, give or take. I was looking for something that is compact and holds a lot because of my limited counter space. We have the keurig b-40. This pod holder is very well constructed, compact and holds a lot of k cups. Sits nicely next to the keurig and has a flat top so you can put the sugar bowl or splenda packets- or whatever on top of it. Love it and worth every penny!"
I AM FINALLY A GREEN TEA LOVER!,"Green tea is suppose to be the best tea for you. I have tried many and just did not like them at all. Then I tried Republic of Tea Matcha Tea. Expensive but pretty good whenI brewed it WITH a black tea bag as well. But, I figured I was getting the green tea in there so better that way than not at all. I decided to check Amazon to see if I could get that tea cheaper and it is there that I found the reviews for this tea. I just got the box this week and I am so happy. I don't need to brew the black tea with it. It is GOOD! Very good. And a lot cheaper than Republic of Tea. (The price of this tea seems to fluctuate, though. It has actually dropped in price since I ordered it 4 days ago by $5.00. Wonder why?)"
AWESOME!,Calms VERY WELL.  Tastes great with honey but that's a personal choice.  Best stuff!  Can't wait to try their other teas!
"This is heavy, Doc!","According to the box, you could win a trip to the 2004 Daytona 500. THE 2004 DAYTONA 500! So not only does this box contain delicious cake, but it's also a frickin' time machine! Huzzah!"
chinese elm tree,"came on time- Nothing has sprouted yet, unfortunately. I really want all my elm trees to come out and grow to fruition."
"""POP-GARLIC"" YOU WILL BE VERY DISSAPOINTED","This has got to be the worst chopped garlic I have ever used, and I've been cooking over 50 years!  It's like a paste rather than chopped, with a consistency of pudding. The worst part is the garlic explodes like popcorn when you saute it in oil. It shoots oil and garlic about a foot in the air and, if you do not cover the pan, it will burn you. It even explodes in prepared foods that need to be fried, like meatballs. KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
Great Tea,A well flavored Tea for after dinner or to use when you have trouble sleeping. I have purchaced this enjoyable tea twice from amazon. I highly recommend this Tea.
Smells good,"Smells good, makes me feel clean, feels good while applying to my body in the shower. Never thought I would be reviewing shower gel but Amazon sent me an email to do so....and I do everything Amazon says. This is good stuff thought. I also have the other varieties and they all are nice."
Not bad,"I got 2 packs of these.  One for a friend who is a huge fan of Dr. Who and one for me (out of curiosity).  I liked them, they are cover in a powdered sugar and very flavorful.  My wife however, hated them.  I suspect she was expecting more sugary sweet American type gummi type candy.  These are more fruity, less sugary."
Way too expensive for 2 oz.,"It's not ""gold plated"".  It's too expensive for 2 oz.  They want almost $10.00 for shipping to boot!  I bought 6 oz., 3 times that amount for less than what they want for 2 oz from Swanson's,  and they charge $5.00 for shipping total for all you want to buy on your order."
yummy!!!,"I love the mango macadamia nut flavor. It's sweet with a little crunch, plus vitamin D and calcium. And great also since it's gluten and dairy free. The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is that I cannot eat most flavors since I cannot eat almonds. I'm hoping someday there will be more almond-free flavors."
Yummy!,"At first, I didn't realize Annie's offers GF bunnies and was delighted to discover them while browsing through GF foods on Amazon. They taste great, and look just like the regular flour/wheat snacks. My kids are able to enjoy GF bunnies just like their friends( regular wheat).  I just wished they have different packaging to distinguish flour/wheat bunnies from GF bunnies. It will makes shopping easier for sure."
Russian?  Well...sort of...,"I ordered this tea along with several other Roland tinned teas.  This was the best of the lot, though that's not saying much.  From what I've experienced and what I've seen in some other reviews of Roland teas, the flavoring is really weak on all of their flavored teas.  Well, OK, faint is perhaps being to kind.  Non existent is really more correct.  Russian tea is supposed to have a smokey taste that some people are put off by.  The flavor of this tea is very faint, fainter than I was expecting and fainter than I would have liked.  The other Roland teas I got were disappointingly weakly flavored and weren't worth getting.  This one at least has some flavor."
Breakfast fast,Great snack or breakfast for anyone on the good. Great for kids before school. Tastes like homemade banana nut bread. Would definitely buy again.
Nighty Night tea,Another great product from Traditional Medicine. There are no dull hangover effects in the morning as I have found with medications.
I requested a refund,"This cinnamon has no taste at all.  It smelled a little like a cinnamon candy, but on oatmeal it had no flavor (other than an unusual aftertaste).  Thankfully products purchased from Amazon have a great refund/return policy.  On a positive note, the cinnamon arrived quickly and was sealed inside of the jar.  Maybe I received a bad batch?  I would not purchase again and will end up discarding what I have left.  Unfortunate."
Great Tasting Treat!,I love these snack bars so much...I just finished eating one!  I recommend you give them a try. Great tasting...I love them.
Delicious!,"Chocolate and more chocolate... what's not to like?  These are so good.  They're very rich so you can't eat more than one or two at a time, but that is probably a good thing or you'd want to devour the whole package.  They're that good.  I will definitely buy these again and you'll feel the same way!"
No Worries!,"Love these - perfection would be if it made no mess. They're delicious, just 'crumby'. They break apart into tiny pieces when you take a bite, can stain clothes if you don't know the crumbs are there.<br />Eat on the go with caution :-)"
yummy for your tummy,"The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips."
never lumpy,This baking powder has no aluminum and it always does a good job.The product stayes fresh when stored in a glass jar with lid. I have been using this product for almost a year.
Delicious...,I love PopChip  Products in general.  Having  a sweet potato variety debut  w  especially  welcome.  I love sweet potatoes and chips made from them.  Excellent flavor and texture.
why ruin it with additives,Why ruin great Irish oatmeal with additives that could be derived from GMO sources. It popped up in my recommended items and I ordered it without checking ingredients. Big mistake. I can't risk eating it since I can't eat anything from GMO corn or soy.There are other good organic oatmeals out there that don't add questionable ingredients.
yummiest candies ever!!,Ate them at a local thai restaurant. My wife wanted them so badly. Finally got them from amazon. They are just amazing !!!
Not impressed - food coloring in dog food?!?,"Our dogs ate this food perfectly fine, but then again, they eat just about anything. We have a Weimaraner and a Husky. Both seem to love the smell and dove right in. My husband said he thought he saw some of the big chewy pieces in the dogs' poop the next day...maybe they aren't getting digested fully?<br /><br />I, like other reviewers, wasn't impressed with the ingredients list. Lots of soy and corn and by-products. Also, they have added colors! Really? Who is eating this...dogs! Dogs don't need colored bits. This is dog food being marketed toward humans who like colors. Silliness.<br /><br />The ""chewy"" bits are more rubbery feeling than ""tender"" and ""meaty"". Also, it seems pretty expensive for something that is loaded with soy and corn and by-products. The more I think about it and write this review the more I'm thinking it's more like a 2-star dog food. Not impressed."
Great Coffee!,This is really good coffee.  Nice rich flavor.  Not bitter.  If you don't like strong coffee you may want to pick a different roast.
Good tea.,"This is good loose leaf tea and the packaging makes this tea a very good purchase. There are three packages so while using one the other two stay fresh, the package has a zip lock thing to help preserve freshness and the bottome is fasioned so that it can stand up like in the picture. The tea itself is very good, but you must remember that this is Jasmine green tea... All in all I am happy with the purchase."
Kelloggs Rice Krispies-gluten-free,This is the first time I have seen gluten-free rice krispies. Being gluten-free is not an easy task and some of the foods are almost not palatable so to find something that both looks and tastes good really helps a person with Celiac disease. Loved them.
Hard to find and addictive.,My wife was addicted to the sugary version of these and she has always hated the taste/aftertaste of any artificial sweeteners. Now that she has tried this sugar free version she is just as addicted but taking in less calories. I can't explain the reviewer who developed illness and thinks the candies are the cause. My wife has the most sensitive stomach and digestive tract and these do not bother her at all. In fact the reason she has always eaten the Star Brite or Starlight mints is that they help settle her stomach. She suffers from diverticulitis and is prone to attacks of diarrhea so she doesn't go anywhere without these mints. The sugar free version is very difficult to find locally so I'm thrilled to buy them buy the case on Amazon.
oh my goodness!!!!!!,"well whats to say, they are the best no wheat, no suger, no dairy cookies i have ever had.  in fact they could hold there own against a regular fat & suger filled cookie!!!"
"Taste of ""Honey""","This is the best honey I have ever tasted. I have tried many other types of honey, but nothing compares to ""Langnese Acacia Honey."" It is clear and smooth and does not leave an aftertaste. I recommend it highly."
What a great idea!!,"I'm a coffee lover, always have been and I love to ""make"" things. So when I read about homeroasting the first time I thought... 'sure I can spare some time for that from my wine making/ beer brewing/ home remodeling/ motorcycling and tournament fishing schedule'.<br />So where did I get: a coffee roaster, green coffee beans, and a coffee bean grinder? and... 'how would I decide what kinds to buy?<br />Amazon, of course! I read a bazillion reviews and settled on this Green Unroasted Coffee Bean Sampler and a Whirley-Pop popcorn popper, and I'm so glad I did. This sampler is a great way to familiarize oneself with the process of home roasting. I would have hesitated forever about buying green coffee beans in bulk. Vacillating endlessly over what regions beans are the 'best' to try when you're forced to buy minimum weights of 5 lbs or more or spend way more dollars for single pound packaging. I might have never actually gotten around to choosing based on an uninitiated wannabe home roasters desire to 'try' something...but HEY! Amazon has this great variety of green beans in a sampler with enough beans in each bag to get a real feel for what I like or don't and WoW! it's affordable enough that I'm sure I'll find something in the variety that will make me happy I chose to go forward with this and...if I don't? Well, I didn't spend so much getting started that I'd feel I'd wasted money ..or energy.<br />My opinion is that this is a great idea and an easy way for newly interested roasters to try many regional coffees in convenient volumes. If you are a coffee aficionado and know exactly what to expect from each regional variety buy what you like best in bulk and save even more, but if you're like me wanting to try many different varieties, I recommend this sampler. I've found that I love to roast my own. I love to share it with friends and I've already recommended it a couple times. I'll be back to buy it again as gifts for like- minded souls."
NOT Post Fortified Oat Flakes,"These Oat Bran Flakes do NOT, I repeat, do NOT taste like Post Fortified Oat Flakes. I was so hoping that they would, but alas, they do not. Anyone who says they do, can't remember what Fortified Oat Flakes taste like. Oh well, the search continues for my long gone favorite cereal..."
Really decent dog food,"I mix in a little of this with our puppy's dry food, and she LOVES it.  I like that it has decent ingredients.  It doesn't smell appetizing to me, but it does to her!  We've paired this along with Diamond Naturals Puppy Food, and she is one happy, active little puppy.  Will definitely continue to buy this!"
Just dreadful!,"I love chocolate and have had some of the best.  I feel pretty naive to believe I could have gotten anything like that for $17 for 2 pounds.  These were old and waxy.  They were white with age, the dark chocolate that is, and just awful.  I took a bite of a couple different kinds and they all were not edible in my opinion.  Even ghiardelli is better than these!"
I love these.,"This are so good the little ones are the best and there hard to find in San Diego, Ca. They only thing is there expensive at this place wish they would cut you a better deal. But will still buy from time to time."
Flavor ok but they do not fit right,"I ordered these because the price seemed good. I didn't care so much that they weren't the same as regular K-Cups as people said they fit. They do not. On our brewer, you have to hold the handle down because the cup doesn't fit all the way down into the holder. I like to do other things while I'm brewing the coffee knowing it will be ready when I'm ready to grab it. Not so with this one. You have to babysit the machine.  We have a B-40.<br /><br />I will not buy again. THEY DO NOT FIT!"
Great Nuts,I received these nuts sooner that I had ever expected.  They were fresh and nice and plump and very yummy!!  I am going to order more. Don't pass up this great offer!!!
Best ever,Add a little creamer & sugar for the best tasting tea.  My kids smelled it and thought they were smelling candy.  Great spices!!!
Beef Straganoff,"January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars."
She loves it!,"I'm not sure what is about this food, but my dog absolutely loves it!! So much so that she sniffs at her other food and will root around to get the last pieces of Chef Michael's. What I noticed immediately is that it smells like human food and has a soft, moist texture. The bag was easy to open and easy to reseal. I'm not sure if I can find this food yet in my area, but after the response my dog had, I think I'm going to have to, as she wants nothing to do with her old food!"
Pretty good product for the price,"It's nice having the smoked salmon in vacuum pouches for shipping. Lots easier to ship without bulky cans to deal with. I send several packs to my mother a couple of times a year since she's too far away for her to sample my own smoked salmon, so it's a tradeoff and she enjoys the convenience of the smaller packages.  Not a lot of smoke flavor, but acceptable and still nutritious."
2 points per cup!,"I found this cereal about a month ago and it has become one of my favorite snacks! If you are counting calories or familiar with Weight Watchers it has 2 points for a cup, which is incredible for cereal, let alone one that tastes this great! Yum- I love it for snacks and in a bowl with almond milk- it rocks!"
I do love cookies!,"There are some days that I just need a pic me up. That's usually when I turn to something chocolatey, usually in the form of a cookie or cupcake. I signed up for the Cookie Athlete ""Cookie of the Month club"".<br /><br />I have loved getting gourmet cookies shipped right to my front door. I live in a small town, and I don't like store bought cookies. I know cookies, and when they are gross, they aren't worth the calories, but all in all I have been impressed with the cookies I have received (I'm on month 3 now!). I did count my cookies....I got between 1 dozen up to 15 cookies per box so far, but they have been worth every penny!<br /><br />To be honest, I've been thinking that this might be a fun gift to give all my girlfriends for Christmas! They are so hard to buy for....who doesn't love cookies?"
Eating it for years.,"I found out about this rice about 3 years ago, and i have'nt went back to regular rice since. The flavor is second to none. It might be a little more expensive than regular rice, but it's worth it. You won't be dissapointed."
White wheat flour--who knew.,I love this product for just about anything.  The only time I had any issue was making a cake and forgot it is just A BIT heavier than regular flour.  To say the cake was dense is a real understatement.<br /><br />My grandkids think that Mema makes the best cinnamon rolls and cookies ever so must be using the right stuff after all.  This flour rocks the biggest problem is the issue of finding it available locally.  Keep up the good work.
Awesome!,"I ate the whole bag in like 6 hours, then went to the hospital and had a stroke.  SO AMAZINGly good candy."
Wonderful tasting coffee,"My husband used to like the Nantucket Blend saying that it was awesome.  Then he tried this one, and it's the only one he drinks.  I drink other flavors, but I like taking sips of this one for sure...my husband is very territorial over these cups and says it's the only one he drinks.  If you're a coffee drinker, definitely try this one!"
Too strong/Same taste as Organic with the yellow cap,"This brew is just Ok I will not buy again. I love the packaging, less waste and cups brew just like original keurig. The taste however was not to my liking. It was just like the organic blend with the yellow lid except with a little less bitterness and just a little less burned taste. The aroma and basic taste however were the same. I read on here in another review that they may stop making that brew so if you liked it this will be a very good alternative for you. But for me this is not pleasant. I may try another flavor because I do like the packaging. That is the reason for the three stars not the coffee.."
"Weak, tho tasty","I read some of the other reviews here and decided to try putting a pod in my espresso machine. Worked fine, except the coffee was not very dark. Then I took the pod and dropped it into the coffee to make it darker. Still weak. This is the same problem I have with all the pod/cup/premeasured coffees. While I do know people who drink coffee brewed like this, it's not strong enough for my taste, and I think most people's. The flavor is good, would be delicious if strong, so maybe next time I will use two pods. However, the price is kind of high if you have to use two pods per cup.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today, I tried using two pods and boiling them in a cup of water, thinking it might work for camping. Still weak. I think you'd need two pods and half a cup, 4oz or so. I noticed that the coffee does not taste full-bodied. It could be dried out from all the processing -- ground coffee should probably be stored in a packed brick, not individual, non-vacuum-packed packets. Oh well."
Protein Chips,"These are great taste and makes a great replacement for potato chips. These are not full of fat, they are full of protein! I will order again."
Great product,"I purchased these chews on the recommendation of my vet.  I have been very pleased with the results.  The plaque that was present on my dog's teeth was quickly removed and my dog absolutely loves them.  The only downside is that they do stink, but it's not that bad. I highly recommend these dog treats."
The COFFEE!,"Excellent coffee. Aroma, Flavor, Body are exceptional. The best brand I found for my morning Turkish coffee. Strongly recommend it for serious coffee lovers."
Larry,I really liked the regular so I thought I would try the Chocolate and it's almost as good as the regular smooth. It's just a little more liquid and you need to stir it.
Wonderful Vanilla Beans!,I have to agree with most everyone else's reviews.  These are really wonderful.  I had them laying on my counter for a number of days before using them but they made my kitchen smell absolutely divine.<br /><br />They are much more pleasing to the eye than the tiny amount of dry shriveled up very expensive few you can buy in a jar at a grocery store.  These are moist and plump.<br /><br />100 percent vanilla extract has become so expensive it makes me cringe so I am using these vanilla beans to make my own extract (lifetime supply?). You can find recipes to make your own extract online.  It's very easy to make but you do have to let in sit for about 8-12 weeks. This would made wonderful gifts when finished. I am also using it to flavor sugar and plan to us it homemade ice cream this summer.<br /><br />I have bought food items from this seller before. They are very reliable and you get what you order in the mail very quickly.  I have really been surprised by how quickly I have received my orders from them.  Wonderful products AND service.
High Fructose Corn Syrup!,"Although this product tastes good and has a decent amount of fiber, it's sweetened with HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.  HFCS, which is present is many processed foods and drinks, is suspected of slowing metabolism, contributing to high triglyceride levels, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and obesity.  Read a comprehensive article about the dangers of HFCS here:  [...]<br /><br />I prefer to steer clear of HFCS as I believe it's unhealthy.  Therefore, I purchase Nature's Path Organic Smart Bran as my breakfast cereal.  It doesn't contain any High Fructose Corn Syrup ~ just organic evaporated cane juice as the sweetener.  The taste is GREAT and each serving contains 51% of the RDA of fiber!"
Delicious!!,Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!
OIL! OIL! OIL!,"Smothered in oil is the only way to describe these Cashews.  It looks nothing like the picture online, there is messy, oily goo on the inside of the container from all that oil.  Haven't you ever heard about DRY roasting?  I prefer to have no salt, but what's the use when you drown the &$#@!ig things in Oil!? Cashews contain enough natural oils. Stop soaking them in additional oil!  I ordered these only because my regular brand was sold out on Amazon.  What a disappointment!  I will continue to order Cashews from Amazon, but not this brand."
price gouging,frito lays sell these 2 for $1 ...it says it on the picture and confirmed at my local store...amazon needs to protect it's customers from being robbed by these criminals....
pretty good item,"I would give this product 5 stars for the fact that it's made in the US & not China, like so many Xylitol products. However I wasn't too fond of the chocolate flavor, and I'm a chocoholic. I preferred the berry flavor as far as being refreshing, but that is just a personal taste matter. Bottom line: this is a quality product at a reasonable price, compared to so many of the other ""dry mouth"" specialty products."
Much better than expected!,"Kellogg's Crunchy Nut: Roasted Nut & Honey<br /><br />Much better than expected!  I generally don't gravitate towards the 'O' shaped cereals, my favorite cereal is Honey Bunches of Oats.  That being said, when I saw this Nut & Honey cereal, I figured I'd give it a try.  It's tastier than I imagined, it has a stronger honey flavor than most honey-flavored cereals do.  The 'enlarged' picture of the cereal on the box makes it look like there's more nut 'shavings' than there really are, but that being said, there's enough nut there to make a difference and have the cereal taste slightly nutty, which is a good thing in my opinion.  ...I'm not one to eat (or snack on) dry cereal, but this one makes the cut, it's currently sitting next to me on the desk."
"well priced, good value","Great product, roasts up nicely,  Good price compared to grocery store. This is all I use anymore. Flavor is great, smokey and chocolatey. Makes a very nice cup of expresso."
A Southerner who uses Lipton,"I use the store bought Lipton (less than $2 for a 100 ct).<br />To make GA style sweet tea, boil water in a small saucepan.<br />Once it's at a rolling boil, turn the heat off and place 5-6 bags in the pan and let steep for about 5 minutes.<br />Remove the bags once the water is dark brown.<br />Pour over 1 c. sugar in a gallon pitcher. Stir to dissolve sugar.<br />Fill the rest of the way with water and stir.<br />You can add more sugar if you like it sweeter (we sometimes use 1 3/4 c sugar).<br />This tea is delicious, and not-sickly-sweet. Secret to sweet tea is to dissolve the sugar in hot water."
Best Tastin,This is the best tasting sugar free shortbread cookie ever. Doesn't even taste sugar free.
sesame awesome and chicken pot water,"The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the ""chicken pot pie"" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up."
Why so much?,I love Mio but I am confused as to why a pack of 4 costs $22 on amazon.com and people are buying it.  They are $3.65 each at my local Target store.  That would mean that it costs just under $15 for me to go and buy four.  Why are people ordering it online?  Unless I am missing something and you really get more than 4 individual bottles.
5-Hour Energy Review,"It may help you in the short run but it does damage to your heart in the long run. It also taste awful this side of Cherry 7Up. By the way,Yes I did drank this stuff so you can't say I never had this before. I give this 1 out of 10."
Healthy? Yes. Crunchy? You betcha. Tasty? Sort of....,"My last purchase of raw pumpkin seeds was from a different seller/brand and they were delicious. I went with this brand this time, mainly due to the price. The reason these are much less flavorful is because they have NO SALT. I understand that salt is unhealthy in large amounts, but I dont have a heart condition (yet) and I like a little salt on nuts.<br /><br />The seller needs to include important info like that so that people can know what they are getting. I will of course eat these, and they would go great in home made trail mix, but I will be salting the ones I eat by themselves."
Gentle On My Scalp,"I have oily hair and have been told to use shampoo for dry hair so as to reach a medium.  In other words, use a shampoo for the opposite hair type you have.  I found that interesting and logical sounding and I've tried it, but the bottom line is that gentle shampoos for oily hair tend to work well for me.<br /><br />I did not know when I got this that the gold bottles in the CLEAR SCALP line were for ethnic hair.  I discovered that this shampoo works well on ANY hair and acts as a softening agent. In fact, I think it would work well for just about anybody's hair.<br /><br />Enter this Godsend of a product.  I JUMPED at the chance to order this!  CLEAR SCALP is a very reasonably priced product and it was very gentle on my scalp and hair.  It made my hair feel nice and soft and it has a pleasant aroma.  I love the scent of coconut and almond and my nose loved this shampoo just as much as my scalp and hair did.  Your hair stays fresh and moist while you wash and rinse and will treat your head gently."
Claypso Lemonade Tastes fresh and refreshing,"I first tried this excellent lemonade in Sparks, Nevada and I have to admit it has to be one of the best bottled lemonades I have ever tried. It is very refreshing and has a fruity taste not normally found in bottled lemonades."
the cats all liked them!,"Looks like good ingredients in these, and amazingly all three cats liked them, a lot.  Glad to find a convenient raw treat, will be buying again.  We have only tried the chicken flavor."
These are the real deal!!!  Great Snack.,"After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but ""popped"",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!"
Virgin Coconut Oil,"Great to put on your skin, cook in and I even make sugar free chocolate with it by melting and putting cocoa and splenda in it, delicious!"
"I still like potato chips, but these are surprisingly delicious! Airy! Crispy!","These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of ""Dream Reachers"" series of books (with Chase Von)"
Amazing Tuna,I can eat this straight from the can.  It needs no other additives to make it delicious!!
My dog loved these!,"Very cute little biscuits shaped like bones, perfect for small treats and my dog absolutely loves them. The best part is that they are all natural :-)"
"Quality Product, Not Suited For My Taste Buds","I've been eating Annie's Mac n' Cheese (not the whole wheat type) since 1994.  Amazon offers a excellent price (around $1.50 per box for certified organic, whoa!) and if I'm going to commit upfront to 12 boxes of mac and cheese, I figured I try to be a little healthier and get the whole wheat type.<br /><br />It is a quality product but it isn't suited to my taste buds.  I am surprised because I prefer brown rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products.  But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy.  The watery white cheddar sauce enhanced the pasta's rougher texture and blandness.  (The white cheddar sauce is like an alfredo, and less creamy than Annie's regular cheddar.)  My friends love this stuff, but I think it's an acquired tasted.  If I had known what I know now, I'd have stuck with the enriched white (yet stripped of it's nutrients) shells or at least gone with the regular cheddar sauce.<br /><br />*Update*<br />While still not a full-on fan, I enjoying this product more now that:<br /><br />1.  Tastes much better when cooked 10-11 minutes at sea-level (the box recommends 8-10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle-y.<br /><br />2.  Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).  Other enjoyable variations were adding 2/3 cup of Italian parsley or 1/8 cup fresh dill leaves."
DELICIOUS!,"I've been hooked on Special K since I was in high school (I'm 25).  I've gone from the regular cereal, to Special K with Strawberries, and now I'm hooked on Protein Plus.  There is just something naturally sweet and tastey about this cereal- I eat it at least once per day.  And you can't beat the price!  I subscribed to it on Amazon, and get it delivered for $2.50 per box.  In the grocery store, when I can find it, it is $4.50+ per box.  Love it, and love Amazon!"
I love the almond bits!,About it tasting like it has sand in it...that is what I liked about it...the texture!  Absolutely delicious!  It wasnt like sand but like tiny almond chunks.  (hmm...interesting)  I have already told my friends about it!  YUM!
Perfect for my pets,"My dogs love these treats. They are the perfect size for a bone, not too large and easy to break in half. Can't find them at my local warehouse store so I came to Amazon to find them. Haven't tried the other flavors but these are a great organic and tasty (per Jack and Jill) treat for your furry family members."
Like homemade!,"These green beans from Glory Foods are the best I've found as far as canned green beans.  All others I've tried have been tasteless and bland.  Because I liked the green beans, I tried other Glory Foods items and so far I have found all their canned foods and even cornbread mixes delicious."
Amazing product! A+++++,"This is great food for dogs! My dogs usually weren't too enthusiastic about dry food, but they eat this stuff without any problems. I love that it is very healthy for them and grain-free with no undesirable ingredients. I supplement their food with salmon oil, so I'm happy to feed them this product, which has a reduced amount of fat. I also mix this dry food with other premium dry food or premium can food sometimes. I really enjoy providing my dogs with a variety of highly-palatable food that is good for them. One of my dogs had skin/allergy problems, and the healthy diet with reduced grains and increased omega oils has completely healed her skin and made her coat softer. This Wellness CORE Grain-free Dry Dog Food, Reduced Fat Recipe, is the one premium dry dog food that I mix with everything my dogs eat (with added salmon oil most of the time, although I did test them to see if they would eat it without the salmon oil, and they did). I highly recommend this wonderful product. A+++++"
Nice Variety,"This Crazy Cups Decaf Sampler (pack of 35) contained 13 different varieties of decaf coffee.  There were 3 k-cups of most varieties, 4 k-cups of one variety, and 1 or 2 k-cups of a few varieties. The k-cups arrived in great condition loose in one cardboard box. This was my first k-cup purchase for my brand new Keurig.  I thought it would be nice to try a variety of coffees to see which I liked best, but I think I will continue to purchase this sampler because I liked them all!"
Unexpected and delicious,I absolutely loved this cheese.  I pair it with fruits for a sweet and savory experience that is unbeatable.  The mustard seeds add the most delicious unexpected bite to this gem of a cheese.
A Good Value,"This is a good value, pound per pound, compared to the Folgers that I usually buy. It tastes smoother than Folgers, with none of the acid-y feeling and slight queasiness that I can get from drinking too much coffee. A milder blend with good taste would be my summary."
beware,13 dollars for 24 cups free shipping over 50 dollars is the going rate. These folks are pulling a swiftie
Did something change?,"The following is a review a just wrote for the 6 23.5oz bottles but applies here as well.<br /><br />""I have had this on subscription for at least the last 2 years. When my last subscription order was sent there was something very off on the flavor.<br />Each bottle had about a half inch of foam on top and had a very strong plastic or soapy taste. It's hard to describe but it was so bad I was unable to use it. I contacted Amazon and they were great, sent out a new order right away but when I received the shipment it was as bad as the first. When I contacted Amazon again they refunded my purchase price and actually made this product unavailable while they checked in to it. I see it is available again but I never found out what the issue was.<br />I figured it must have been a bad batch so I reordered and did get a new shipment last week, this time of the 2 44 oz bottles. It was just as bad. I contacted customer service and they were great and promptly refunded my money.<br />I ended up ordering another very popular, but more expensive, brand. This 'other' brand is much better. No problems at all. """
Great tasting,"Yummy, great tasting and very convenient.  Only drawback is you must clean your machine at least once a week to keep it from clogging, just like with hot chocolate."
Barry's Is Best,"When you don't have time to go overseas to get this, shop the 'net and have it delivered to your home. You will be glad you did to get the original Barry's."
Pretty tasty,I tried this mix a year or two ago and I thought it was pretty good! Certainly interesting. I liked the stabilized whipped cream. It was the first time I'd had it. Overall I thought it was a good mix as far as mixes go. It includes the filling and stabilizer for the whipped cream as well as the mix and chocolate sprinkle topping. Fun!
Great Snack,This product is a very good snack. Feel free to get this product. Taste great. Habit forming. You will order more.
Yummy Gummy,"These gummies are delicious. There are 6 different flavors in each bag and each flavor is distinct. Not only do they taste good, they also smell very good. The gummies are not hard like some other gummy candies that I've tried in the past. I purchased these for my family and they loved it. I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to other gummy candies."
Great!,"I found these shortly after I discovered my 3 kids have developed a sensitivity to wheat. Finding healthy gluten free snacks is tricky but finding gluten free snacks that the kids actually like is trickier. They love these plain right out of the bag or with dip or hummus. So do I! I can't find them anywhere near us so I am glad that Amazon has made them accessible. They are more flavorful than regular pretzels. With healthy seeds as ingredients, you won't be able to eat just one."
A Great unexpected Vacation to interesting coffees of the world,"What a Surprise when I opened my Amazon order! I guess I didnt realize just how much coffee there was in the order. I am enjoying all the different coffee's, especially since it is so easy to make W/ the pods. Not the best press of espresso, but still a nice variety, and EASY to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks for the Trip.<br /><br />Patrick Pala"
V8  SOUP,"Here is a secret recipe that you will not find in any fancy soup book, nor on the Food channel.  Add anything to V8 and you will find that you have a yummy soup.  Ham,  Chicken,  potatos,  Noodles, rice,  pack it in.  Great for that campfire caserole.  Make sure that its all cooked before hand.  Warm it up.  Yumm Yumm.<br /><br />No this does not compare to all those wonderful French, Polish, Jewish, Tai soups.  And my wife could cook circles around this V8 concotion.  But if you have leftovers, or its finals time at school.  This is now your secret soup.<br /><br />Study Hard!"
Senseo Espresso Coffee pods - Excellent,This is just wonderful.  I have a capuccino machine but I find that these pods are faster and taste as good as making it in my other machine.  I love my new Senseo machine also I have a steady supply of these pods delivered now.
Cat's love these things,"These are the only treats my wife's cats eats.  Give them anything else the dogs end up eating them.  Its funny because they like them so much they have learned to beg for them.  You can't lose with these treats, your cat will love them."
Great!,"I'm not much of a coffee drinker so when I found out that they make hot chocolate for Keurig, I couldn't wait to buy it, and it taste amazing.  I will definately buy more!"
Could be Better,"I give the Kong Incline Cat Scratcher two stars because our four kitties do like the incline and the scratching pad.  However, the overall unit is lightweight and flimsy.  The toy in the base intrigued them but unfortunately it's not a furry mouse as shown in the picture, but instead is (was) just a paper pom-pom.  Our smallest kitty had the toy in shreds by the end of the second day.  The base of the Kong scratcher is cardboard and the unit moves at the slightest touch, so you need to add extra weight in order to use it.  We bought the Bergan Turbo Cat Scratcher at the same time, and I'd recommend it over the Kong.  The Bergan model has a similar scratching mat and a heavy plastic base that stays in place.  And our kitties love pushing the ball around the track on the Bergan.  Overall, at around $12.00, the Bergan is more expensive but promises to last much longer.<br /><br />Update on 9/07/10:  Be aware that the refills that Amazon sells to accompany this Kong cat scratcher are too big for the base.  The only way to use them is to cut them down, which is a pretty messy process.  Meanwhile, our Bergan is still going strong.  (Their refills do fit their base.)"
Great Tasting Potato CHIPS.,The potato chips are wonderfully tasty.  My sons and I both like the Rosemary and Olive Oil because it is not as spicy.  We also got the Jalapeno.  It is not so much I don't like the Jalapeno.  It is spicy hot for me.  I still love the potato chips.
Best tasting/effective,"After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."
"Moldy sauce, no replacement offered","I purchased the Gia Russa Alla Vodka, and when I opened it I found moldy and rotten tomato chunks in the sauce and had to throw the entire jar away. I emailed the company and asked for a refund. A couple weeks later I received a $1 off coupon in the mail. I sent a second email again requesting a refund, and never received a reply. This product is very expensive compared to other pasta sauces and as a result I expected the manufacturer to have a high level of quality control and customer service. It appears they have neither. Moldy/rotten product plus very bad customer service to not send a refund. I will never purchase this product again."
Yummy & great price!,"This is a great, yummy product.  My whole family likes to snack on these and you cannot beat the Amazon price."
Its so hot!!!,"If you want something really spicy on your food...then look no further! This stuff is hot, especially the first time you try, i have pranked many people into trying it, i tell them nahhh its not hot its like tapatio hot sauce but it taste better and so they pour it all over their food and after 2 bites they give up, i have made wings with this and gave some to my cousins and they went into their fridge to drink a whole gallon of milk! The taste is very good. I bought 2 bottles but after that i found that they sell this product for  6.99 at world market so i save myself money buying it there."
Breathalicious,"My dogs LOVE these,  and they are so much easier on their GI track than greenies."
Nasty stuff,"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money."
"Superb flavor, excellent value, nice box!","I'm not really a fan of fruity flavored coffees like raspberry chocolate frappa-mocha-cina or french vanilla twist or what-have-you, but occasionally I do like a hint of hazelnut in my cup of joe, and Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups handily fill the bill.  The hazelnut taste is fairly subtle, blending well with the rich flavor of the coffee.  I've tested brewing on all 3 settings on our Keurig, and prefer the medium and large cup settings in terms of coffee strength.<br /><br />Buying these on Amazon ends up cheaper than pretty much anywhere else (yes, even cheaper than Bed, Bath and Beyond with the coupons) and the frustration free packaging is great.  Open up the box with your bare hands (no wasteful shrink wrap to throw away or hard plastic that needs to be cut with a knife), and fold the box up for recycling when you're finished.<br /><br />This is my second time ordering this set from Amazon and it won't be my last.  And writing about it reminded me how good it is so I've just gone and made myself another cup!"
My child adores these melts,My son is obsessed with these melts.  He will literally drop whatever he's doing at any given time if I present these to him.  I tried them and I don't like them but every child I've met loves them.
great product,I used nicorette to quit smoking and I used gum to quit nicorette...regular gum has a bunch of things I can't pronounce in the name that gave me headaches (because I chew a lot) so I had to go to a natural gum with no sugar (sugar is bad) :)....this gum is great and all natural...not sure if Xylitol really does help your teeth or not...but as a far as natural sugar free gum goes this does trick...highly recommended....
Great coffee but way cheaper if you buy from your local starbucks,5 stars for the coffee (I like the fact that it's much less acidic on your stomach than French & Italian Roast) + its slight mocha taste<br />minus 1 star for the fact that it would be ~$40 for 3-16 oz bags from your local Starbucks.
lots of uses for this green tea...,"lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened."
Delicious Herbal Tea!,Love this herbal tea! It's so delicious! It tastes just like Oolong Tea from the chinese restaurant minus the unhealthy tannins found in actual tea!
Busy Buddy Tug a Jug,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ"">Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug, Medium/Large</a><br />I am as occupied watching as my dogs are playing with this. We have 3 dogs, Gracie(13+boxer), Annie (2.5 mix) Jo(2 boxer) I bought 2. I thought I should have gotten the smaller one but, Jo loves it. Gracie is getting into it too. Annie just waits for the treats to come out when the other 2 play with it. All 3 dogs are 55-60 lbs.  It's great if your dog takes to it. Hit or miss on that one. If they do it's a great occupier of time. I have been filling it with their regular super premium dog food and a little bit of Beneful dog food kibbles & bits for variety. So no expensive treats. Jo has been gnawing on the end ball and it shows no sign of wear. Not even teeth marks. Best $$ spent on any toy, ever."
Please avoid!!,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo."
Wonderful soft mango,This product is excellent. I love it. It is soft and chewy not tough. My only problem is that when you get to the end it is only crumbs.
MY DOGS LOVE THESE LIKE CRACK COCAINE!  LOL..,my dogs absolutely love these things and go crazy! They leave the sweet potatoes and just eat the duck meat.
Fruit Slices,"This product is TERRIFIC!  The slices are fresh, flavorful, and tasty.  This is my favorite snack.  And, I don't have to eat a lot to satisfy my sweet tooth."
The Best Substitute,"I have tried all sugar substitutes and used Splenda for several years.  I had to give up Splenda due to a side<br />effect and someone recommended Xylitol.  This product is great, I use it in everything.  It tastes good, is a<br />natural sweetner, and has no bad after taste or side effect.  I don't really bake, so I cannot attest to its use<br />in baking but it is the best in everything else."
Bread! I missed you!,"I have no problem with the texture of this bread as I've been eating Ezekiel bread for a while now, which also has a firmer chewier texture than white bread. After going keto and needing my carb intake to be even lower, I thought this might be too good to be true when I saw it on Amazon. Hallelujah! Totally lives up to expectations. I can have grilled cheese again! BLT! breakfast sandwiches, pate with toast points, PB and (sugar-free) J, the possibilities... this bread has made me very happy :)"
my cats are happy,"Good price, free & fast shipping... the product itself is the same as at retail stores. My cats prefer this (the Prime Filets) to the pate (one of them won't touch the pate at all)."
YUMMY,A friend introduced me to biscotti several years ago.  I never thought it was something I would like.  It looked like dried melba toast.<br />Guess what!  It's the best stuff.  So good with a cup of coffee.  And Nonni's is the best.
quality lightly sweetened green tea powder,"lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened."
Terrible....possibly the worst ever,"I tried this flavor 2 years ago right after I bought my first Keurig machine.  It had a good smell but the taste was completely awful.  It was so heavy on the cloves that it obliterated everything else.  The pumpkin flavor was barely discernable as was any other spice...where are the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors?  There was nothing I could do to make this kcup palatable.  I tried flavored creamers, syrups, whipped cream, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I mixed it with other kcups (french vanilla, caramel drizzle, obsidian, french and italian roasts).  The result was it ruined my favorite flavors/brews! I had to toss the last few kcups and the box (after a year of it sitting on my shelf and taunting me).  I would not let anyone else drink this vile swill.  I found one recently hiding in my storage draw that I no longer use for kcups.  I resisted the urge to beat it with a baseball bat and just tossed it in the garbage.  Top 3 worst ever:  Pumpkin spice, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya (another spice problem), and Folger's Vanilla Biscotti (incredibly artificial).  Honorable mention goes to Caribou Mahogany.  Trust me on this...NEVER try a coffee that describes it's taste as leather and tobacco. Sometimes, there actually IS truth in advertising! If you want good pumpkin coffee, run out and buy the Dunkin Donuts kcup.  It's everything the green mountain pumpkin spice should have been....smooth, balanced, a hint of spice and you can actually taste the pumpkin."
Even the best formula is still imitation,"It's good that there is an organic infant formula available.<br />Keep in mind that ALL formula is imitation human milk. The very best is human milk, so if breastfeeding is not contraindicated for a unique situation, that's the very BEST!"
"Excellent, versatile mix","I've used this mix for many years to bake a variety of muffins, cupcakes, cookies and cakes.  It's hard to find gluten-free mixes that don't bake up too crumbly or hard.  Baked goods from this mix can easily pass for other baked goods made with wheat.  Being able to buy this through Amazon now is a real plus, especially with the ability to have it automatically re-ordered and shipped on a schedule I choose."
Great Novelty Item,I try to get this every year for my husband for Christmas.  He absolutely loves the giant Reeses cups - just as good as the regular sized one but blown up!  Highly recommended if you can get them at a decent price (under $15)
Wonderful Product - Lots of Energy,"This is a great product, great value.  I take bottles per day, it gives me a nice boost of energy,  like to take it first thing in the morning and at 3PM or after lunch.  Great taste."
San Francisco Rainforest blend,"I had no problems with their unusual cups working in the Kuerig.  The coffee was good, nothing remarkable but enjoyable.  I do plan to try some of the other San Francisco blends.  It's certainly worth a try."
Not so good & close to expiry,"These might be OK for hi-protein pretzels but they are not so good as pretzels, period. In addition, the bags I received will expire in less than 3 months. I am not pleased."
My pug loves this!,"Pugs are NOT finicky eaters - still mine gobbles this up and loves it as much as any food I've tried on him. He weighed 18 lbs. when I first started him on this and reminded me of a fat little sausage. He has almost finished one 26 lb. bag and has lost 3 lbs. and is holding at a steady 15 lbs. now. I feed him 1/4 c. in the morning and 1/3 c. in the evening. And....2 - 3 times a week I give him a ""treat"". The food does what is supposed to. Vet says he couldn't be healthier!"
Hearty but rancid?,"I was excited to try this cereal, and when I eat granola, I like putting them on top of plain (perhaps just slightly sugared) oatmeal cereals. Hot.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I was surprised that it smelled a bit rancid... I wasn't sure whether or not that is how it's supposed to smell. However, the taste is great. It is very nutty, and very chewy/crunchy. It also doesn't become soggy quickly, even though I put it into hot oatmeal.<br /><br />My one slight complain would be that the bag does not seem to seal very well. It has the built-in seal, but it doesn't seal tightly - some light movements would open it. It also doesn't stand on its bottom, but that's probably not a huge deal.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this granola. It's very tasty."
""" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""","I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer."
My dog likes these soft treats better than the traditional Zuke's treats,I've been using Zuke's training treats for years. (I alternate between various treats and mix them up.) My dog loves these more than any others. Even without my trick of crushing freeze dried liver into powder and mixing it in he loves these treats.
Tastes Great,"I can't really speak to the Detox effectiveness but this is the first herbal tea I've ever really liked the taste of.  I make one cup of tea, add a little packet of stevia then put it in a 32 oz jug of water and chill.  Even diluted that much it still has a nice flavor to me.  I love my Starbucks Iced Venti Soy Chai Tea but my waistline doesn't.  So between this and General Foods International Chai Latte (Sugar-Free) I'm staying clear of Starbucks."
A Good Medium Blend Morning Cup Of Coffee,Folgers Brazilian Blend Ground Coffee is a medium blend coffee that is one of my favorite coffee's for my morning wakeup. We have the Kuerig K-Cup coffee brewer and bought a couple of Solofill Refillable Single Serve Filter Cups for Kuerig Brewers from amazon so as to be able to use ground coffee from different manufacturers at a much cheaper price per serving. I like my coffee black and I find this coffee has a good taste which does not leave a bitter or an acid after-taste in your mouth. The coffee also has a pleasing aroma. I find that this 27.8 ounce tub will last two months with using between one and two cups of coffee a day.
Too salty,These beef sticks are the most salty ones I've ever tried.  I can stand salty but I can barely finish 1 stick due to it's heavy salty taste.
"Sweet Oil, Rich, the best","Thick, rich smell and great quality. This oil is the really great stuff. This oil remains on the skin even after shower. It also arouse and excite your senses.  Great oil. This makes a great gift for a guy/husband."
"Good, but could last longer.","I'm a gum fanatic, but usually I'm used to the sugary versions, or else the very minty alternatives.  I'm trying Spry for the first time, and I think it's a fantastic gum, but I feel the flavor runs out very quickly, and it also comes in very small portions.  The packaging is also frustrating, because I'm used to pushing into the tab for the gum to come out, but the packet that actually holds the gum is small compared to the sleeve, so you have to shake it out."
I love these candies!,"These candies are my favorite! I am so glad I found them and can buy them in bulk, although they didn't last very long in my house! I am looking forward to my next shipment."
Organic and Tasty!,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the pouches open easily. They don't reseal, but that's fine because there are never leftovers."
Love it!,We order this product all the time for the office.  We put a splash of Hazelnut creamer and it is AMAZING!
one of the Best !,Sahale makes several nut mixes but the Valdosta blend is one of the Best.<br /><br />Just enough pepper and sweet to satisfy with a small handful.<br /><br />We always keep it on hand.
"Really like the taste, but where's the fizz?","This stevia sweetened, natural soda has a really great crisp, clean flavor and is very refreshing because it's not too sweet.  But it loses fizz way too quickly.  If you leave it in the opened can longer than about an hour, it goes competely flat.  It also loses fizz quickly when poured warm over ice.  Please fix the fizz issue, Blue Sky, and we'll buy more."
"Shiny, Soft, Scented Hair","I reviewed the Shampoo in this line, so I thought I might as well say something about the Conditioner.<br /><br />This conditioner is thick, like the kind you get when you buy the boxed hair dye (which I really love) I have tried it ALL, Garnier (the entire line), Pantene, Sauve...and finally this came to the market, so I thought, ""Why not?"" FINALLY! I really like this stuff.  I bought the little tester bottles and now I have an inexpensive product that moisturizes well, gives shine and smells amazing (the scent lasts into the next day).  I just hope they don't change the formula!"
Deliciously  Healthy,"PURE NATURAL CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS are the answer to those dieting, or those choosing health conscious treats. I didn't expect them to be so delicious; usually bars of this type taste more like cardboard.  Not, PURE NATURAL CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS.  They are moist, crunchy with almonds and dates, sweetened with agave nectar and rich with dark cocoa.  I love them.  With only 180 calories per generous bar, they are perfect for those dieting or searching for only nutritious snacks for children and adults.  I will buy more to settle that chocolate beast who arises in me hunkering for a candy bar that adds unwanted pounds.<br /><br />PURE NATURAL CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS impressed me and being the chocolate connoisseur that I am that is saying a mouthful!!!!"
"good as meal replacement, not weight loss","My title about sums it up.<br /><br />PROS: Taste better than most protein shakes and keeps you full for 2-3 hours<br /><br />CONS: Less protein, more sugar than other shakes... which doesn't help if you are drinking for weight loss."
The Closest Thing to The Real Movie Theatre Popcorn,"I love movie theatre popcorn and if you read posts on how it's made, the secret is using coconut oil and flavoring salt. What you have here is all the contents needed in one simple package.  I have tried other brands that have the same three key ingredients, but this brand is BY FAR, the closest thing to movie theatre popcorn as you'll get. This is it!!! If you want the same taste as the theatres, look no further.  Great Northern is the brand!!!!"
Best I've Found,"I have found it hard to find the kind of ""gift"" of spices I had wanted to give.  This one is the best one I have found.  It provides a large selection of different types of spices.  Although it does not detract in a major way, I would have preferred a little more permanent packaging of the different spices."
Breakfast Blend Coffee,We normally buy Folgers or Maxwell House coffee but we have found Green Mountain comes the closest in k-cup form and we waste much less coffee now.
Not bad. Sorta watery.  Quite sweet.,"It's not bad.  I had this on my way into work.  Great way to get some caffiene in ya before work!  It only has 4 ingredients: Coffee, sugar, and the other two I assume are preservatives or something.  It tasted almost creamy, although there is no cream in it!  It was sweeter - more sweet than anything else.  The coffee flavor is on the watery side.  It tasted like one of those cold Starbucks drinks you can buy, only not as creamy.  I thought it was good enough - but I'd never buy them.  My preference for a cold coffee-style drink is those excellent Starbucks bottle things!!!"
Great flavor - and a bargain to boot!,"I discovered Torani syrups at Walmart of all places. I'm very pleased with the smooth vanilla taste of this syrup. By purchasing through Amazon and signing up for the automatic delivery, I got twice as much for the same price. Win! I've only used it in coffee so far but as a coffee lover, I do enjoy adding my own flavor to really good coffee and saving the cost of buying flavored coffee. I also drink my coffee black, so this is perfect for those of us who don't use cream. Just wish they sold it with no sweetener at all. I've tried straight vanilla extract and it doesn't impart the same rich vanilla taste - it leaves a sort of chemical aftertaste. I only wish Amazon sold the original Hazelnut flavor, not the new formula. Torani, please make the Classic Hazelnut available through Amazon as well! I'll be a repeat buyer of that flavor too!"
My dogs really liked them,"My dogs started eating these the minute I gave them to them, and they seemed to last a little longer than other biscuits I've bought for them.  I can't say if these biscuits really will cut down on the amount of tarter on their teeth just yet, but I'm sure time will tell.  For now I see no harm in giving them the 2 two biscuits each day that the box recommends, and hopefully it will help cut down on the tarter.  That they really liked them was an added bonus."
Just the right ratio of sesame seeds to salt,Most sesame salts are mainly salt. This kind's primarily sesame seeds and they have a great texture and flavor.<br />It's also a great buy.
Strong Brown sugar and molasses flavor.. Good quality,These are very high quality.. The taste is not for me because they have a strong brown sugar and molasses flavor.. The ones I had from austinuts were more cinnamon flavor which I like better. But if you like brown sugar and molasses and would like a very high quality product I would recommend these.. 3 stars solely for personal taste preference
"Fresh Breath, No after taste","i have these on repeat order and the reason i do is because i love them.<br /><br />they are an extremely potent small mint.  they remind me of the ones starbucks used to sell which i would swear by.  they're peppermint and keep my mouth feeling clean and fresh.  there isnt the aftertaste as with say altoids or what not.<br /><br />the package is a small metal tin which fits in your pocket easily. dimensions are 2W x 1.5L x .5D.  inside the tin the mints are wrapped in a plastic bag to ""preserve and protect the high quality"".<br /><br />oh and they're sugar free.  love these things."
Love them!,"I have bought Happybaby products in the past and love them all!! I was so bummed when their other pouches went off the market! So glad they are back! I love that they have some with veggies in with the fruit, they are the only kind i buy. I have them everywhere!! My son loves them and so do I! They are great for vacation when you can't control meals quite as much as home i know he is still getting some better foods in his diet. My son is now 2 and i don't see an end to him enjoying these! I would like some more flavors with veggies in them!"
"Too sweet, almond extract flavor too strong","I had high hopes for the product, but it's too sweet for me and the almond extract flavor is overpowering. I couldn't taste a real almond flavor. I'm willing to try another flavor though."
my son loves these,Son really likes these. He eats them for snack all the time. However now that he is 1 he doesnt like them as much
Fenugreek tea,"The taste is not great, but it's bearable. I could not get used to the smell, the unfinished box is still sitting in my drawer and I've no plans to stock up in future."
English Toffee Stevia,This is by far my favorite flavor of liquid Stevia.I always have a back-up on hand so I never run out.
Bio-Bag,"Great product and seller.  Wasn't aware the bio-bags can be used like the over-priced ""Green"" bags.  More economy in an expensive world."
Great!,"The Pure Himalayan Salt is very good.  I typically do not use salt, but this salt has a very good taste that is so different than regular table salt.  I highly recommend this product!"
No peanut butter taste!,"This peanut butter cookie was very disappointing. It looked great and was crunchy but it had no peanut butter taste at all. It's flavor was a bit ""off"" - sort of like a rice cracker.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FNH1C2"">Nana's Cookie, Peanut Butter, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />My favorite peanut butter cookie continues to be Grandma's which I have ordered three times."
Great,I was excited to see these on Amazon. My kids love these fruit ropes & I have a hard time finding them in the store.
My dog loves it,"Unlike the other reviewer's dog, mine loves ""Newman's Own"" canned food.  I gotta believe that if a dog won't touch this, the dog is not only extremely fussy, but not very hungry as well.  Having this delivered to my door cheaper than I can buy it at my local supermarket sure is handy."
Roland Giant Snails - Most Excellent,"Based on reviews, we ordered a case.  These are awesome, just as indicated by others.  Delicious when heated with garlic/shallot butter; very tender and GIANT.  Very minor issues: (1) There were 16 in the can we opened.  Since I assume sold/packed by weight and not number, would have been even larger if only 12. (2) strong sulfur smell when opening the can, but easily rinsed off and not apparent in heated snails. (3) I had assumed, apparently incorrectly, country of origin was France.  Packaging (but not web site) indicates from Indonesia; I hope better than food coming from China!  We will order again."
Very Good Taste but TOO MUCH SALT,I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt.
"Strange name, but I enjoy Ashwagandha matcha every day","A very nice tea. Strange name, great benefits. Must like Matcha tea in general to enjoy this one. Recommended for everyday use."
"Tried it in many uses, but didn't like it","I bought this olive oil since it was organic, and went through 6 (750 mL) cans on a subscription, but in the end I decided to stop buying it. I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket."
I can't believe it has zero calorie,"I was never a big fan of coffee. Loved the energy boost but couldn't put up with its bitter taste. So I would always put tons of sugar in mine to make it drinkable. And all those calories in just one beverage... Not worth it. Until Torani came up with this delicious sugar-free, zero-calorie syrup. Now I drink coffee every morning and I love it. I started with their six flavors assortment and they are all okay but caramel is my favorite and the only one I buy regularly. Also, love that Amazon sells those pack for a decent price."
really....,"I received this product the other day, and when I opened the box it came in I literally laughed out loud. These things are TINY!!! I almost instantly regretted spending over 10 dollars for a mere 24 servings when you can buy a box with 20 servings for less than 5 bucks and the grocery store. But I kept them to try them anyway.<br /><br />Pro's: 1. there's a little bag inside of the little box, which I find useful since I hate trying to pour all of those little flakes out of that little whole. So I can take the bag out, cut a bigger hole and they pour a lot better.<br /><br />Con's: 1. Preseasoned. I don't like pepper in my mashed potatoes... or at least not that much.<br />2. Obviously, it's a small box, and for me many con's come along with that.<br />3. It's very expensive!!!<br /><br />And as for being organic.... All that's in Hungry Jack's Potato Flakes is... POTATOES...!!! That's good enough for me, I don't want added salt, added pepper, etc. Also, I had a professor who once said ""Coal is organic, would you eat that too?"". The term ""Organic"" has become a major selling strategy over the past few years, and frankly I wouldn't buy much into this one. I mean... they're good... just not ""buy again"" good. Or at least not for me."
Tastes just like my favorite Starbuck's Bottled Frappuccino,"I really like the Starbucks drink, but hate carrying a glass bottle in my pack. These are a handy alternative. They taste almost identical to the coffee flavored Frappuccino drink, but in a handy can.  Definitely like this. The combination of taste and portability are a big plus. It can't be resealed (unlike the Starbucks glass bottle), but I finish them off pretty quick anyway."
I won't be buying it,"I received a complimentary bottle through Amazon's vine program to review. We have big boys2men in the family, whose team-mates are around a lot of the time. We make a lot of tacos in our family. We make our own taco sauce so our tastes may be biased to anything in a bottle, but I was willing to try it as the guys like the ""crema"" on their tacos sometimes too (that's a Mexican product).<br /><br />We all like spicy and this says BOLD but believe us, it is not.  We couldn't seem to get a real flavor out of it. Even tried it as a dip on a chip but then they really didn't like it. Perhaps on a burger as one reviewer described would be best, in place of say the ""secret sauce"" some people like on their burgers. I tried it on my salad, but didn't care for it that way either :(<br /><br />Sorry, we couldn't give it a better review but it won't make our grocery list."
"Great Product, If Amazon Sends You Fresh Ones","Gave only 4 starts because recently Amazon sent me a batch that was tough and hard to chew into. But the product itself is great if shipped fresh. The fresh ones last for a couple of months.  But if you get a hard batch, recommend getting replacements because they are really hard to bite into and sometimes I feel like my teeth may fall out trying to rip into the hard pieces."
Premium Price - SoSo results,"Ordered the Acana Ranchlands because of the reviews that I saw on various websites.  The dog (Miniature Poodle) liked it so-so, and then the worst part was his stool became really, really (!!) HARD on this food.  Tried other Acana varities (e.g., Grasslands) - and had the same result.  He was nearly constipated on the Acana and had a very tough time trying to pass a stool.  Then the stool itself had a very hard consistency - not at all normal.<br /><br />So, for the money, I would say pass this up and go for something else!!  We've switched to Taste of the Wild (which is also grain free) and are finding that the dog loves it as much - if not more - and aren't having any of the stool issues that we did with Acana."
OMG!,"Soo I've been stalking this product on Amazon but I'd seen mixed reviews. So, I wanted to see if I could find a box in a local store to try it out before buying a 12 pack.  I tried it today, and WOW! I love it! I think this will help my fiance jump on the organic foods bandwagon with me ;) Also it's great for those days I get home from work at midnight and want some comfort food!"
Crunch. Wow!,"Not too salty like regular supermarket chips, this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt! When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.<br /><br />There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.<br /><br />This is an excellent product!"
yummy...i love this stuff!,"these licorice hard candies are exactly as you see in the picture, and taste even better.  i've eaten panda black chewy ""natural"" licorice, but it's not sweet enough when i want to eat some (real) CANDY.  this claey's licorice tastes just as my taste buds imagined/hoped they would.  i'm sold, and about to place my second order of them.  each piece is approximately 1/2"" by 1/2"", the perfect size, the perfect taste, the perfect candy for my sweet craving.  some might think they are a little pricey, but we need to indulgence ourselves on occasion...we deserve it, right?  my new favorite candy!"
Too sweet....,"The taste is pretty ok but it is too sweet for me. If you do not like sweet bar, skip this."
good stuff,"i have tried several different energy drinks,and NO FEAR is by far my favorite! i have never been a coffee drinker, NO FEAR IS my morning coffee! AMAZON is THE PLACE!!!"
Green Mountain Nantucket coffee,I love the Green Mountain Nantucket coffee. It is every thing I hoped it would be.The taste and aroma is awesome. I certainly will purchase it again and again. Try it. You just might love it as I do. I get my coffee through Amazon and it is so easy and delivery is quick.  Pamela Hebert
The nuts have it!,"This is a very smooth coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor and a hint of almonds.  The flavors are not strong and the almond flavor is subtle.  Overall, a very good coffee for those who do not like strong flavors.  I would definitely buy this one again."
don't buy this stuff,"I have used this dog food for years.  About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price.  I continued to buy it.  No one told me there was any change in formula.  My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.  If your dog is the least bit sensitive, it will create toxic effects for your dog. It is poisonious to those dogs with allergies."
TASTES GREAT,"I ordered these to use for marathon training. I have a sensitive stomach,but have had no problems with these. They do give me energy during those long runs!"
Coffee People Jet Fuel K-cups,"The coffee is better than others we have triedin K-cups. It available through the club, meaning, iots price is good.  And the delivery is always on time."
Munchy and Satisfying,"A friend a work brought these in to share and I just loved them.  I probably wouldn't eat 30 of them at once, but measure them into snack baggies. They are crunchy and taste like potatoe chips to me.  It is a real taste treat.  I am having a hard time finding them in our local stores, so I may end up ordering them online.  I love the Special K Protein Plus cereal too, but that is difficult to find at times too."
Such an excellent chip,"My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted. There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips. I love the zip, agreed they are awesome without salsa, and no trans fat!"
My dog loves these!,"I was skeptical of these at first because my Silky Terrier typically likes chews at first, but will play with them for maybe the first 30 minutes, and then leave them around the house.  These chews are ones that my dog consistently goes back too."
Yummy,"Pocky is an incredibly good snack, but more than that, I was impressed with Very Asia's packaging. I had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer. On top of that the package of dessert pocky I ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo. T_T So of course I was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away, but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading ""PROTECT FROM HEAT"" and my pocky arriving in perfect condition! (Well, they did stick together just a bit). I love Very Asia more than anything now."
Excellent Snack Food,These things are great. Perfect size bag for an afternoon snack. If you like salt and vinegar flavor you will like these.
SWEET!,This is a great candy. Some of the best gummy bears I've ever tasted! I can't stop buying them.
"Good quality, affordable food.","It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)"
Not really a gift pack.,"I purchased this ""gift pack"" for my cousin as a Christmas gift. He loves hot sauces and I thought this would be the perfect ""usable"" gift. While he was very happy with the sauces (before even tasting them), I was disappointed at the fact that this item was listed as a ""gift pack."" When I think of a ""gift pack"" I think of something that is nicely boxed or packaged. What I received was a shipping box with 6 bottles of hot sauce, each individually wrapped in packing paper to avoid damage during shipping. They're fine - don't get me wrong - but not very presentable as a ""gift."""
Rebar,Love these organic Rebar when I can't have all my daily fruits and veggies. The order was accurate and delivered fast.
nothing special,"Wolfgang Puck's ""Breakfast in Bed"" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one."
Buyer beware,"I ordered this item, and was instead shipped a different item (ginger beer).  There is a difference, and the company that makes this makes both.  However, Amazon's warehouses are too stupid to recognize the difference.  When I politely pointed out to them that they had shipped me the wrong item, they very politely apologized, and promised to send me the right item...whereupon they sent me exactly the same wrong item again.  When I complained again, and asked them to either find the right item, or refund my money, they ignored me.  If you really want ginger ale, you can buy this mix on the Internet from other suppliers.  Don't say I didn't warn you."
"Very tasty, wonderfully convenient","Great for on-the-go.  Tastes way better than the Slim Fast...no metalic can taste.  Not quite a meal replacement.  I usually need something with it, like a piece of fruit or a small salad.  Wish they could make it with less carbs, then it would get 5 stars from me.  Think of it as a quick and easy shake without having to fuss with a blender.  I keep some in the fridge at work, too. Definitely drink it cold.  Amazon has the best prices around and with the Subscribe and Save, it couldn't be easier!"
Great Coffee,Although the price is higher than what I normally would pay for coffee I feel it is well worth it. Very bold taste. Now everytime I drink any other coffee I feel as though it has no flavor compared to this coffee
Tasty,These are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty.  I didn't find them overly salty as some commented.  They are very good and I would buy them again and again if the price were lower.  I got them as a special (24 single serve bags for $14) and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks.  Each bag is 100 cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips.  Yummy.
Surprisingly pleasant flavor!,We took a chance and ordered this raspberry flavored coffee without ever trying it first and are so glad we did!  It has a surprisingly pleasant aroma and flavor!  We've never experienced a bad Timothy's flavored Kcup!
Stick To Easy Mac,"I bought this to have something quick to eat at work on my lunch break.  The noodles have an odd texture, kinda rubbery.  The ""cheese sauce"" is runny and tasteless.  And honestly the stuff has an odd smell to it.  I think a can of Alpo would have been more satisfying. The chef makes tasty ravioli but he needs to stay far far away from mac and cheese.  If you are looking for a on the go mac and cheese lunch, Kraft Easy Mac for the win."
I love them,These are very good pop tarts.  My dad loves them too because he loves duplex cookies and he ate all of his very quickly.
Ridiculously delicious!,"Perfect oats and dark chocolate combination, and healthy too!! I use these for energy on my runs and/or gym workouts."
Delicious,"Boy , this was good. The aroma when you first open the package leaves one with great anticipation that you will soon be enjoying a great cup of java. Too often times , the result does not meet the expectations. Not so with the Melitta Cafe Collection ! The coffee was amongst the best I have ever tasted. Treat yourself to a fantastic splurge !"
It works and taste good,"I am a sugar junky but I can actually drink this tea without sugar.  Unfortunately, I ran out of it a little soon (I was using it as a home remedy) but it worked while it lasted..."
Grew up on these,"I'm Israely and these were always a staple in our home.  I am now a mom and have passed the tradition on to my children and they love them as well.  Today, I still eat them and love them!"
good cookie,I really like this cookie. A bit dry but good the same. My granddaughter says yummy.
People Either Love or Hate Valerian!,"I love Valerian and I love it's earthy smell! But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!"
Best K-Cup Coffee,"I am a ""black"" coffee drinker and prefer a bold brew.  My wife likes hers ""doctored"" with sweetener and flavored creamer.  She likes a lighter brew.  The Emeril's works for both of us!"
A Great Treat to Use in All Occassions!,"I bought this as a training treat for my little puppy and his siblings (whom I'm fostering) and they all love it! So for the amount of treats that you get in the bag and for the price, it's a great buy!"
Great coffee!,"My wife and I bought the Keurig and started experimenting with coffees.  Most were too strong, but this Breakfast Blend hit it right on the head.  Of course it's a matter of personal taste, but if you don't like your coffee as strong as Starbucks typically is, this is a great coffee.  Love that Keurig!"
Organic goodness for the furry ones,"I have been feeding my cats Newman's Own Organics Organic Beef and Liver for years now and their health is the better for it.  Whenever I go to the vet and mention that I'm feeding them this they have nothing but good things to say.  The kitties love it and their hairless ape of a dad loves it to... loves to watch them love it, I don't eat it myself... not yet."
Good,"My baby like this very much.I think the salmon is delicious,the salmon is good food,it can make my baby happy."
great-tasting coffee!,"This is one of my favorite K-cup varieties, along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006586QXG"">Starbucks French Roast</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XE0LWQ"">Barista Prima ""Italian"" Dark Roast</a>. The price of this coffee is usually quite a bit cheaper than the other two, but the quality of it is very comparable. If you're a fan of dark, bold roasts, you will like this one. I have always liked coffee from Starbucks, and anyone that has had their coffee knows that they brew their coffee really strong. Hence, that is why I like the dark, bold roasts for my Keurig. Even though I use creamer and sweetener, I really like the taste of coffee to be prominent. The lighter roasts just don't do it for me. This is a great-tasting bold roast!"
Good Product.  Extremely effective!,"I don't use this tea for dieting but more so for a natural cleanse to keep the body free of harmful toxins.  It is very effective have used it for years!  First time users may experiece cramping but, after awhile they cease.  Great Effective Product!"
AMAZING STUFF!,Gotta love the peanut butter with out all the calories and fat! Its perfect for use as peanut butter alone or in a healthy protein shake!
Decent healthy chili,This is a good alternative for a healthy low cholesterol diet.  I usually add some hot sauce and it satisfies my chili cravings.
clear vanilla,"The product is OK, but I was looking for one that wasn't artificial.  I'm not sure there is a clear vanilla that is not artificial.  Thank You."
She must be a picky eater.,"My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats..."
My dog loves these!,My little 5 pound Maltese loves these! I mix half or one third of one tray with his dry food and he just gobbles it up! These are way more expensive in any store.
Anti-bonking!,"These are great.  They taste good.  Buying the quantity of course comes with the discount.  I think the expiration on them is like a year out.  They are great for energy when out there for an extended period of time.  Of course, I only use them like I use Gatorade, only if I am exercising (biking, running, etc) for 2+ hours.  I like them because it gives me the energy to keep going, but instead of eating something that sits in my stomach and weighs me down, these don't do this, niceeeee.  They are well worth it to me.  With these and Cliff Bars, I can just keep goin."
Old favorite,I love this brand of pasta. I'm from Philly and grew up on this. There is nothing like it. I'm so happy I found it.
good combination of (nonherbal) Tea and other flavors,"This ""Vanilla Spice"" energy tea is based on a combination of Green and Black Tea with a variety of organic root and leaf flavors to round it out. Both my husband and I like the taste of this tea. The vanilla flavor is mild and I also taste the Rooibos, and some hints of the other flavors. I normally don't care for plain rooibus tea, but it works well in this combination. The tea is slightly sweet, probably because of the addition of Stevia Leaf and the Licorice Root. I am not a coffee or energy drink consumer, so the 80 mg of caffeine is rather much for me, but I did not feel jittery, and I also did feel a bit of a lift. I think any caffiene (most of which is ""naturally occurring"" anyway) could make you feel jittery, though. The Yogi people have also added a ""naturally occurring amino acid found in green tea, [which, (they say)] promotes relaxation by calming the mind.""<br /><br />I am definitely going to drink some more of this tea in the a.m.s and check out how it makes me feel."
Easy,It is by far the easiest way to measure the right amount. I love the different flavors that are available.
Rip Off,Deceptive ad.  You can buy from Green Mountain for $13.95 a box of 24.  Don't buy from these crooks.
Different and tasty!,"When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you."
Primary Flavor is Sugar,"I don't want to say these are awful but I won't ever get them again. The praise in other reviews, especially for the hickory strips, convinced me to try them. I now suspect the praise was ""planted"" by vested interests.<br /><br />The weaknesses of the product are legion. First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee."
We Love Sunbutter,"We love Sunbutter! I don't have to worry about using it, as it and the company is completely PEANUT FREE!. Sunbutter taste great, unlike Soy Butter which is gritty and awful tasting. I use Sunbutter for anything that I would use peanut butter for cookies, frostings and candies, dips, etc. Sunbutter has the same consistency and texture as peanut butter and doesn't need refrigeration. When using Sunbutter for baking you do have to cut back to about 1/2 of the baking soda and/or baking powder or you can add a little bit of lemon juice to prevent your baked goods from turning green from the sunflower seeds. If your cookies do turn green it doesn't affect the taste just the looks (guess how I know that little bit of information :). Sunbutter also has a great website at sunbutter dot com with recipes and information about their products. Check out their site and defiantly get some Sunbutter."
loving the new dog food,"I used to buy one of those Purina brands for both my dogs which was fine at first. Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug, you know how stinky their farts could get! After eating this one for a while, my pug seems to have less flatulence problems or at least far far less smelly ones. I could also feed them a little less in order to maintain their proper weight as opposed to the other brands, it had too much filler. My pets seem to be much happier, more energetic, much healthier looking, and have less smelly farts."
"A Salty, In-Between Meals Kinda Snack!...","These bars are GREAT as a hefty snack. You want something more then a handful of chips, but it's not yet lunch or dinner time...grab a Big Nut Bar! There are TONS of peanuts in each bar, and I thought them to have a perfect amount of salt (some may think them too salty, but I love a lot of salt). I'd definitely recommend these for peanut fans, or people who eat a lot of 'snacks-on-the-go'. Planters certainly didn't skimp on the nuts...very tasty!"
Hit or miss,"These taste good, but the quality of the nuts used is inconsistent. Sometimes the nuts are painfully hard and brownish, looking like an almond you found in the couch cushion years after someone dropped it in there. They are nice and crispy, but sometimes they are too hard to bite."
Get real Amazon!,"Come on Amazon...........$56 for this salsa???  It is very tasty and has many uses, but it is about $3 a jar in the grocery store last time I looked. Hmmmmm.....50% off??  I don't think so.  You really have to know prices to shop for anything on Amazon!"
Great Value,"I received this recently, only cooked with it a few times but I'm very pleased. It's pleasingly sweet, makes a good dressing. I sprinkled it on chicken pieces several times while it was baking. Delicious. I'm looking forward to recipes that call for a balsamic reduction. I would buy again but that's way down the road. This is a big container."
it will spoil little pussy,"My cat is fussy-and I wondered if she would like these incredibly ornate packaged delicasies.Well she went wild,and now holds out for this special set of flavors. I would get wordy here but the textures and smells entice my cat,and she is always tail up and eager when she sees these cans!Petite cuisine has sophisticated gormet taste(i think),and the packaging once again is unrivaled."
"Light, Clean, Refreshing","One of my favorite coconut waters along with O.N.E. Guava flavor.  Tastes great, but a bit sweet.  Wish it contained less sugar and carbs, but you can cut with water.  Has a mild cotton candy taste.  From personal experience, coconut juice/water is a great thing to drink to cut hunger, headaches, and improve energy."
My Fave Flavor!,This is by far my favorite flavor of the Kind Bars!  Great Gluten Free snack when you're on the go!  Delicious!
I love these nuts.,"They come in convenience small package.  The flavor is good.  When I'm hungry, one pack gives me all the energy I need.  I would recommend it to other because it's worth the money."
YUMMY!,These are great tasting snacks.  We love the chocolate and the cheesecake flavors.  Much easier to buy on Amazon.
The BEST Hemp Milk!,"Pacific hemp milk is the best! It is so creamy and delicious.  I love heating the vanilla with cacao powder and dessicated coconut for hot chocolate in the colder months (sometimes I add a little agave, too).  This hemp milk is also so good mixed with Oregon Chai (liquid).  Pacific hemp milk can be tough to find!"
Fabulous flavor at an unbelievable price!,This is the buy of a lifetime.  $25 for about 50 beans instead of $10 for 2!  And the flavor was great.  Made ice cream that everyone raved about.  I vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible.
Taste awful!,"After reading all of the positive reviews for this product, I decided to try it.  It looked delicious, nice packaging, but the taste and smell were really bad.  It had a bad tomato smell and taste, it just tasted old, not fresh as I expected.  The dates on the packaging were fine, not out of date, but the taste was a different story.  Now I am stuck with 3 more jars and afraid to eat it again. I also ordered the Bruschetta as well.  Haven't tried it yet, I'm a little hesitant to try since I don't want to be disappointed again and know that I wasted even more money.  Lesson learned, I won't buy anything from Amazon again without knowing more about the product or having tasted it before. I will stick with my favorite sauces from Patsy's (NY restaurant with same name).  They are sold in select grocery stores.  They are jarred sauce but taste amazing and fresh."
"Strong flavor, acquired taste for sure","I decided to try the spread after hearing about if on community channel on youtube.  Dont like it!  Very strong, biter taste.  Not my cup of tea"
Ice Breakers,All perfect BUT would like to be able to have on Auto order every 90 days -  how can I do this?
Spicy and delicious,"I love jerky.<br />When it comes to fresh organic jerky nothing beats Ed's Roadhouse.<br />But for store bought variet?<br />Jack Links is where it's at.<br />The jalapeno version has just the right amount of heat and kick to make this one of the best store varieties out there.<br />Not too tough, not too stringy.<br />Just.......right.<br />Too bad I mow through the whole bag in one sitting..  :)<br />Highly recommended."
Moravian Meyer Lemon Cookies,"These cookies have a great, lemony taste.  The only bad thing was that they're thin and many of them were broken."
Excellent Ingredient for Superb Hot Chocolate,"I made Bellagio Sipping Chocolate just the way the instructions read, then went on to add other ingredients: cinnamon, powdered instant coffee, hazelnut extract, and a few other spices.  It's great, either as it is supposed to be mixed or as an ingredient for other hot chocolate drinks.  Just add a little sugar."
yum,"Little one loves these and glass is recyclable forever which plastic (Gerber) is not. About the same price, food is healthier and she's more likely to eat this stuff."
"Flavorful, fruity green tea","I am not a diehard tea drinker and am a diet coke junkie.  That said - I liked the idea of trying the health benefits of green tea and, lately, have found a hot cup of tea a great way to start/end the day.<br /><br />This tea is fruity and not bitter.  I add a packet of sweetner in the AM and it is perfect.  I highly recommend this one!!"
Pretty tasty!,"We ordered this for a small group of people at my job. So far, no complaints and we all seem to be enjoying it! We read that it's a low acid coffee (guess they have some coffee shops on the west coast, but none here where we are) and several people (including me) have noted that they haven't had any stomach troubles since we started drinking this. We had a little hiccup with the initial shipment (missing 10 bags and the individual bags weren't labeled -- reason for less than 5 star review), but Amazon was great about taking care of this and we plan to continue to get this coffee. Great find for the price!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Got our second shipment today and all the items were in the box -- still not individually labeled, though. We're still enjoying the coffee."
"Wow, awesome this stuff rocks","We have tried many different types of sauces/rubs and have never been as impressed as we are with Mr Teagues. My team of 15 is from all over the states so the different tastebuds are abundant, this stuff covered them all and walked away as king."
Shirataki Pasta,"I ordered a couple of packages of these...the shipping took FOREVER (close to a month) - the noodles taste almost identical to ""real"" pasta...I'll order again!"
Just can't each one,"These bars, as small as they are, can either be a solution to your diet or the absolute end to it.  If you can eat one of these small bars as a dessert, then you are making progress.  If on the other hand you grab a handful and end up with a graveyard of open wrappers, you've just blown all your hard (diet) work.<br /><br />So, if you love Crunch (who doesn't?), and you can control yourself, buy these.  I tried and succeeded, for a while.  Then, the bag was just too much to resist, and my monitor had wrappers everywhere.  For me, it was just too tempting, alas..."
Excellent bars,"I have ordered these Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants KIND bars at other sites, and have been very happy with all the flavors I can get. Because I wanted to have a box of this flavor only (not a variety pack), I ordered these bars. Great flavor and they feel ""so healthy."" Give tham a try. You won't be sorry."
Great for low sodium diets,I use it in all my baking. Has no sodium but works very well  Can't tell the difference from regular baking powder.
Tiramisu dessert,"After many attempts at creating this wonderful dessert in my home, I have found this to be the easiest and most delicious.  Next best thing to Olive Garden's famous dessert."
"No,Thanks","I was really excited to try this product, but I did not like it at all. I bought it around two weeks ago,and it is still there, almost new and that is weird because I love caramel and sweet things."
Great product for your dog !,"Have used greenies since they came out and they definitely help keep your dog's teeth clean. My dog gets excited about being treated to a Greenie everyday. The pricing was very attractive through Amazon, as much as half of what you would pay at a pet store. Very impressed with the product."
lots of fun,"Highly entertaining to watch.  Both of my dogs LOVE it.  The older one has a little more trouble with it,but he can do it!  He hasn't quit figured out that he has to move the yellow cups before the wheel will turn.  On the other hand my younger dog thought that removing the yellow cups WAS the game.  Had to show him that there was something inside.  Does very well removing the cups now.  Timing him he is down to a little over 2 minutes.  You do have to show them how it works a few times if you don't have a super smart dog."
If I could give no stars,Um my mother described these as chips that went terribly wrong. Never again the taste was horrible!  The bag smells like feet. I literally could nor give these away. I think these people need to give up hope in the kale chip business. The birds in the back yard wouldn't even eat these!
Surprisingly tasty.,"I was a bit leery about ordering this product, but was pleasantly surprised by the taste.<br /><br />It is quick and easy to prepare and it is really a good base for a meal, I have added leftover chicken, vegetables and other leftovers and served it over rice.<br /><br />I served it over ""Knorr Asian Sides - Teriyaki Fried Rice"", and it was a great combination.<br /><br />I have since reordered and will keep doing so."
Great Treat,This is great! The price is better than any stores around here and my dogs love it! Now they don't mind taking their pills
Excellent Service!,"I ordered these Charms Blow Pops and received them in about 2 days.  It was the best service I've had in a while, and the price was excellent."
Miracle Stuff!,"It cured my dry, itchy, bumpy skin (arms & legs) by second day - just use it like lotion after shower while skin is still moist/damp (I used loofah scrub first).  My skin feels like baby skin and itching is gone.  It really smells nice after soaking into your skin, which happens pretty quickly, and greasiness is gone - I can't stop smelling my arms.<br /><br />Also use this in cooking a lot.  It was great with banana bread - just substitute 1/4 to 1/2 of melted butter called for in the recipe (don't substitute all the butter, I believe the bread will be drier if you just use coconut oil).  As a kid, we used pure coconut oil as hair conditioner in my hometown.  So tonight, I will use it on my heels because they are always dry since I wear sandals a lot.  I bought this in Amazon a while back and it was very cheap compared to WholeFoods price."
delicious and filling,"I still haven't figured out any recipes to use this in, but I can attest that it tastes good just spooned out of the jar, or spread on toast or crackers.  It also doesn't seem to take much to satisfy hunger cravings, so when I don't have time to fix a meal and don't want to grab a granola bar I sometimes just have a spoonful of this."
Conflicted about how to rate this,"I received a pack of this mix to try.  While I found the cooking time accurate, there was a flavor disappointment.  The chops came out very juicy, which was great.  I guess my biggest gripe is that the flavoring seemed so subtle because there wasn't enough on each chop.  I think the package amount should either increase, or the number of pork chops should be reduced to about four per package.  It seemed to me that the flavor was good when I scraped it together, but it definitely was too thin on each piece when the directions were followed.  Jim Fargiano, author of: The Spoken Words of Spirit: Lessons From The Other Side"
"YUM, YUM, YUM TERRIFIC","Great flavor and plenty of it! It's like eating chocolates: They are so rich in lime flavor you can only eat 2 or 3 at a time. The bite size morsels are perfect, lots of flavor and great cookie tastes blended together well. We will be buying more."
Earth's Best is the BEST,"We love the Earth's Best line in our house. Our 9 mo old daughter  will ONLY eat Earth's Best dinners, and I don't blame her. The smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. I've sampled the Earth's best dinners myself, and they aren't half bad... It is baby food.... The fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well."
Better order directly from Witmer,The Witmer company website offers 2 models and various combinations of lid width and jar height. I also had to return the Amazon item because I have Trader Joe jars. I have just ordered from Witmer directly.
Great Turkish Delight.,My son was doing a project/presentation on India for a world cultures fair (he is in 6th grade) and wanted to bring Turkish delight for his dish for the international luncheon.  Many children wanted to try it due to the description of it in The Chronicles of Narnia.  We have had Turkish delight from Turkey before and it is my son's favorite dessert.<br /><br />This was excellent quality.  I was pleased and happy to pick up some with my free two day shipping rather than drive all over trying to find some locally.
Good stuff,I tried this coffee on a recommendation by a friend. It is very<br />stout and has a mildly bitter finish. It WILL wake you up in the morning.
Cardboard,"These taste like cardboard.  These are the worst.  I can't give them away.  Here is a better low carb snack option:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQVFS"">Planters Deluxe Whole Cashews with Pure Sea Salt, 2 lb Units, (Pack of 2)</a>"
NEWMAN'S OWN,NEWMAN'S OWN SPECIAL BLEND IS A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE. AND I REALLY LIKE THE WAY THE PROFITS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO CHARITY. GREAT COFFEE... GREAT PERSON WHO GAVE BACK... GREAT PURCHASE.
Love it!!!,Love this product!. I used it instead of butter in some cookies and they tasted amazing!. Great deal!
Tender Jerky from the USA....,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:19 Mins<br /><br /></span>Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips, Pepper, 16-Ounce Bag<br /><br />Having a little fun today, did this review of the Wild Ride Jerky.<br /><br />After searching through lots of Jerky brands I found this to be one of the best around.<br /><br />ONE POUND bags are the way to go, my grocery store keeps putting less and less in larger bags.<br /><br />As with any beef Jerky it is really best to keep it sealed in your refrigerator.<br /><br />Funny to see how many reviews say jerky became moldy!  good jerky that is not over seasoned with preservatives will not last long in open air or heat....<br /><br />This is top quality US meat and seasoned lightly and marinated in a special formula to make it tender.<br /><br />I hope this is entertaining and helpful."
School Project,These were great.  Fit in perfect for my sons report on Tirkey.  The kids in his class loved them.  They tasted wonderful.  PERFECT!
very disappointing,"I was very excited to find this product, but once they arrived (the firts time) , I opened the box, and was hit with the odor of rancid oil...the cups were rancid...<br />I contacted amazon, and a replacement was sent VERY QUICKLY, but alas, no odor, but the cups were stale and nasty...Amazon refunded my order promptly, but I am still disappointed that the cup were so awful."
great flavor and texture,"--great flavor and texture<br />--tastes good and natural, not artificial<br />--wow natural latex rubber is chewy, I'd never had it before and it has a much better texture than other gum<br />--this gum is made from birch and not GMO corn, so as I understand it, this is the ""good xylitol"""
Great tea!,"I originally bought this tea for boosted energy after I quit drinking coffee. But, a few weeks later I went through two sudden deaths within my family. I normally don't handle grieve or death well at all and usually can't get out of bed for weeks after someone dies. I drank this tea knowing the rhodiola was for stress relief. I was able to function normally as I would if no one died or if there were no stress at all in my life. This tea saved me I recommend to everyone, even if you're not under stress like I was. Its fantastic stuff."
Yummy Iced Coffee,"I'll start by saying that I'm usually not a fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I decided to try this since I love iced coffee and don't always feel like making a coffee run every time I want some.  With that being said, this coffee is delicious, not to mention incredibly convenient.  I start my day by taking a shaker cup filled with skim milk, a packet of coffee, and an equal or two, shake it up and throw it in the fridge.  Then whenever I want some iced coffee it's prepared and ready to go.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would prefer if it came unsweetened.  Obviously, since I add equal I don't find it to be too sweet, but I don't really use sugar and would prefer if I could just use my choice of sweetener instead."
Delicious Tea,I love this tea. It is delicious. It came in a timely manner and I was very pleased.
Great limited edition flavor..,"I was skeptical about salsa flavored potato chips. I usually pair salsa with corn chips, because of the complimentary taste combination of corn with the salsa ingredients. How would potato chips do with this? Well, I am happy to say that these chips are tangy, they have a bite to them and it is actually a great flavor to try, if you haven't already. They are more savory than spicy."
"Wish there was a ""Package Contains"" on it.","I have tried other GF Bread Mixes and here is my delema; My bread machine has a Gluten Free setting. It automatically goes to a 1 1/2 lb loaf. One mix I have used (Gluten Free Pantry)contained ingredients for a 2 lb loaf. Needless to say it didn't bake long enough.<br /><br />In this one ""I think"" each package contains ingredients for a 1 lb loaf; hence I will have to use 1 1/2 bags per loaf of bread..? Is there yeast in the package just like the Gluten Free Pantry Bread Mix (I would prefer to use my own)? I guess I will find out when I receive my order. I may add some honey and flax to my recipe and see how it goes. I think this one will produce a more nutritious, lower calorie bread so that is why I am purchasing it. Thank you to all the reviewers."
Siljans bread  from Amazon.com,"Being swedish living in the US, i miss a few of my favourite foods.<br />The Swedish crisp breads was one i really missed and the ones in local stores were not  very tasty. Siljans crisp bread to the rescue.It is crisp and tastes fresh, I highly recommend it.<br />Amazon ships fast and it is packed securely, no breakage."
Mmmmmm,Nice product !  Tried for a hair repair treatment .... worked nicely !  Plan on cooking with the coconut oil as well
Don't know why,I don't know why this got such good reviews but my Yorkshire really doesn't like it. He likes Iams more than this and it's cheaper.
gluten free tomato soup,"Heinze tomato soup is a great source fo celiac disease patients or gluten sensitive patients to enjoy ready made soup. Campbells is not gluten free. The soup is fast, easy and tastes great."
EXCELLENT,"Flawless transaction, fresh, no leaks [that some say this product has from OTHER sellers.]  Quick shipping too.  Wonderful and helpful to me on the phone as well! Will only buy from them.  Thank you"
Good Stuff,"I have been a long time fan of this product.  ""Trader Joes"" used to sell SnackMasters Turkey Jerky in their stores but replaced it (much to my disappointment!) with their own inferior product.<br />I do find the quality of the turkey jerky better in the larger 3.5 ounce size.  I have found the product in the smaller size bags to be hard and less fresh.<br />Other wise I love the stuff....."
Will purchase from this seller again,I love my new M&M dispenser.  I can't believe I even found it.  It's certainly a collector's item and will forever stay in a box on display.  The service I received from the seller was great - quick and easy.  I will purchase from this seller again.
Yummy,"Fabulous cookie.  Perfect size.  Love packaging.  No more stale cookies.  Senior size, just enough with a cup of coffee (or tea) for a snack.  Wish all food was like that."
Great stuff!,"This cocoa powder is a very good price and it is super tasty! Very rich and chocolaty and I usually put 2 teaspoons in a mug with hot water and I add cinnamon and agave for a touch of sweetness, but it is good alone too. Delicious in smoothies too, I would definitely recommend this product."
Worth Purchasing,"Goes well as a side when I make steak tips or grilled chicken. My non-gluten free husband loves this rice and there are NEVER leftovers. It's easy to make and I love the taste and texture.<br /><br />Also, I'm diabetic and eating a serving of this product does not effect my blood sugar at all. So it's a win!"
Dogs love it,"I have 2 big dogs and they LOVE these treats in their everlasting balls.  My Golden Retriever can make one treat last 2 days, but the black lab cruches the ball and eats the entire thing in 30 minutes."
"Just because a food has the word ""Energy"" in its name doesn't mean you'll get an energy boost...","I received a sample of this candy through the vine program. I chose it because it had the word ""Energy"" in the title, and there are some times when I feel like I could use a boost. Those times are not frequent, mind you, but it's nice to have something on hand when you want it. The first night I tried this candy was on Halloween, as I escorted my children through the surrounding neighborhoods with some other parents. I popped on of these in my mouth, as did another parent I had offered it to. We both thought the taste was good (if you like honey, you'll like these, for sure, as that's all you can taste), but neither of us felt any sort of energy boost as we spent a few hours walking around. My wife tried one the next day (thought it was a bit too sweet) and said she felt a slight energy boost. I had another one the next day and offered one to a co-worker, who accepted. As before, neither of us felt any noticeable bump in out energy levels. Maybe the energy boost is psychosomatic? You WANT to feel it, so some people decide they DO feel it? I don't know. For me, it just boiled down to this being a good-tasting candy that had slightly more dietary value than most candies. Would I buy it in the store? Probably not."
Grove Square Caramel Cuppccino Keurig K-Cups,K-Cups that taste good.  I was supprised at how good this coffee tastes.  I like it and so do others in the house.
Nice Kit!,"I made 3 of these kits in the past and they came out very good for the price.  The last batch I made I did in a 5 gallon quanity in hopes there would be a little more body to it as some reviews said.  I found no change in the body from 6 to 5 gallons and ended up with 24 bottles instead of the 29 or 30 bottles I usually get from the 6 gallon instructions.  I opened a bottle I made from a 6 gallon batch that was bottled in December, 2011 and it was very good!  I WILL NOT make another kit in a 5 gallon batch!"
She loved it...but eventually did it in...,"This is possibly one of my German Shepherd/Border Collie pups FAVORITE toys ever...that being said she did manage to do it in. She is an aggressive chewer and managed to chew off the rubber around the top of the jug- which made it unsafe for her to keep playing with. It did keep her busy for hours trying to get her food or treats out of it.<br /><br />If you do have an aggressive chewer check out the squirrel dude...same concept of a treat to eat toy- not as much room inside and easier to do so it doesn't last as long at least for my dog- but it has stayed in one piece! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A63P5Q"">Premier Squirrel Dude Large</a>"
Dan's Perfect Popcorn,"Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe."
"Finally,  toaster pastries that are good for you!!!",It is very hard to find organic products where I live.  I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them.  I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon.  We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!
Great Dessert available now from Amazon,"Junket dessert is a fast, easy, and delicious topping for cake or fresh berries.  Always a hit with family or guests."
"Good quality, fast delivery","I bought these to make homemade vanilla.  The quality of beans was very good.  Very ""meaty"" and full of beans.  It was also received very quickly and they were well packaged in a vacuum sealed package.  Would buy from this seller again."
constant level of quality,The quality and taste of this item is consistant from packet to oacket. Others have disapointed me and I just tossed out.
YUMMMMMMMM,"I ordered these as a gift and they arrived in perfect condition.  Fortunately, the recipient chose to share them with me, so I got to enjoy them.  These are very good, economically priced milk chocolate truffles.  I will most certainly be ordering them again."
Great Coffee,I ordered this coffee having never tried it and I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a great aroma and a very nice taste.  I would recommend this coffee to anyone.
"If you enjoy candy corn, this is worth buying",The candy corn was of decent quality.  I would buy this product again.  My biggest gripe is that this product wasn't available when I actually attempted to order it again.
Yummy!,"These are excellant treats for diabetic animals.  All natural, no added ingredients. I used to make home made liver treats but no more since I found these.<br />My dog loves them.<br />Good product and fast service."
Great Buy for Keurig,This was a great buy for the Keurig K-cups! The packaging was thrills-free and green. The flavor of this coffee is good and doesn't get that watered down effect that some k-cups give. I would order this package again.
Great Coffee Gift From a Non-Coffee Drinker,"I have now bought Tully's coffee twice as a gift. I am not a coffee drinker whatsoever; however, I have lived in two places known for coffee: Seattle and Italy (espresso, anyone?). My relatives exclaim that Arabica coffee from Cafe Mexico in Naples, Italy, is the world's best, but if you want a high-quality coffee from an American brand, I haven't gone wrong with Tully's yet.<br /><br />My coffee-drinking friends and co-workers in Seattle said that Tully's is by far the best Seattle coffee chain (better than Peete's, Seattle's Best, and for certain, Starbucks). The only better American coffee comes from the little drive-up shack."
Your own mocha and it won't cost you $5 per cup,"Here you have an excellent tasting product that isn't THAT bad for you - even the carb-conscious folks. One serving has 28g of sugars and 2g of fiber - yes, fiber even. That's 4 tablespoons. I, personally, only need 2 so cut that in half, which is the same sugars as a light yogurt.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the best part. If you are like me and have grown addicted to the sweet tasting mochas from any of the number of specialty coffee places out there (Tully's, Peet's, Starbucks, etc.), but you hate paying $4-$5 for your fix, check this out.<br /><br />Buy your favorite coffee (I like Peet's house blend myself) and brew your regular coffee. Yes, you don't need a $1,000 espresso machine to do this. Add 2-4 tablespoons of ""Ghirardelli Hot Chocolate Mix , Chocolate Mocha"" to a large, dry cup (I use 2), pour in your hot coffee. Mix thoroughly. Now, add your favorite creamer (I like Mocha Mix light or nonfat lactose free milk). Stir. And, you have yourself a darn good mocha w/out the espresso machine hassle or the cost.<br /><br />Now, throw it in your favorite spill-free travel coffee cup and head off to work bypassing the unsuspecting grumpies standing in line for 10-minutes waiting to pay $5 for their chocolaty caffeinated beverage. Just smile knowing now you have an extra $100+ per month for something else.<br /><br />Excuse me whilst I take another sip of mine."
Jack Link's,"Years ago this jerky was King B Jerky and was the best Jerky in the world.  Even with the name change, the company, Jack Link's is still the best flavored jerky.  The original flavor is my favorite!"
My dog loves it!,We adopted an adult mix last year who was in need of love and care.  His coat is now soft and shiny and the amount of waste he produces is significantly down from when he ate other food.  Well worth it to me.
Great tasting low cal chips!,"These chips are the best tasting low calorie snacks I have ever tasted! A normal sized chip snack pack is only 100 calories and they do NOT taste fake. They do NOT taste like cardboard. They taste delicious. My husband, who will not eat anything that is ""diet"" or ""low fat"", loves these. I have never found such a great tasting salty snack. They taste like good old fashioned potatoe chips should taste - crisp and light."
"a dark chocolate lovers' delight, a blueberry lover's disappointment","""Cocoa"" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars."
Walnutty,"I ordered Fastachi's walnut, pistachio, and hazelnut butter. This was the cheapest. I love walnuts. It's the only ingredient so if you like walnuts, you'll like this!"
Tasty and nice to snack on,"I ate this dry, and it was nice to snack on. My daughter (age 5) really liked just snacking on it out of a bowl. This would nice on ice cream or yogurt.  The granola comes in different size pieces (all bite size) and the chocolate and fruit pieces are real small. It doesn't have a real strong chocolate or berry taste."
Good stuff,Surprisingly with pulp taste a lot better than without pulp one.<br /><br />Pulp is just few tiny pieces of coconut floating and not really much pulp.
Great on sugar-free/low carb ice cream,"I think how much you will like this depends on a) how many other sugar-free chocolate syrups you've tried, and b) how you plan on using the syrup.  If you have tried a lot of sugar-free syrups, you will like this one.  If you're used to sugared syrups, you will find that this product, like other sugar-free products, takes some getting used to.  For me, some of this on top of my low carb vanilla ice cream with some nuts works just fine, and I feel like I'm getting a real treat.  I haven't tried guzzling it by itself or with milk, or in coffee (really?  yuck).  I can't imagine the Hershey's version is made for coffee, and even Toriani, which IS made for coffee, doesn't taste very good (although my niece likes it)."
superb flavor,i use this to make my own pork breakfast sausage and flavor soups and stews. will continue to buy Frontier products
Great Treats!!!,My Cavalier Spaniel learned to sit within minutes. She is only 11 weeks old and will do anything for these treats!
Good...not Great...,"These are pretty good... better than a lot of the other snacky foods out there. My friend suggested coating them with white chocolate and making ""snowman poop""...I bet that would be yummy! If your trying to cut down on how much junk you eat then these are a good alternative. Nice light flavor but honestly doesn't fill you up."
Not a flavor I care for,"I regularly put lemon juice in a glass of water because it is refreshing. I use fresh ginger root in cooking. I drink hot tea 2-3 times a week. I had hight hopes for this beverage. I tried it hot. The lemon came through, then the ginger, then the feeling of heat. But the after taste was like medicine. I added some honey. It was an improvement but nothing I cared to have again. I give it a neutral rating because it has the lemon-ginger flavor advertised, but its not something I want to drink."
Tasty treat and no guilt as a meal,Having a toddler who wants to feed himself but yet cannot quite manage a bowl of cereal on his own is a challenge. This particular product though provides a relatively easy solution in that it is a fruit and grain at the same time.  Still overall you are paying for the convenience and packaging. That is frustrating.  Plus the packages are just over 3oz each. Even my peanut can down 3 of these in 1 sitting. With each being (currently) $1.24 each it creates a very expensive meal.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to use - toddlers can feed themselves<br />Easy to travel - I like to keep some in the car to avoid fast food stops<br />Healthy alternative to some other snacks<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cost!<br />Trash accumulates
Breakfast  Blend by Green Mountain,I love my Breakfast Blend coffee from Green Mountain. It light without a bitter aftertaste. It is a good everyday morning cofffee for me I would  recommend this to anyone who likes a light not bitter cooffe if you like a really strong cup of joe in the morning this isn't you coffee
SO GOOD,"I DO NOT EVEN CARE IF THIS IS OVERPRICED, THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. THERE'S NOT A TON OF MEAT IN EACH PACKAGE, BUT IT HITS THE SPOT. GOOD LORD, THESE TASTE SO DELICIOUS, I DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT MORE TO SAY."
Dog loves them,"These are fantastic ways to get the dog to take her pills.  They work well and make life a lot easier.  The small pills are a lot smaller than in a previous purchase buying the larger ones.  Since our dog takes a lot of pills, I would pay slightly more for the larger ones because it would be more cost effective in the future.<br /><br />Again, these are fantastic and really makes life a lot easier."
Greatest invention since sliced bread!!,"I discovered Popchips when I was on a trip to Vegas.  I doubted I could find them when I got home and I was almost right.  I found a couple of stores that had them but only one flavor and the price was exhorbitant.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  They are low fat, low calorie, and still delicious.  The single serve bags are ideal for lunch or to throw in the car when on a short trip."
great value,"Dog likes product, I like the way the bag seals, keeping product fresh. We will certainly continue to purchase this product"
Allergy solver.,"My dog was shedding excessively and constantly had allergy problems, even on the once a day vet allergy pills. Switched her over to this food and she does not even have to take the pills anymore. Make sure to adjust the amount you feed according to the back of the bag as this will make your dog porky if you give it too much and do not have a very high activity level. Was very easy to switch her over. Mixed it in 20/80 with her old stuff and she picked out all the Orijen and ate it and left the old stuff on the first day. She was eating it regularly with no bad side affects from then on."
Can't keep these away from my husband!!,"I've taken our family organic over the past year.  In order to get family ""buy in"" I decided my approach would be to start with sweets ;)  These types of cookies are ones that my husband likes so I got the organic version to see if he would like them.  Well...we're still organic!  Not only did he like them, he didn't even notice.  He still hoards them and insists they are only ""his"".  I enjoy them as do our 3 kids.  The only problem is we go through a case in no time!"
Great product - but don't buy it here,This is a great product for traveling with newborns who need Nutramigen (go to the Enfamil website for product info and customer reviews).  But don't bother buying it here.  Buy from RiteAid online and the same product is $10 with free shipping over $25 and ships in 3-5 business days... rather than weeks here.
Dog loves these!,"My corgi loves them, which is great. Unfortunately they do have kind of a warm kelp on the beach smell to them."
One of the weakest coffees I've ever had,Even on the 6 oz setting this coffee is so weak I can't drink it.  I've had at 20 flavors of K-cups and this is the worst.
Really good!,"This is really good syrup, better than what is available to me at local grocery stores. It is strong and a little goes a long way. Additional sweetener is not necessary when I put this in my coffee. So far, we have only used it in coffee, but I am planning to use it in other ways soon."
A K-Cup Really???????????,"I was excited to find a reasonably priced K-cup coffee.  That is until I purchased it and tried it.  This is instant coffee -it is dishonest to call it a K-Cup.  You expect real coffee whey you purchase a K-cup.  Save yourself the cost - if you really want instant coffee, buy yourself a jar of instant coffee and grab a spoon."
Best Sea Salt I've Ever Used!,"Over the years I've randomly picked up various sea salts hoping to find that perfect salt crystal that almost looks like it formed into tiny little delicate flakes. After running through quite a few, salt shakers, salt grinders, natural sea salts, salts harvested by natives who have been doing it for hundreds of years, you name it! They all seem to come up the same for me, the texture is never right. Even salt grinders can't get that perfect texture. So to make a long story short, I picked a shaker of this stuff up in the health food store one day and haven't looked back since. I've found my perfect salt! The texture is flawless; flakey and just slightly clumpy without over doing it. About the only thing I can say that's negative is the shaker dispensers tend to clump at the top and it takes an occasional reverse tap to clear the holes. Not a big deal though.<br /><br />I do wish you could buy one bag of this stuff instead of 6! The salt shakers are 7.5 ounces and last me forever. These bags are 35.3 ounces and there's 6 of them! If you have extended family then I suggest you give a  bag to each family member and save one for yourself. Otherwise don't hesitate to get this stuff, I love it!"
Fizzies instant drink tablets,"I loved Fizzies when I was a kid.  As I recall, they stopped making them because they contained cancer causing chemicals called cyclamates.  My daughter bought me a box of the new one's in root beer flavor and I was really looking forward to a retro experience.  This was the most God-awful thing I've ever drank.  It tasted nothing like root beer.  I would describe the taste as more like a really bad, chemically laced, unsweetened tea.  I ended up dumping it in the sink.  I would like to believe I've just lost my sense of taste in my middle age but I really don't think that is the problem.  These things just don't taste anything like the product that was out in the 60's and early 70's.  If the taste of your own urine wouldn't bother you, you might enjoy Fizzies.  Keep in mind that they contain Sorbitol which, in modest quantities can cause gas, bloating and assorted digestive ills."
I have used this product for years!,"I still love this product, and have yet to find a protein replacement that tastes better than this using completely organic and raw ingredients. Chocolate, gluten free, and VEGAN!?!?! Doesn't get much better than that in my book! Perfect for supplementing vitamins from a whole food source. Wish it had a little more protein in it, but other than that great!!"
Packaging is misleading,"I bought a big bag of these and I don't mind the strong pepper taste. What I do mind is the bag implies these are Potato chips.<br /><br />There is absolutely no potato taste left in this snack; if you like eating extremely salty onion powder this snack is for you.<br /><br />Going by the bag I expected: REAL potatos, a little oil and baking, finally sprinkled with salt and pepper only? Not a long list with things like Cane Sugar, Rice flour, maltodextrin......list of ingredients goes on and on.<br /><br />If you're looking for BAKED POTATO, salt and pepper chips don't bother with these!<br /><br />--VS"
Very good,We are very happy with this products. Probably this is ons of the best tea with Chamomile. We would recommend it to everyone.
Too SOUR!,"I love sour food but this one I can't bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I don't like it."
jolly rancher watermelon candies,"Whoa, jolly rancher watermelon candies are sooooooooooooooooo delicious.  Can't just have one, once you start you can't stop eating them."
Best Hot Chocolate ever,I purchased this for my girlfriend who loved this stuff over the Xmas period. Now she has a supply which should last several months.
"Weak, but tasty!","This product met my expectations very well.  The flavor wasn't quite what I expected, however.  I expected a cinnamon flavor with subtle hints of hazelnut and vanilla.  Instead, I found that all three flavors are pretty evenly distributed.  The end result is a cacophony of flavors which is very powerful and distracts from the natural coffee flavor.<br /><br />The beans themselves are rather small.  Because of this, I think, the coffee is rather weak.  I find myself having to use 30% more coffee per pot than with my traditional coffee beans.  The cup, when poured black, has a very weak color to it, if you add creamer the look is very reminiscent of tea with milk.<br /><br />When I first tried the coffee I was very unhappy with the results.  However, after tweaking the amount of grounds I use (as well as increasing the coarseness of my grounds) I found a product that was palatable.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Probably not.  However, I can see many people who dislike strong coffee truly enjoying this."
"grainy, bland & time-consuming to use","Basically: a rock-hard block that must be run under hot water 20 minutes before it can be squeezed from plastic packaging. Grainy and bland after all that effort, too. Get canned coconut milk."
"REALLY, REALLY, GOOD-WISH THE COMPANY WOULD CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE MORE!!!!!!!!!","These are the best! I wish the company would care enough about their customers to make more of them.  You would think since so many people keep requesting them that they would do something about it.  Actually, when a company doesn't honor the many requests for them to make them again, it really turns me off to keep supporting the company. So, I just won't buy their products any longer. Too bad, but it is the only way to let them know we mean buisness."
Good Buy,"Better than expected, but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste. This is a good purchase for the price."
happy babies,"My twin boys are happy with their formula.  I use it to supplement w/ breast milk if I do not have enough.  It doesn't smell as much as other formula's and I feel good that it's more wholesome & organic.  Worth the price, especially when it goes on sale."
It smells so good I tasted it myself!,"I bought Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison Recipe on the advice of my vet, when food allergy was suspect in a rash my dog had. Turns out the dog had a run-of-the-mill skin rash, but since switching over to this a few months ago I see my old girl having more energy and readily eating at mealtime.<br />My usually picky dog LOVES it and I feel really good about feeding this good-quality food to her.<br />The convenience of buying it online from Amazon with free shipping, and having it delivered to my front door is an added bonus.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CJJ9C"">Natural Balance Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Limited Ingredient Diet Venison and Sweet Potato Recipe, 15 Pound Bag</a>"
This formula is terrible!,"I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn't work."
Addicted to this tea,Love this tea. Has a very mild flavor but that's enough for me. Received some as a Christmas gift a few years ago. Been addicted ever since. Just can't find it in a store any more. Have to order it here.
just what i was looking for.,This product is exactly what I needed.  It came in a timely manner and had no complaints.
CATS go crazy over this stuff.,"This is the only canned cat food my cats will eat.  I tried everything else and had absolutely no luck.  My cats would just walk away.  But this cat food, Natural Balance Chicken green pea formula,  they will eat and appear to enjoy .  They also like duck and pea and salmon.  Good stuff!"
El Pavo de thanksgiving se lo comieron en Navidad,"Lo compr&eacute; como regalo para mi familia en USA, me dicen que est&aacute; muy bueno, sabe a jam&oacute;n navide&ntilde;o.<br />Cesar Marchegiani<br />Venezuela."
Mint?,"This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but . .  where is the mint!?  Very, very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box, I really expected more flavor."
"Great bags, great size!","These bags were bought for our school function use, and were great!  They are a great size and so easy to use.  I would definitely buy these again, so convenient and you get 500!!"
"Clean tasting water, convenient bottle size","I found this to be a great tasting water. It's crisp, clean and has a smooth, refreshing taste to it. I didn't taste saltiness or any noticeable flavor. The larger 1.5 liter bottle is convenient for bringing to the gym to keep hydrated during a workout or for a long day at work. I can't say I could tell if the 9.5 pH or electrolytes made a difference or not, but I did like the taste better than the average bottle of water. I had to take a star off because although it's a good water, the price is a little on the high side for me."
Not so great.,We got my wife a Keurig for Mothers day.  I bought the apple cider for the kids.  They were not impressed.  I tasted it after getting a few frowns.  If you like good apple cider - this will disappoint.  We will not buy again.
Misleading photo but still very tasty!,"My kids really enjoy this cereal probably because it so sweet. If you have had Nut & Honey Crunch, it tastes very similar.<br />The image on the box shows each piece coated in nut flakes, far from accurate! You will find a few nut flakes on most of the corn flakes, some with none at all.<br />The cereal stays crunchy for a decent amount of time in milk and is very satisfying to eat.<br /><br />I have't tried them but I imagine these would be a good coating for adding crunch to foods that can handle a sweet flavor. Perhaps over salmon, chicken, sweet potato casserole, etc."
Always have some in the fridge,"My husband and I couldn't be happier that we found these hemp seeds. Just purchased another bag as we go through quite a lot of it fast. The taste is somewhere between pine nuts and pecans, and is incredibly delicious. You really do feel like you're doing something great for your body just by eating it. One serving (3tbsps) contains 170 calories, 14g fat, 1g saturated fat, 2g carbs, 1g fiber, 11g protein and provides 16% daily iron. Excellent source or protein, so happy to have found it :)"
Sooooooooooooo Good!,This is one of my favorite teas by far! The taste that stands out to me is the ginger- and I love ginger.
tasty and healthy,"This is tasty and healthy. Nothing GMO, no corn syrup, and organic. I bought a case with subscribe and save. Very happy I did. I use this for the family and they enjoy it. None of them can tell the difference between this and  Heinz. I have been a ketchup love all my life eating it on anything and everything. I am very picky about ketchup. This organic brand, I love. I like it even better than Annie's organic. It also makes a great base for homemade BBQ sauce."
I thought these were raw walnuts but I was mistaken,"My fault not theirs, I did a search for raw,organic walnuts and these were the first to come up.  When reading the reviews these were referred to as raw walnuts so I did not do my homework.  Very disappointed that they are not raw so I cancelled my subscribe and save.  Too bad but back to the search."
useless - I feel no effects whatsoever,"I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry."
Good,"These are regular dried blackberries.  I was looking for freeze dried for use in cereal and I bought these thinking they might be freeze dried.<br /><br />I tried them in cereal and they were pretty good anyway, but not stellar.<br /><br />Regular dried blackberries are rather heavy, chewy, and when the fruit is dried, the ratio of fruit to seed is pretty low.  This makes me believe that these would be best reconstituted in cooking, such as baking.<br /><br />Also, both regular dried blackberries and freeze dried blackberries seem to take on an aromatic floral, slightly spicy taste that is not familiar in fresh blackberries.<br /><br />If you are looking for blackberries to reconstitute or use in baking, these are worth a try.<br /><br />If you are looking for freeze dried, then Just Blackberries brand or Harmony House brand both turned out to be very good."
Best Buddy Bits,"I ordered these to help in the training of my two dogs. They are great because they are small and they dissolve shortly after the dogs get them in their mouths. No waiting for them to chew during training. They were exactly what I wanted, and ordered, and were shipped out right away. I had them within a few days of placing the order. I would order from them again."
Really good stuff but hard to find,Really smooth.  Great flavor that isn't at all over powering.  You can't beat it.  Tastes as if it should cost a lot more.
Very tasty,This bowl is tasty and filling. I was shocked at the taste. A little high in sodium so I used half the bag as suggested. I will implement this into my diet at least twice a week for a quick veggie lunch.
Vegetarian Fast Food,"This product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan, and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce.  It can be added to any rice or noodle dish, or eaten plain with vegetables.  The taste is pleasing."
Great Coffee--competetive price!,"I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop ""regular"" but instead has ""Extra Bold"". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes."
Original Titus,"They had this at my local African market but ran out, so I went digging online: best decision ever. Packaging was excellent and it tasted good."
My Cat Loves Them!,AT first my cat was not really sure what to do with them other than play with them but he figured out really quickly that they where treats. Also having these around has kept him from chewing on everything so much. This was a really awesome buy and I plan on keeping these on hand at all times.
Did the trick for me,I started taking these 3 pills 3 times a day with plenty of water and pumping and was able to stash at least 10oz or more in the freezer everyday.  I'm a working mom so I pump before I leave for work and then 3-4 times during my 9hr work day and feed on demand when I'm home with my daughter.  I was also drinking milkmaid tea twice a day.  I'm sure if it was the combination of the two but I was very happy with the results.  My freezer is overflowing with milk and I have plenty in the fridge for daycare everyday.  I never had a problem with any of the side effects other complained of but I did have a break in use for about two weeks or so.  I was still able to produce enough with out it but I liked the idea of stashing plenty for rainy days.  I'm not a fan of the maple syrup smell in my sweat & urine though.
TONS of fiber!,"I'm not a very 'regular' guy so I purchased these to have for a tasty snack and to help with regularity. Well, after having eaten about a dozen over the past few weeks I can definitely say that the fiber does its job! These taste like you're having a candy bar, very good taste. The first couple times I ate one I did get a lot of stomach rumbling. I'm not sure if that was because my body wasn't used to so much fiber or what. Now I can eat them without that effect though."
Diabetes Management,Glucerna Oatmeal Raisin Mini Bars have proven to be an excellent food to<br />control and manage diabetes.<br />Diabetics should ask their doctor if Glucerna Oatmeal Raisin Mimi Bars<br />would be helpful in contolling and managing diabetes.
"First Impressions was they are small, then YUMMY!","Looking online at the pics you would think they would be as big OR LIKE cheetos but they are quite small & thin. AND very crunchy & delicious, YUMMY! I like that when I took scissors & snipped across the top of the bag off. All those crunchy bites overflow, they are VERY good & satisfying...definitely a winner!"
Excellent medium roast,"Realizing that these reviews are very subjective and it is hard to judge taste... these are my favorite K-cups so far and I have tried many. They are not too dark and not too weak, but with a great sweet and nutty flavor and are very consistent. If typical breakfast blends and the like are just too weak for you and the super-double dark ones are too bitter, give these a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For a ""taste preference"" reference point, I am also a big fan of Kona and Kona blends."
Baked Kettle chips,"Loved these chips.  They taste like real potatoes with less than one half the fat of regular chips.  I can eat these without feeling guilty and without sacrificing taste.  Eat them alone or with your favorite dips, and they are delicious.  When I found these I realized I don't have to give up one of my favorite snacks. If you are a potato chip fan but feel you have to eliminate chips from your diet, try these.  I did, and now I am a real fan."
Emeril Big Easy Bold K Cop,"Went through virtually every bold, dark coffee for my Keurig.  Emerils Big Easy Bold is the best dark coffee in the class, not in the slightest way bitter.  The pack of 50 is a great bargain,"
"Oh, this is good!","Chocolate, raspberries, strawberries, and organic to boot. What's not to like?  Okay, the package is too small.  This is awesome stuff.  I love it."
Guess I won't buy again,"My dog seems to like this just fine and dandy. She's happy to eat it but I don't like the fact that it is so mushy. She's not a big dog and it takes her forever to lap the food up. Yes, I know, it's probably good exercise having to work to eat her food but I don't like to have to work to eat my food so I don't want her to either."
Pleasantly Surprised,"I must admit, I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this thru the Vine program. I was wary of anything that is ""pre-flavored"". However, I was pleasantly surprised. When you open up the bag the smell is wonderful. And the taste is complex. Some people have complained that the vanilla flavor is not pronounced enough, but I find it to be just right. It is definitely there, but not overwhelming. There is another nice flavor in there which I couldn't quite place, but after reading the ingredient list on the bag I assume it is the Sarsaparilla Root. The coffee is slightly bitter, which adds to the complex flavor. (There is a yin-yang thing going on with the sweeter flavors.) I like a very strong, dark roast and I find that this falls into that category although Starbucks advertises it as a medium roast. Overall, I think this is a winner."
ZICO - Great stuff - a bit expensive!,ZICO Coconut Water is great stuff.  I wish I could find it somewhere where it wasnt soo expensvie.  It is a bit expensive!
Best tandoori spice,"I tried many tandoori spices. This one is the best. It is worth the extra price. I am buying only that brand now. It is really the best one. I use it with chicken breast cut in small pieces marinate with olive oil and the spice over night, cook and add crush tomatoes and then cream and served with basmati rice. Excellent."
"Good food, wrong product!!!","I ordered this for my 7 month old who LOVES this food. I ordered the 4.22 oz pack of 16, but received 3.5 oz pack of 14. I'm about to return it and ask for the correct product to be sent, but had I not looked closely, I would've just accepted this. Just be careful and make sure you're getting what you ordered. It says it comes from Amazon, but I'm wondering if there's a Happy Baby problem as well...the nutrition facts on the box don't match the nutrition facts on the pouch for the same 3.5oz serving. For example, the box says there's 100% daily value of Vitamin C while the pouch says 27%. I'm wondering if anyone else sees any discrepancies? I would think this would be illegal?"
Emergency car kit must-have!!!,"The Similac bottled formula is what you will find in my emergency car kit. I breastfeed at home and on the go but a situation arose that I was not able to nurse our son Henry. We were stuck in traffic and were nowhere near an exit. Thankfully this was in the ECK and I was able to open one up, place a disposable nipple and feed the hungry baby. The formula when sealed after the first use can be stored for a few hours in the refrigerator or cooler. This formula did not have an awkward foul odor or color. The option to be able to use inexpensive disposable nipples is wonderful.<br /><br />To sum it up, this product does what it intends to do. Provide a sterile, simply, and convenient method of feeding baby on the go."
Really helps mobility,I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky/beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty broken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.
"Hetrbal Teas,Chamomile",This is an outstanding product!! The test is great and lives up to it's ancient name Roman Apples. Altogether  a warm comfortable taste and calming nature.
Robin C,"I ordered this item, and I ended up wasting $12.00 because they were terrible. Very bland, and tasted stale.<br /><br />I would never order any other products from Kay's natural line."
Really Good quality Matcha,"I am not a tea or matcha expert; I have only been drinking matcha for about three years. Even so, this is the best matcha I have ever tasted. The first matcha I ever bought was from vita life. Although I got alot of it, it was very bitter and was a very dark green. The second kind I have had was serendipitea matcha. It was much better than vita life, but because it was culinary grade (I use matcha to cook also) it was not as Delicious as pure matcha, since this matcha is ceremonial grade. Now, as for why this tea (pure matcha) is so good, there are a few reasons. First, it dissolves well. I have drunk it in both milk and hot (but not boiling) water. Second, it is not bitter, at all. Not even a little bit. And finally, it is a very bright green matcha, which I heard is the best kind. So, if you are looking for matcha to mostly drink I strongly recommend this, even though it is pretty expensive. If you are only using it for cooking, and you use a lot, I would go with the serendepitea because you get about 4 ounces compared to the one ounce for almost the same price. Honestly, I don't recommend vita life at all. I have never had domatcha, which I hear is similar to this one, but if you don't like that one you will certainly like pure matcha."
Greenies,"My dog loves these treats.  Our vet recommended them for improved dental health, but no one carries the small size locally.  My dog is only 9 pounds, so these are great!"
Better than Mrs. Mays...,"I used to buy Mrs. May's nut crunches for my family....until I discovered they were made of Chinese grown ingredients.  They used to also put their products together in China, which I see they've changed.  But that aside, they are still sourcing their ingredients from a country that sees nothing wrong with putting melamine in milk and dog food and uses lead based paints on childrens' toys.  I tried Mareblu's Cashew Crunch a few months ago because their products are made in the U.S. of ingredients sourced in the U.S.  They're wonderful!  They are as good or better than Mrs. May's and the carbon footprint used to create these products has to be half."
Excellent Flavor,This Chai Tea has excellent flavor and I have enjoyed many Chai Teas. This one for Keurig is by far one of the best I have enjoyed over the years. Thanks.
Always fresh!,"These are the best tasting almonds. I buy them in bulk to share at work. Any time someone finds cheaper almonds, they always come back to these because they can't be beat."
Great cereal!,"Delicious ,crunchy granola that is loaded with pumpkin seeds and flax. Great mixed with yogurt and berries for a nutritious breakfast. Good buy ."
Healthy treats,"The trail mix chicken is so healthy. There are no unnecessary ingredients, and it's human grade. You can clearly tell what each piece is. My dogs love it, and I feel great about feeding it!"
"Soft, Subtle Blend","*****<br />Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea has a fragrant bouquet, and an unusual taste that comes from the blend of red tea and white tea. The red tea taste is more dominant, the white tea taste subtle. I have to say that I like the red and white blend more than the red alone. I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.<br /><br />The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I'd agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you've had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of ""potent antioxidants"", which of course is very healthy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />*****"
i agree,"i bought these for my shih-tzu and pom, the did ok with it, but they are rather flimsey, my pit bull got ahold of it and there were splinters every where, so if you have mixed dog sizes be careful of this one. Hartz has a nice big thick ribeye bone that walgreens sells for 2/$5.00 usually, these are thick enough that they do not splinter or break, and there is lots of yummy marrow in the middle that the small dogs can get to, try those."
Great Substitute,"I love this flour. I love to bake, so being on a gluten-free diet is not easy. But I use this flour for all of my baking. If the recipe has under 2 cups of flour, I usually use this flour as a straight substitution- and no one knows the difference. This has helped me make everything...cheesecakes, tortes, pies, even for breading chicken. So happy baking!"
Multi-Use Product for Great Price,"So I started using this the day I received it in the mail (fast shipping btw) and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I use this 1-2 times a day when I have a smoothie, sometimes as a little spread on my toast, and for my skin.  I have very sensitive skin (on my face and back) so I tend to use it everywhere else on my body.<br /><br />In regards to the supplement, it does in fact suppress your appetite, which will than lead to smaller portion control if you were ever to stop using this as a supplement.<br /><br />My next step would be to use it for a replacement of cooking oil but hopefully the meat won't have that taste of coconut...I love coconut but not to that extent."
Beware!!  These are addictive!!  Great Snack!!,"There is only 1 problem with these . . . Once I open a bag, it is VERY hard for me to put it away without finishing it!!  I'm not really a fan of almonds, but the cocoa almonds in the Emerald S'mores Trail Mix are even pretty good!  The last time I bought these locally, I paid $2.29 + Tax/Each at Kroger here in Columbia, TN."
Fantastic Flavor,"The flavor of my first bite was unbelievably intense.  I've tried numerous GF cookies, these are my favorite by a long shot. The package has been redesigned, it is now cream & blue in color."
Yummy,"We love peanut butter and chocolate combination. This Kind bar flavor is really good, healthy and filling. I keep a Kind bar in my desk drawer for the afternoon cravings."
"Well, at least the shipper was good","The company did a great job shipping the product, but the product itself was awful.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Ghormeh Sabzi and this was by far the worst I've ever tasted.  I tried another packaged product in the past that was pretty decent.  However, this stuff smelled awful and tasted even worse than it smelled."
great idea - but go to your local whole sale club,I love buying gum this way - but 1/3 the cost at my local wholesale club! works out to less than 1/2 the cost of buying at the store individually (around $0.65 per pack)
Seriously...now the shipping is $70 dollars?,"I love meyer lemons, but seriously.....an additional $70 dollars for shipping?  What the heck...is this delivered by a queen astride a unicorn?  Unreal!"
Best sauce,"This is some of the best BBQ sauce ever. Spicy is Spicy. The original is great also. The one called smokin' is ok, just seems so spicy it covers up the meat. Give it a try."
Best dog food,I have been buying this dog food for more than three years. It has been the best for both of my dogs. They seem to thrive since the first time they consumed it.
Best Pistachios I Have Ever Eaten,"These pistachios are the best I've ever eaten-- the perfect amount of salt, the perfect amount of roasting, easy to open-- they can't be beat!"
Great Chip!,"I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee."
Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal,Mesa Sunrise is our favorite of the Organic Nature's Path cereals. We have eaten it for several years now. I also appreciate the eco-pac bags that reduce packaging and can be re-used as waxed paper. Amazon was the best price I found as of 7/07 and the free delivery was prompt and added to the value.
Great Gluten Free Product,"This is a great tasting and handy product for those who must follow a gluten free diet. Requires no refrigeration so easy to pack, etc."
good alternative,"After having found how versatile quinoa is as a grain and because niether of us likes the whole grain pastas we've found, we began looking for a quinoa pasta.  We were very pleased to find this product in bulk online; and, although, we don't eat pasta often these days, we already are on our second carton of 12 boxes."
My puppy love them,My puppy go mad for this. He loves it and unlike Liver you don't have to worry about the quantity. If you don't know it is actually lungs.
Adds something that the competition doesn't...,"SCALP and HAIR therapy...nourishing balm.  Plenty of products like it on the market.  But this one really adds something.  It nourishes the scalp so much that its overwhelmed with nourishment and becomes dry and itchy.  So, not a great product in that aspect.<br /><br />As far as the hair nourishment - it's designed for African American hair, and it's not a big glop of goo when used appropriately.  It works to soften the hair, but no better or worse than the competition.  (But it doesn't lead to dandruff like the competition, so it hits an average 3-star.<br /><br />If you haven't had success with other hair/scalp treatments, you could give this stuff a try.  But if you're happy with what you're using, this stuff isn't going to provide anything better."
My preferred gluten-free cookies,Out of all of the gluten-free cookies that I've tried these are my favorite.  I put in a soy-based butter-alternative and add a little extra to make them very moist.<br />I'd give it more stars if the product was somehow healthier.
!!!THE BEST RAISIN BRAN EVER!!!,"I wasn't sure how I would like this cereal because of horrors from my childhood. I must say when I was growing up the other Raisin Bran was a family favorite and I could never stand it. I am on my 3rd box already and will be ordering  this over and over again. The flakes stay crispy, the raisins are plump and fresh and organic to boot. As others have noted there are loads and loads of raisins in each box. Low sodium, just enough protein and the only sugar is natural from the rasins. If I could give it 10 * I would. Highly recommended."
Better than homemade!,"I am so glad to see this item on Amazon.  It is a great item! My family loves crepes and I've been making them for years with various recipes and tweaks.  I use just a regular non-stick fry pan which works great (the secret is getting your pan pre-heated well, whatever the size or type of pan you use).  I first tried this mix about 2 years ago and have never looked back. Not only is it super convenient, the crepes have a rich/buttery/eggy flavor that I never have been able to achieve myself.  This way I make consistently delicious crepes! I have searched out this item from obscure vendors before but now Amazon will make getting it easy."
Best Dog Toy Ever!,"Best Dog Toy Ever!, March 11, 2008<br /><br />I have a Pug and a Mini-Pin who have toys strewn about every room in the house. Simply put... this toy is much in demand by both dogs and the bone part of the toy is all but chewed to pieces. They love it even without a rawhide ring screwed into it. This is the only toy I've actually made a point to search out the same toy as a  replacement. Yes, it is durable and lasts a long time."
An Unexpected DELIGHT!,"ABSOLUTELY stunning tea! It's delicious! It's the perfect, warm, hearty start to the day! It's so rich that it doesn't need ANY sweeteners or milk... it's perfect wonderful with just hot water. Also, this is an extremely good deal! Individual boxes such as these typically run around $3.50 but buying 6 of them... they come in at a whole $1 less! Bigelow needs to hire me as their brand ambassador because I have been selling this tea to everyone who I come in contact with! ha ha."
easy,Love the easy mac - so quick and just enough for a serving for my daughter
Emeril's price increase excessive,"I, too, think the 25% price increase for Big Easy Bold is out of line.  But I disagree that the increase in the commodity price of coffee can justify it.  The overall amount of coffee in k-cups is not large enough to have driven such a big increase.  My other favorite k-cups are going up ""only"" 16%.  I don't get it, and I'm not buying it... even though I enjoy the product.  I, too, cancelled my order.  So 1 star for the sticker shock!"
For the big dogs only,"This is packaged in a resealable, air tight pouch which is easy to open.  The treats are thick and quite hard.  They are scored so they can be snapped in two, with a bit of effort.<br /><br />I called my canine food testing panel, Hunter - a four year old, 65 lb Golden Retriever, and Boston - a three year old 35 lb mixed breed.  Both members of the panel were called and appeared quite interested when the treat package was opened, although it must be noted that this is their usual response to any promise of food.  Each caught the treat when it was tossed and quickly gobbled it down, then stared at the bag waiting for a second sample.  After receiving treats for two days both panel members would return from the yard immediately when the bag was shaken and they were called - high praise indeed from this pair.<br /><br /> These treats are quite hard and did require that some chewing  occur rather than their usual practice of swallowing things whole which I considered a plus as it would help clean their teeth to some extent.  I do though question as to whether a small dog or one with diseased (or missing) teeth would be able to chew these treats.  To test this I offered these treats to my cats, and although both expressed interest in them neither were able to bite into the treats.<br /><br />I liked this product, both my dogs were happy with the treats (although to be fair neither one has ever been picky).  I was impressed that the ingredients were all natural and found the packaging quite convenient to use.  For my two dogs the hardness was a plus as it did make them chew even a bit rather than gulping whole.  I do not though think that this would be a good product to give a very young puppy, a small dog or one who had any dental problems as I do not think these animals would be able to safely break up the treats."
Pleased,"I ordered this tea because I like to drink and try many different types of teas.  I'm not too sure about its weight loss properties (I've only started to drink it), but the taste is very pleasant.  I drink the tea w/o sugar because I like to enjoy the taste of the tea itself.  This product taste good both hot and cold.  I think it is worth giving it a try."
The best!!! Allows you to make tea just as good as Starbucks!,"I have been a huge iced tea fan my whole life and a Venti Passion Iced Tea sweetened is my absolute favorite drink at Starbucks. While the iced tea is pretty cheap option at Starbucks, by buying this, I am able to recreate my favorite drink at home.<br /><br />I tie together 4 tea bags, add it to 2 qts of water and refrigerate it a couple of hours Then I add in about a cup of sugar syrup (made by boiling 1 cup sugar/1 cup water and letting it cool). Sometimes I flavor the sugar syrup with a little vanilla extract when I remember, otherwise it's still good.  Voila, passion ice tea! Add a little lemon juice for an extra kick. Alternatively you could add lemonade like they do at Starbucks as well.<br /><br />Enjoy."
Real coffee,"This is some of the real stuff... rich full flavor, not bitter just full body, dark and rich.In the same park as French Roast"
EEEWWWW,"These flavors are so realistic! The rotten egg and sprout flavors almost made me vomit! now when i think of the rotten egg, i feel dizzy. The cake, roasted marshmallow, and cherry ones are SO good though! i would recomand this to anyone!<br />P.S. try the black ones!"
Tasty but too high in calories,"To begin, I definitely think that the taste of Planters Big Nut Triple Nut Bars is very good.  I like roasted nuts and these are very nutty.  The dominant taste is that of peanuts, but as we know, Planters is known for their nuts.<br /><br />The label states that these ""big bars"" are 30% larger and therein lies the problem, from my perspective.  They are also 30% higher in calories.  Also, because of the larger size, there are only 5 bars per box versus the usual 5.<br /><br />I would much prefer that they reduce the size by 30% and give me 6 nut bars per box.  This would cut the caloric content from 220 down to about 150 calories per bar, lessening the guilt factor and giving one an extra bar to enjoy.<br /><br />So the product itself is pretty good, but I think that the portion is too large."
Stash brand teas: A personal favorite for 10+ years,"If you enjoy Earl Grey tea, once you try ""double bergamot"" you will be a customer for the rest of your life. Personally, I ""brew"" the tea using the following method:<br /><br />1. Fill cup with water, leaving enough room for milk and sugar after brewing (if you use those items).<br /><br />2. Put the bag in the cold water cup and microwave for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />3. Remove from microwave and allow to steep another minute.<br /><br />4. Remove bag, add sugar & milk.<br /><br />Enjoy"
Dogs love these,"My dogs loved these treats, but they are little expensive for no more than they give you."
Better than Starbuck's,"Well, better than Starbuck's K-cups.  And at a much better price.  The Tully's French Roast is by far the tastiest of the K-Cup French roasts."
"Yum, but expensive.","Delicious popcorn assortment.<br />We bought our first batch from a cup scout and thought it was great. Had to have more. So ordered here and loved it but cheez, costly with shipping.<br />Sent some to my folks for xmas and they loved it too."
""" chicory ""..?",I just bought 2 jars of the Leroux chicory ..as above...<br /><br />Years ago I drove thu  Louisiana  and noticed the coffee tasted  different...chicory...so I know what chicory tastes like.<br /><br />this product is not chicory.....it looks and tastes like the PERO  product..which i already have..did not want more of it..<br /><br />Ed .......e....bjerk@cox.net<br />I need to change my opinion..just bought some ground chicory and  it tasted about the same..very good ..perhaps I  am remembering the chicory flavor from many years ago as much stonger than  it really is..I must appologize for my initial opinion.<br />Ed
Love It!!,"Great product, it was exactly what I wanted.  I ordered the medium size because my shi tzu LOVES greenies so much! Good deal for the price considered how expensive they are at petco!!"
good stuff,"this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks"
MASDTIC GUM IS DELICIOUS,"This gum has a unique flavor, you either like it, or despise it. I happen to love it. It is sold locally at middle eastern markets, for under two bucks a box! The gum is a little bit hard to chew at first, a bit tough if you will. Very sugary taste, highly recommend."
Excellent when you are really hungry! :),"I would like to stress, when you are REALLY hungry, these Chow Mein Noodles are a blessing! They really are darn good for a less than a dollar processed instant food, and they are easy to fix!<br /><br />I use these on the road as a truck driver when I get to the end of my shift and all restaurants are closed (2 or 3 am!), and usually add a packet of crushed red pepper left over from a previous pizza feeding. I think I should carry a can of oysters to chop up and add to this dish, that just might make it even better!<br /><br />The arrows or ""fill line"" is really hard to see, but is there. I made the mistake of adding a little above it once, and ended up with excess water/juice in my meal. I guess I didn't think the packet of sauce added that much more moisture, but once I just added water to the fill line, and let it sit for 5 minutes after the cooking time, all was better! :)"
They should not have added sugar in it,"I got this oatmeal as a present. Add hot water and microwave it for 30 seconds and it's ready to serve. I like the texture and taste, but they should not have added the 9g of sugar. Total carb per bag is 38g, and that's high for someone like me who can't eat more than 2 servings (30g) of carb at breakfast."
Smart Bones? What bones?  Gobbled em' down!,"Seller had the product out and to us very fast, TY.  The only thing wrong with the product was there wasn't enough to last!!  My Goldens ate them up in a couple of bites:0) Better buy a bunch!!!"
Satisfied,Our new puppy is thriving.  She gets three small helpings a day and seems satified. I think the blend of ingredients works well and the size is perfect for a puppy.
Best Popcorn Ever,"This was the sweetest, smallest, hulless, best tasting white popcorn I have ever had.  Just placed an additional order for a 6 lb. bag as well as other varities carried by this company."
Great Hot Cocoa!,We had previously tried another brand of hot coca k-cups. We bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value. We actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried. They have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness. We like the variety of flavors in the pack also.
NOT FOR STRONG CHEWERS!,These bones splinter extremely easily for Medium to Large Dogs!  I would only give them to Toy or small dogs and with careful supervision.
Great product!,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
YUM!,These are very good. The apple flavor is spot on. I also bought Cherry which is less flavorful but still nice. I love that they are not full of artifical colors. No nasty coloring aftertastes from these candies. My husband is crazy about the apple.
Yummy chips!,"My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring. This is one of those we like best from their stable of goodies.<br /><br />I went to graduate school in Buffalo, lived in Western New York for years, and frequented the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were invented. So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!<br /><br />And these are tasty indeed. I would prefer a bit more of the bite/heat of a Buffalo chicken wing, but that is not a serious issue. I find it amazing that this product can even hint at the pleasures of Buffalo chicken wings!"
Great snack!,"We found this product while on vacation in South Carolina. Once we got home, we found it wasn't available in our town so, I went to Amazon.com and sure enough, there it was! It's a wonderful snack that 'grows on you' the more you eat. We were so pleased that once we ordered it, it arrived within 48 hours! Great service and cheaper than making a 45 mile drive, one way, to get it."
Fantastic Ketchup!,"I've always been a ketchup fanatic... putting it on practically everything. However, I never enjoyed the taste of Hunts, Heinz, and a few other large name brands. There were a few local smaller brands that I've purchased in the past that I can no longer find... so I've made due with the ""whatever is on sale"" approach lately.<br /><br />My ketchup addictions aside, I've been trying to eat more ""healthy"" in the past year or so. I was randomly searching across products on Amazon and stumbled onto Annie's. I was very skeptic to try a brand I knew nothing about, especially when it claimed to be ""natural"" or ""organic""... but I convinced myself to give it a shot. I'm VERY glad I did. This ketchup has the best flavor of any I have tried to date! I will definitely be a future customer... no doubt about it."
Tasty and better on sodium,I got these because the 100 calorie packs are helpful for portion control.  And lately I have been trying to watch my sodium and these pretzels are some of the lowest that they carry at my grocery store.  Great product.
"So good, so fresh","This is the best tasting sparkling fruit juice I have ever had.  Since it has no added sugar, it's refreshing, not sticky sweet.  The bubbles are just enough to give it a little zing.  I can see drinking this in place of wine or cocktails with snacks before dinner, or even with dinner, because the black cherry is a flavor that goes well with many types of food."
Rotten?,"OUr first order came and it was pate, which is not what i was expecting. Some can's has fungus in them? Weird. I got my second pack and they were fine."
Very mild and tasty,I love this coffee. My favorite. K cups from Green Mountain have a small chance of blowing a huge amount of grounds into your cup. Still buy it though.
Check Prices,"We had been using Similac Soy formula, but found that to be giving our baby serious constipation, so we switched brands and landed on Good Start. We have had no issues with this formula. I am mainly going to comment on price... this product sells at Walmart for 21.00 per 25.7oz container (considerably less than the price on Amazon). Just a FYI."
"Garden of Eatin' Tortilla Chips, Blue, No Salt Added, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)","This is a good product, BUT, buy the larger bags.  They are the better value.  These are excellent for anyone who must limit their salt intake."
Awesome sauce,"This is my favorite hot sauce.  It has enough sweetness to balance the pleasant heat.  It is absolutely delicious on everything, especially on chinese food or any kind of pork.  I highly recommend this sauce.  $11.50 for two bottles is a little steep though, you can find it cheaper elsewhere."
Anxious kitty - major improvement,"I adopted a third cat a few months ago.  I had 2 females so decided a male would be the best addition and I had fallen in love with Bam Bam at the adoption center.  Day one, he howled all night long.  I thought it might take a few days for him to adjust but NO!  It took months, every morning between 3 and 4 he would start howling again.  I finally decided to try Pet Rescue Remedy. I'm putting at least a couple of drops in all bowls of food so no matter who eats it, they all get Rescue Remedy.  It's been about 2 weeks and he's now much quieter and in fact I haven't had to boot him out of the room.  He is still using my other cats tail as his toy but I'll work on that next.  Fantastic product even though it's more expensive than gold."
TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce,"TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce.<br />The best Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce available for my teats on the market<br />just the right amount of heat. I add it to soups,eggs,beans,and just about anything else to give it an extra boost of heat & flavor. Shipping was fast."
Nice new treat,"Our dog likes the sweet potato treats as a close 2nd to the duck sausage...and they take her a while to chew and eat, so they are good for a different item to have..."
Best coffee I have found!,I have been using this coffee for about 3 years now and I am totally pleased. There are other high-priced brands of Columbian Supremo that don't tastes any better.  This is a great deal.
Healthy Feline Cuisine For Your Finicky Cat(s),"Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called ""potentially harmful"" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim ""Natural"" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that ""Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats.""  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says ""Product of Thailand"", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is ""people food for cats.""  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal."
"Best gluten free pretzels, best price","Our son has celiac but our entire family prefers these to regular pretzels - my father in law, too. Fortunately, I can buy a case on line and use subscribe and save. It's about $2.50 a bag cheaper than buying locally."
For My Guests.,"I first saw Mexican Coca-Cola at my local warehouse store. What is this, I wondered? Then I read an article about it and the story about how American Coke had been gradually changed and no longer was made with cane sugar. It seems that the U.S. Coke is made with corn syrup. Mexican Coke was said to be like the old-fashioned American Coke I knew and loved as a kid, so it seems. Actually, I preferred Pepsi and you got twice as much for your dime. Well, I just had to try Mexican Coke and I bought a case. It's quite delicious, and is indeed better than the Coca-Cola generally purchased in the U.S. I suppose you could say that it's gourmet Coca-Cola.<br /><br />In any case, I seldom drink anything except diet soft drinks because of a calorie problem I have. However, I have friends, relatives and guests that won't drink diet drinks. So, I always have a few bottles of Mexican Coke in the fridge. I offer it with a slight explanation and people seem to love it. They're almost always amazed. The novelty is worth the extra price.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
Love @ 1st. sip,"My children and I attended a ""tea"" at a local museum this spring.  Stash Jasmine Blossom Tea was served and my 17, 9 year old and myself were blown away!  The taste was amazing.  I've hunted every deli & market in my area to no avail.  No one sells it near me, so I ordered it in bulk because I love it so much."
Walden Farms Mayo,"I was skeptical about the Walden Farms products. No Sugar, No Carbs, No Fat?? I couldn't have imagined any good taste from from all the ""No's"" listed.  After using several of their products I have to admit they are well worth the price without sacrificing the taste. I really enjoy the mayo on a lettuce wrap for a snack or lunch. Wow! It's healthy for you."
Great for training,Both my dogs love these and they are the perfect size for training.  Amazon has the best price on the 1 lb. bag.
Not bad but not great.,I was really excited about this tea but I think I fell for the attractive box. It just doesn't do much for me. It's not the worst thing I've had but it's not that great either. I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe try Tulsi or Yogi tea instead.
great bars,"These bars are great as is your company. I love to get these bars, they are good to have when you just want a little something sweet, not too many cals."
Great tea,"This tea is easy to brew, doesn't have any bitter aftertaste, and is sweet without being overly so or needing extra sugar or honey added.  Smells great in the package as well."
"same as always, great kit kat","These kit kats are great, they are the same as the regular ones but just orange colored. I will be passing these out to trick or treaters."
Cereal,"This cereal is the best of the bunch of grain cereals of those I've tried, so I buy a lot of it.  It's not at all unusual for me to eat this cereal three times a day, along with other nutritious food.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, I am not allowed to purchase as much as I wish so I have to make frequent smaller purchases.<br /><br />I almost always have it in the morning, limited only by running out of milk; although I occasionally eat it without milk.  I add a healthy sprinkle of cinnamon and water at a 3:1 (water:cereal) ratio, zap it on high for 90 seconds, let it sit for as long as it takes to finish my coffee while I read a few chapters from the Bible, and then finish with another 60 seconds to reach my preferred consistency and temperature.  To this I immediately add a very generous cup of walnuts and then cover with milk.  Pecans are better than walnuts when you can find good pecans, but that's a rarity here in North Carolina.  The very best pecans are grown in or near Hoover, Alabama by local folks and sold to local folks and not generally available elsewhere.  Eating a bowl of this cereal with a generous helping of Alabama pecans can make you feel like a very special and privileged person."
candy,"i picked wrong candy by accident, but i liked it.<br /><br />this is little chewy like a caramel,<br />i wouldn't recommend if anyone doesn't want caramel like candy."
Grain Beetles - Litter INFESTED,"I've been using SWheat Scoop for almost year and thought great product..until I started noticing tiny black bugs infesting flooring around the litter box. Took a while to realize bugs connected to the Swheat Scoop. I tried removing the BOX and keeping litter in air tight container but found More Bugs.  So I examined the litter and its well, Littered w/ tiny BUGS. This isn't one box..its several months of boxes.<br /><br />I am alerting the pet store but likely the Litter is infected. You wouldn't notice these bugs unless sweep them onto white background. Gross...switching litter immediately (have no idea to what). good luck."
great product,"This is a great product and is just the same as the Thai iced tea in restaurants.  It took me a while to find this product, but once I found it, I've stuck with it."
Nutty but good...,"I know that a lot of people are starting to think that any product with fiber is better than the same product without. This (along with a discount from Amazon.com) was one of the reasons I purchased the Davinci Whole Wheat pasta. I had never tried whole wheat pasta before, so I didn't know what was ""good.""<br /><br />It's not bad. Cooks well. Has a bit of a nutty flavor, but this doesn't overwhelm the spaghetti sauce. If the kids aren't ready for brown pasta, it can be mixed with normal angel hair pasta--just beware that whole wheat takes longer to cook, so you will have to prepare both pastas separately.<br /><br />Also, there are 12 boxes in the package--so if you don't know if you are going to like you may want to buy an individual box at the store first!"
Tips are great,I think PG tips are my favorite black tea. Its such a delicious tea. No wonder its Englands number one brand.
Not worth it,"Not very good. Powdery tea, little taste, little smell. Doesn't come close when compared to other loose leaf Ceylon brands."
great,They are so good i eat the whole bag in an hour LOL i don't know if that's a good thing ... oh well
Very good,These chocolates are so very good. Smooth and creamy. I am giving them as wedding favors..
Good rice blend,This is a nice blend of rice.  My family eats rice everyday as one of our primary grains and I try to use as many different varieties as I can so it doesn't get boring.
"Great product, sloppy service","The pepperoni is fantastic, as usual.  Amazon was not. While I cancelled the order on my end (it was a duplicate of my son's), they didn't acknowledge it although I got an e-mail confirming the cancellation.  Because it was ""food"" there are no returns.  Looks like 2 bags every 3 months instead of one."
great.not dangerous,"how can u say its not safe??????its great because they are hard,my son chews on them,they melt,yeah messy but...u put a bib on .it works for us"
Morning Coffee,Great coffee at a good price. I'm a subscription buyer and I buy this month after month. What more can I say?
Guinea pig food,This organic protein tastes so bad that I think its meant for you to not want to eat ever again... but I guess it's good for you?
Just like always,"great, taste like always and is as good as ever.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nice, wonderful, awesome. Fantastic, fun, wow!<br />  Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?<br />  How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it."
My cats love it.,"Great cat food, both mine love this stuff. It also has less carbs than most other cat foods, as all the Friskies pate varieties do."
needs marketing change,As an aid to tranquility and sleep -- what it is marketed for -- it is not very effective.  But for chronic severe constipation it is the only thing that has worked for me.
Great Greenie alternative!,"We have a 3 year old Maltese that we used to shower with Greenies (1-2 a day) even though it says to limit them to one per day.  The last time we took him to the vet, we told her what kind of food he's on and what kind of treats he gets.  She was concerned with the amount of Greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day.  She said that Greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life.  So I searched on Amazon for a wheat free dental chew...<br /><br />Our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews (including this one) and likes them all.  He's tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8"">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18"">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>.<br /><br />After reading mixed reviews, I decided to give these a try.  My first impressions were that these were pretty large for a ""small"" dog.  They are twice the length of a Greenie.  When our little guy got one, he ate half of it, then tried to hide the other half.  He did like it though.  I will say that he usually devours his Greenies but he takes his time on these (he did the same with the Zukes at first).  After a few days, he seems to really like them.<br /><br />If you're doing a side by side comparison between the Get Naked dental chew, Greenies and Zukes,  I think these are better.  They're really low in calories and they're wheat free, corn free, soy free and gluten free.  They're cheaper than Zukes as well.<br /><br />My recommendation is to cut them in half.  That will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag.  Three bags will give you 108 treats vs. Greenies 96 at around the same price.  He likes the Zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag.<br /><br />I suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them.  If they do, then they are a great alternative to Greenies."
Slight bitterness,I Love All BOLD strong coffees.  I thought I'd try this one.  It had a slight Bitter taste to me. Not my favorite. Wish the variety Bold pack wasn't so much $$$!!  I Love that one!
"Price varies a lot, so be sure to comparison shop!","I love this coconut water -- it's naturally sweet and has nice little bits of coconut in the water (but not too much). My only ""complaint"" is that I bought a pack of 12 for about $22-23 on Amazon a few months ago, signing up for the regular delivery. Now, it is listed as ""not available"" for the regular delivery, but in fact Amazon sells the SAME product for $38 (also a 12-pack, same brand, same size per can). It's a bit unfair to lure in innocent people and then as soon as you get addicted to this fantastic coconut water (and I count myself there!) you suffer some serious sticker shock."
"""Golden Fresh Cookie Fingers""","""Golden Fresh Cookie Fingers""<br />  Are so good the only problem is the Cookie Package size is not large enough, not when four or five little pairs of hands are grabbing for the Golden Fingers.<br /><br />PS; Little Hands are from Grandchildren when Vienna Fingers are in snack cabinet, that is everyone's first choice! The bag is empty til I reach in for one, that's okay I love watching the grandchildren eating their cookie fingers.<br /><br />Pop [captcrunch75]"
pretty good but not the best,"being raised in germany, i always had the great marzipan. when i got this box it actually did taste pretty good but it was somewhat dry, though i think the toasting is the cause of that. it didnt have an intense flavor and was more sweet than almondy, another reason it wasnt my favorite. i love marzipan but i cant afford the real expensive stuff so i buy this stuff and its delicious either way, since i rarely get to try it.<br />shipping was on time and it was fresh. so all in all i rate this four, for the good service, and the good tasting candy.<br />warning- it was smaller than i expected."
"The freshness seal doesn't ""lock"", it's flawed","I've been feeding my cats science diet for probably 3-4 years and the one thing they've had in common over time is that the reseal freshness ""lock"" seems to always be flawed in some way. I've used this sealing technology on lots of food and non-food containers for probably 20 years so I think the common denominator here is Science Diet. Someone at Science Diet probably needs to look at the QA results for their bags and figure out how to create a working ""lock"" that seals.<br /><br />I've resorted to just pouring the contents out into a large jug and feeding Sassy and Hoshi from there."
Tasty alternative to soda,"This was pretty yummy.  I don't like pop (or soda for you Easterners) but I do occasionally crave a carbonated beverage that isn't too sugary.  This fits the bill.  It's light and refreshing.  (I know, ""light and refreshing"" are overused words when it comes to describing drinks, but it's true, I swear!"
not good...,"I bought it expecting it to taste like watered down Capri Sun, it tastes more like Capri sun with an extra 16 packs of nasty aftertaste fake sugar.<br /><br />Wouldn't drink it again if it were free..."
Indo Noodles,"I first became addicted to Mi Goreng in university. Attracted initially by the cheapness of the product - which appealed to my frequently empty wallet. Soon after I was hooked. Even now as an employed person with a steady income, I still enjoy these noodles. They take me back to a simpler time when furniture was sourced from the side of the road and washed clothes was a luxury.<br /><br />High quality noodles with a great, complex flavour and just the right amount of MSG. Great for quick snacks, or as an additive to stir frys.<br /><br />Note: there is no egg inside the bag - no matter how hard you look."
Very good value - but manufacturer should switch to a larger bulk bag,"This was an Excellent value of buying on Amazon versus the pet stores.<br />It was packaged and labeled well for shipment.<br /><br />However - the manufacturer's plastic top of the box itself is a little cheap and less functional than I expected.  Frankly, the whole top has to come off each time I want to give my dog a single chew.<br /><br />So - I'm actually putting these chews into a Dog treat jar that has a open-and-close top with a tab.<br /><br />The manufacturer could simply change the bulk packaging to a bag.  Frankly, a Ziploc bag would be just as functional (and probably have a lower manufacturing cost) than the box."
Delicious coffee,I love the taste of this coffee. My husband says its the best coffee he has ever had. I save alot of money on cream because the cream is right in it. Yummy!
"Not strong enough of  a Tea flavor, mostly smells good",I usually drink Twinnings earl grey.  I opted to try something new and i love bergamont so i figured DOUBLE BERGAMONT would be amazing. Well this tea smells amazing but it is very very weak. I have to use 2 teabags vs 1 twinnings tea bag and seep it for 7+ min in order to get the equal flavor i would get from twinnings. I wish this tea was stronger in flavor not just in smell.
PopChips are the best!,"As a Weight Watcher, PopChips really satisfy that need for chips with a sandwich for low points and good taste.  I also love the single serve bags for portion control."
The feel good workout drink,"I have grown to love Achiva. I was really sick of the chemically sugar drinks that are currently on the market. It is my goal to eat real food in my everyday life. The current offerings of sports drink are the exact opposite. Too much refined sugar, artificial sweeteners and coloring.<br /><br />I started using Achiva as a convenience. It was easier and cheaper than buying Chia plus coconut water. The drink is amazing and I always feel better when I drink the mix before a run or workout. I may not win my next race or set records but I can feel good about what I put into my body to fuel my daily workout."
My favorites,"These are my favorite dried apricota and when my nearby grocery stores no longer carried them, I just knew that Amazon would not let me down; and of couse, they didn.t! Now I have a good supply that should last a good long time in my fridge."
lavazza pods,better than i was hoping for  coffee had smooth taste and the price is unbeatable.
Questionable........,"I bought Richard's Organics Pet Calm for our Yorkie to calm her down when we travel. My husband and I are long haul truck drivers and at first our youngest Yorkie was okay traveling over the road. However, when we travel over rough roads (and there are a lot of rough roads out there) she starts to pant and shake. She will take Richard's Organics Pet Calm readily enough (it has a sweet taste to it) and does get that ""sleepy eyed"" look, but I didn't see enough of a calming reaction to justify buying it again. However, I haven't tried it under ""normal"" stress circumstances, such as at home during a thunderstorm. I think that for milder stress situations, that Richard's Organics Pet Calm might work."
Cat food for a picky elderly cat,My picky 17 year old kitty loooves this product. Her brother enjoyed the gravy even when he would not eat the food anymore.<br />I love  the packaging: I don't get injured by abrading my hands on the  edge of a can.
Best dog food ever,"We have a lab mix, now 12 years old and doing amazingly well on Wellness Senior. We had a scary experience with another ""natural"" dog food. After using it for over a year this other brand suddenly made our dog very ill. We did not figure it out right away as he is a lab and will eat ANYTHING. Usually once or twice a year he gets into something that make him ill for a few days. Last time, we did our usual routine of rice and chicken stock. He got better, put him back on the other food, and he got worse again. After another cycle like that, we realized it must be the other food. So we went down tot he local pet shop looking for something better. They recommended Wellness and we have never looked back. After only a week or so on Wellness, Bear's coat got was noticeably more lustrous. Now, almost two years later we still are amazed by this food. I love the fact that it does not even smell like ""dog food"". The ingredients list is totally free of the usual gunk that is in most food. Yeah it is a bit more expensive, but totally worth it. Even his stool does not smell!"
tastes great,"This tastes great on bar-b-qued food; it adds more bar-b-que taste. It is absolutely fabulous on grilled salmon. In winter, I use a cast iron skillet for the salmon and it adds a great outdoor taste to it."
Great Flavor,"I recently discovered Popchips and their greatness. So I have been trying them out flavor by flavor. The Chili Lime has is now my favorite. It had previously been the Salt & Pepper. It is def not too spicy, so don't let that scare you. If anything the lime is the highest note of flavor. If you already like Popchips, this is a new great flavor to try. If you have never tried them, then this is a great flavor to start with."
senso coffee cheaper anywhere else,"you can buy the senso coffee cheaper anywhere else, walmart, target, grocery store, etc. but the coffee maker is a good buy at $19.95"
Still undecided,"These candies have a good taste and they seem to be made from natural ingredients which is nice but they had a slightly stale texture, sort of chewy.  I bought them for the office and had several people taste them and agree. They are supposed to have a soft middle so maybe the chewiness was by design. Unfortunately you have to buy six bags at a time so you can't find this out without making a bit of a commitment."
Not too bad... But not too good.,"It could be worse. The pineapple, which is not well-advertised on the package, is actually the best part. The worst part is the large discs of... Turnip? I'm not even sure. Sauce is bland. Pass it up, go with the BBQ chicken or zesty marinara."
great price,I brought this because it was on sale but my dogs love this stuff very fresh and moist will order again when on sale:)
Worst snack I ever tasted!,"These are definitely the worst snack I have ever purchased in my life.  Dry as the Sahara Desert, not much taste, and way overpriced.  Save your hard-earned money for something else."
The Kiwi is a bit overpowering.,"This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. The Kiwi can be a bit overpowering.  So only get this if you really like Kiwis."
My cats love this food,"One of my cats has a sensative stomach, I bought this cat food and all three of my cats love it. It has stopped my cat from throwing up the cat food with food coloring in store bought cat food. I bought all 4 flavors. They all love it. Their coats coats have become very shiney. I am impressed."
Dead Tree,"Shipping was not the problem; the tree came nicely packaged. However, it was dead to begin with. The leaves were brown. Over the next couple of weeks, I watered the tree consistently, hoping I could revive it. The only thing that I was successfully growing in that pot was moss. The tree continued to look worse and worse. I'm positive that I didn't do anything wrong. I watered it every day, made sure it was getting plenty of sunlight, and even misted the leaves. I want either a new, LIVING tree, or my money back."
Delicious!!,"I love Old Bay seasoning! I use them in fries, chicken, crabs, and shrimps. Bought it without any mistake. Got it as expected. Don't listen to negative reviews that say too spicy! it's delicious even though it's spicy. Buy it!"
Great product,"Have a very very picky food and drink child, and that includes freeze pops, I needed to find something with electrolytes, so took a chance on these, though they are a little pricey, He actually liked and ate them, so it is worth it. I will continue to buy them."
HIt @ 90th birthday party,Hi these were put in gift bags for 90th birthday party. Took all back in time! Very hard to find these dispensers in stores locally. All arrived in perfect condition.
I LOVE it...,"I recently tried this cereal for the first time... and I LOVE IT! I will continue purchasing it, but at Trader Joe's!!! They have 24 oz boxes for $3.99...."
Awesome Sour Candy!,A friend of mine from Japan first gave me one of these. It's so much fun giving them out and watching people's faces. I had one person spit it out on the floor.(didn't give another one to this person) They are the best sour lemon drops.Better even than Altoids!Buy some!Now i know where to buy them.
Awesome Tea!,"I have been drinking this rooibos for about a year now and I love it. The smell is purely amazing, reminds me of when my parents would open the coffee can in the morning and I'd butt in and say ""Hey let me smell it!"", I catch myself doing that with this tea. I use to work in the grocery business and really payed attention to prices. On average 1 can of this rooibos runs for about $12.00 at your local grocer, on Amazon its $16.99 for 2 cans... Do the math, this is a steal! I have ventured into other tea brands like shopping at overpriced Teavana and getting prettty darn good rooibos. Yet, I still find myself coming back to the rishi, can't beat the blueberry or the jamaica red bush. Also, I have never had a problem with it being to overwhelmingly tart. If it's too tart, brew less."
"Definitely ""light""","I actually thought I was buying the Van Houtte vanilla coffee k-cups that I usually purchase and I overlooked the description of ""light."" It certainly is. You can barely taste the vanilla. It's good coffee, but if you're looking for a real vanilla flavor, go with the Van Houtte k-cups that are in a darker yellow package."
"Not Pasta, But Not bad!","It definitely helps to try these out not expecting a perfect pasta replacement. These are way more like the noodles you find in instant cup soups. And yes they did have an odor when first opened, but nothing terrible, and it was gone after a few min. of washing them in cold water.<br /><br />Some have said they can't work as a substitute in spaghetti, and maybe that's true if you're expecting an exact replica for a flour based pasta spaghetti dish, but I did try it, and I was happy with the results. I followed the advice of rinsing them then patting them dry, I did 2 packages of them at once. While that was going on, I was boiling water. I am a stickler for calorie counting and portion control nowadays, so I pre-measure and freeze most of what I eat. I had a measured portion of low cal. spaghetti sauce in a ziplock bag I was heating up in the water, but put it in too soon, as the bag broke and I ended up with spaghetti sauced water. So I made use of the accident to flavor the noodles. I boiled some pearl onions in the spaghetti sauced water, then added the noodles. Let that all cook for about 7min then heated up a second pouch of spaghetti sauce. I strained the noodles, put them in a bowl with the onions and now heated sauce and added some diced tomatoes and a couple shots of hot sauce. I wanted the tomatoes to cook a bit so I further nuked the lot for a few min in the microwave. Then topped it with a slice of fat free american cheese. It was actually pretty good. The noodles were on the chewy side, but not in a bad way. And they do soak up whatever you flavor them with. So as long as that part is good, the whole dish should be good. I think with these noodles anything spicy will work best. Which is why I added the hot sauce, something I wouldn't do with reg. pasta. I'll probably try a hot asian dish next.<br />But it's really nice to know I can eat twice the amount of the low cal/carb pasta I have been using which was 175cal a serving, and actually cut the calories of the dish down to basically just the 40cal in the sauce and 25 cal in the cheese!!!"
Simply the best,This coffee is simply the best tasting coffee. It has a great flavor and can't stop drinking it LOVE IT
"For me, too bitter, prefer richer tasting blend","I prefer my hazelnut with a richer, fuller taster, which Gloria Jean's did not seem to have at all."
Dried Garbanzo Beans from Washington state,Hesitantly I purchased these dried beans but they turned out to be wonderful. Soak over night and they are ready for your recipes in the morning. I made hummus with these beans and some Sesame King Tahini... it was WONDERFUL. I made several batches and added different flavorings. Serve with fresh vegetables and so good for you!
Hexane in organic formula!,"I am very mad at myself for not doing better research before selecting formula once my breast milk supply dwindled.  Do your own search!  The Obama Admin has said that organic formula should no longer be allowed to be marketed if it contains dha/ara made with hexane.  Organic foods for adults are not allowed to be labeled as organic if they are made with  hexane.  There are several articles out there discussing possible side effects including autism and ADHD from hexane.  I am switching to Baby's Only which is the only organic formula that contains Dha/ara not manufactured using hexane.  It says it is a toddler formula which is why I didn't consider using it to begin with.  Do your own research, supposedly they market it that way to support breastfeeding exclusively for the first year.  It meets. The infant Formula requirements.  I am hoping to return the box of Earth's Best hexane formula I paid so much for thinking I was doing something good for my son.  Red the review here that copies the response from Baby's Only about it being suitable for infants  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009DXVP4"">Babys Only Organic Dairy Formula Case (6 cans)</a>."
Not what I was expecting,"This dog food is not at all what I expected. The ""meat"" in it is some type of processed spongy looking pale colored blob. My dog would not eat this and I can't say I blame her. It does not have anything in it that remotely resembles salmon. It smells awful too. A waste of money."
Good price good service,Like this taco seasoning and friend in restaurant business recomends it and the price is better than stores if you can find it.
It is toooo sweet!,"The reason I purchased this product is for the ""No Sugar Added"" clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink, it felt  too sweet and had an after taste. The taste of an artificial sweetener. After checking the ingredients, I noticed it contains ""Sucralose"". According to Wikipedia, Sucralose is 600 sweeter than table sugar! What's the point of buying something that has no sugar added but adding something that's tons of times sweeter? I am not going after the calorie factor. So does Nesquick add 600 times less amount of Sucralose than sugar to get the same sweetness? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another major problem is that Amazon's ingredients section does NOT mention Sucralose. It mentions Aspartame which, according to Wikipedia, it's 100-150 times sweeter than sugar, which means much less sweeter than Sucralose. So did Nesquick change their ingredients and Amazon did not update their ingredients list?"
Just Right for Me,"I recently found this blend available at my local Walmart (sorry Amazon, but it had a great price). It is a light blend such as I prefer, and tastes wonderful.  I could not detect any aftertaste as you get with medium or dark coffee blends. I previously wrote a review for Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend which I recommended to those that prefer medium blends.  However, this particular blend is just right for me.  I highly recommend this blend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer light blends."
My dog's best friend!!!,"These bones are amazing and my dogs love them. I have two vigorous chewers so these bones are a much better option than regular rawhides or other treats. They are much more expensive at retailers though, so I love being able to save some money by purchasing them online."
Has mostly cleared up our vomiting problem,"My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.  The vet said there was nothing wrong and she was probably just eating too fast.  We immediately switched over to this Sensitive Stomach version and the vomiting frequency decreased dramatically.  Now she vomits only once every two or three months.  I'm skeptical that there is anything really different about this food, and it could have just been a coincidence that she stopped vomiting after we switched.  Still, I'd rather just stick with this kind than find out.  I took away one star because it is, in my opinion, unreasonably expensive."
Great GF Pretzels,"I find so little GF products that I really love. I do without rather than suffer the flavor.  This is, to the best of my memory, as good as Snyders.  This does not taste GF at all!!!"
Great Gravy,"This product is great!  I add it to almost everything, flavor is wonderful.  The container was smaller than I expected..didn't know what 170g meant,size wise.  Its from Europe and will be a great additon to any sauce you make."
over priced,Over priced for what you can get from the manufacturer directly and also have a much larger selection of different coffees - as well as the new chocolate flavor - do not understand why anyone would buy USED coffee - by its nature coffee cannot be USED
"Good flavor, surprisingly chunky","This was much chunkier than I expected.  Our baby still can't handle lumpy food, so he wouldn't eat it at first.  But after I pureed it smooth, he loved it."
weak,"I had tried Green Mountain Sumatra Reserve and found it delicious and strong. It's not available on ""subscribe and save"" so I read the reviews and opted for Wolfgang Puck. My husband likes it and I like the flavour but it's very weak in comparison to the Green Mountain. I have to order something else for me."
Ms. Bea loves her FF Classic Chicken Feast,"My older kitty, Ms. Bea can only eat soft food now, and she especially likes FF Classic Chicken.  I like the price!"
Love this tea -- and I don't even like tea!,"I LOVE INEEKA PEPPERMINT TEA!!!  It's made from peppermint leaves, not from tea leave, so the taste is soft, minty, and clean.  Excellent for upset stomach, sore throat, or just to warm up or cleanse the palette.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!"
"As far as diet foods go, it's definitely 5 star!","We received a sampler package from Amazon that had several flavors....cheddar, bbq, sour cream/onion, plain, salt and pepper, and also the salt and vinegar.<br /><br />I've already received our first shipment of just the vinegar version.  These are a good salty fix without the calories...and each proportioned pouch is satisfying in one sitting.  I would've liked to try the garlic parm but it wasn't included.<br /><br />Our #1 is salt and vinegar and #2 would probably be the salt and pepper."
My dog loves it!,"I have a 3 year old Boston Terrier who is not only a picky eater, but most dog foods give him bad gas.  I searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that, while not organic, helped relieve the gas problem.<br />After finishing a bag of the old brand, I stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought I'd take a chance and see if he'd like it or not.  I'm happy to report that he loves it AND it doesn't give him horrible gas at all.  His coat is shiny and healthy, as well.  The only downside I can see--like the other brand--is the price.  But being that the product is high quality and organic, I can't argue that too much.  Plus, with amazon's subscribe and save, I get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door.  You definitely can't beat that!<br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase."
great coffee,Gloria Jeans has a great product of Hazelnut flavored coffee.  The product is liked by all my colleagues.  The transaction via Amazon was prompt and efficient.  Will buy again from Amazon.
Fantastic!,"In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, I love Milo for it's good mix of chocolate and malt, not too much of either, and a great comfort drink for cold nights."
Delicious!!,"I first found these chips at Ocean State Job Lot and just had to have more but they don't stock them anymore.  They are super delicious with a good amount of cracked black pepper which I love!<br />Well I found them here and ordered 2 cases and they were gone in 2 weeks, yes, I'm the guilty party.  Anyway, I'm ordering 2 more cases today.  The thing I like about them is of course the flavor and the fact that they are all natural.  The best chips I've ever had!  Keep them in stock, Amazon, cuz I'll be back again for more."
Hated it,"This review is about the product the seller was great!<br /><br />I heard it was good for sleep couldn't find it local so i bought it here. It stunk up my house, taste awful. save your money and buy any other tea out there."
Good popcorn,The flavor is good some of the kernels are small and either blow out of the hot air popper or result in small pieces of popcorn.  Over all I think the popcorn is good
Taste 1 - Ease of use 0,"Tastes great hard as heck to make. When I saw the box I thought to my self, Really? It was small but when you mix the ingredients you make quite a bit of batter Makes the exact amount the box says it does, I think it was 48 or 64 4inch churros, its been a few months since I bought them though. If you make them right they come out as churros, if you make them wrong you end up with a churro-funnel cake hybrid. Still tastes good regardless."
Delicious and healthy treat!,"I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!"
Good Chew,"I love that these chews aren't artificially flavored and colored and don't have any of those odd animal body parts (pig ear, cow toe whatever) that are kind of repulsive to think about. Even better, shaggy dog seems to like them, too.  I do have to admit that even after chewing this he has doggy breath, but there's no saying it wouldn't have been worse without these chews."
actually tastes good!,"I've been bodybuilding and drinking protein shakes for 20 years and they never taste very good, but this stuff in Strawberry flavor was damn good!  I'd recommend it"
wonderful,"My two tiny chihuahua's love Itty Bitty Buddy's treats.  They are hard to find, not at many pet stores.  It's the best treat ever....."
Greatest food ever!,My dogs have food allergies and I tried a holistic brand and they would not eat it. I tried the Newman's Own dry food and they loved it so I decided to add a little of the wet food. This food is not your standard wet food it looks more like mousse. It isn't a jelly loaf with yucky bits like some others. My dogs love it and lick their bowls clean.
Pretty Good Option for Gluten Free,We buy these to keep on hand when time is short and we need a quick snack between school & sport practices. There are not a lot of gluten free options that are not high in added sugar. We like these and Think Thin bars.
"Great Flavored Almonds, Hard to Get","This particular flavor of Blue Diamond almonds generally doesn't show up in grocery stores in this size cans. The occasional quick shop/gas station may carry them in the small bags. I travel and I look every time. It may not be everybody's favorite, but I'm sure glad I can get them in bulk."
Yuppy Puppy treat machine,This is our second machine. Both this dog and our previous dog love it. It's easy to train them and they enjoy accessing their treats. Wrigley takes laundry to the hamper and then is rewarded by clicking her treat machine. Our friends are amused by her ability to know when she can and cannot retrieve her reward. It's fun!
Excellent flavor but pricey and not very spicy.,"I've tried several brands of these and these are probably my favorite in terms of crispiness and salt content, but I'd hesitate to call them spicy and the price is just outrageous.  The packets are each very small and difficult to separate unless you want to cut them apart with scissors. But still, very tasty."
Our dogs love these,"We have 2 dogs, one is 8lbs and the other 12lbs and both of them love these.  One bone keeps them busy for about 30mins.  They are fairly small so if your dog is any larger than 15lbs you will probably want to get the next size up.  Even our 12lb dog could handle something bigger but we buy one size out of convenience.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend these but I suggest that you watch the price, as it seems to fluctuate a lot.  I bought two bags for the price that one is currently listed for!"
changed formulation?,"My Sheltie suffered from chronic constipation, my Border Collie mix had unexplained bouts of cramping diarhea (sp?) about once a month while on their trainer's recommended high-quality kibble diet from a feed store, supplemented with home-cooked veggies and chicken.  Once I switched to serving SOJO Comlete for one of their daily meals, both GI problems disappeared for good. They both loved the product and any 'pickiness' in their eating habits disappeared. Their coats are remarkable and they're all-around healthy, active dogs.<br /><br />BUT - I noticed a bag-to-bag inconsistency of the proportion of powder vs. chunks.  The company explaiuned to me about six months ago that they were aware of that and were about to make a change that would make it more consistent. Then about  4 months ago I noticed what I suspect was a change in formulation.  The product smelled strongly of broccoli.  My sheltie began nosing the pieces of broccoli aside, and then stopped eating SOJO food altogether.  I gave him back his kibble plus veggies, and after two months began substituting some of the SOJO back in.  Same result - not eating it.  So I began picking out the larger pieces of broccoli. I was surprised to find that his 1-cup portion of food contained nearly 1/4 c broccoli - fully 20% to 25% of the product.  For nearly $75 per bag?  Can you imagine your human diet consisting of one quarter broccoli?  I'm not happy and will again contact the company about this."
Bylers piccalilli is the best,"this is the best.  it brings back memories when we used to have this all the time in Massachusetts.  I have not been able to find anything close in years.  Thank you for this piccalilli.  I will be buying more, I will not share my first jar with anyone.  it is all mine!!!!!"
"good product, satisfies my hunger :)","I already wrote a review for the chocolate chip ones, though I thought I was writing it for this flavor, so I will just copy and paste. THe both taste good.<br /><br />I bought these bars as a meal replacement, since I am usually hungry about 4 hours after I had lunch, or 2-3 hours after breakfast, so I have to survive before the next meal. This does the job well. I can stay without eating for another 2-3 hours. It also depends how much water you drink, sometimes all you need is water to get rid of the ""hunger"". It's the way your body tells you you need water as well.<br /><br />My stomach is somewhat sensible and doesn't like a lot of stuff, but these bars never bother me.<br /><br />I also think they are tasty, but only the chocolate ones. I tried the strawberry ones, but they are too creamy. I also liked the chocolate chip ones, they both taste similar, though the chocolate chip ones have more fiber than these ones :P"
Will last a lifetime!,"This is a HUGE container of paprika.  I'll be lucky if I use it up within 5 years.  First time purchasing Spanish sweet paprika so I can't really compare the quality to any other, but it works for me."
Relief from the Texas sun,"These are great. As a Central Texas deck builder, I'm in the sun all day long. After years of struggling with hydration, I've finally found a solution. I freeze 2, 1 liter bottles and 1 gallon bottle every nite. I add 1 tab to each bottle and I haven't had a single problem hydrating this summer, no cramping at all. THANKS"
Quality premium dog food.,"My sister told me about Organix brand dog food.  After reading the ingredients I began buying it for my dogs.  I only feed them premium dog foods like Organix and Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers' Soul.  They contain real meat products and no fillers.  Organix takes this a step further with organic food in the ingredients.  The price is a bit higher, but it's worth it to have healthy pets!  My last dog died of cancer, and after a lot of research, I believe that high-quality pet food ingredients without fillers are the best plan for healthier pets!"
These are the real deal!!!  Great Snack.,"After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but ""popped"",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!"
This stuff is Awesome Sauce!!!,"I love Kraft 3 Cheese Ranch dressing, it goes great on buffalo wings and chicken strips. It is so creamy and delicious, you have to go out and get some for yourself and you will know exactly what I mean when you taste it. I am so happy that I found Kraft 3 Cheese on amazon.com because they stopped selling it in my area. Now that I am reunited with my Awesome Sauce, I am very happy."
Entirely too runny,"Purees are not supposed to be this thin.  What a mess!!  I make most of the food for my twins, but bought a few organic pouches to try while we were on vacation for Memorial Day.  I had an assortment of Plum Organics, Earth's Best and a few Ella's Organics.  The Plum are a much more normal consistency AND taste better all around.  I mixed this with Brown Cow cream top plain yogurt (as I have done with all the other fruit pouches I brought for the weekend). This particular packet was so runny it was like spoon feeding them a bottle! Can you say disaster?! Won't buy again."
Yerba Mate,"Overall a great product. Nothing to complain about at all with the product, loved it, the only issue was the cost of the shipping, but that is to be expected when you are purchasing something that weighs three kilos."
"Good price, OK quality","This jerky tastes okay, but it seems like this isn't made from the best quality meat.  I don't know if I got a bad batch, but all the jerky I ate had hard veins running through them. All in all, I would give 2.5 stars, but since I can't, and I don't like rounding up, I have to go with 2.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The Jerky is tender, but not overly tender.  It is a good consistancy (except for the occassional tough fiber running through them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />The quality of the meat was sub par, which says a lot, since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky (its basically dried ground meat).  As the other reviewers pointed out, the package says the beef could be from USA or from a variety of other countries.  I'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the US.<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br />The flavor was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  There are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor."
Greenies Pill Pockets,"Such a wonderful and easy way to give your pet a pill.  And with Amazon, it's much cheaper than buying them at the vet's office or any store.  And, my picky dog loves the taste."
yummy,"Quite tasty; mild chocolate flavor, good crunch, the right sweetness.  Maybe a teeny bit sandy, but that doesn't stop them from being a good snack or dessert.  Probably perfect for someone who doesn't like too rich a chocolate flavor. Also very tasty with peanut butter spread on them."
Best cookies in the world,"These cookies are fabulous. Flaky, not too sweet, fluffy not gooey layers. Small but not too small. Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies."
Really tasty snack,This has been a big hit at my house; great easy breezy prep and the taste is a bit spicy but not overwhelming.  Now I admit...not exactly health food here...but a good snack for the kids when they are hungry for nachos.  Pair this with Garden of Eatin chips and you have a perfect match.
Great Flavour!!,I only recently discovered this juice and have since been ordering it regularly; it tastes good; has a nice tangy flavor to it and is one of my regular monthly orders!<br /><br />Great price when you order it on Subscribe & Save too!
The BEST oyster sauce available!,"This is by far the BEST oyster sauce available for authentic Asian cooking, hands down. Get this local, it is WAY cheaper, should only be 2-4 bucks a large bottle.  I run out of oyster sauce frequently. If you like to cook Asian foods, get this!"
Great variety!,"I ordered the 35 variety pack before reading the reviews and I'm glad that I did because I might have been discouraged.  I received the k-cups yesterday in a small cardboard box, and they were all in good condition; no damage.  As far as variety, it's great!  I received many different flavors with only a few duplicates:<br /><br />Wolf Gang Puck-<br />2 Jamaica Me Crazy<br />2 Creme Caramel<br />1 Vanilla Francaise<br />2 Hawaiian Hazelnut<br /><br />Gloria Jeans-<br />2 French Vanilla Supreme<br />1 Mudslide<br />1 Hazelnut<br /><br />Green Mountain Coffee-<br />1 Pumpkin Spice<br />3 Mocha Nut Fudge<br />2 Southern Pecan<br />2 Caramel Vanilla Cream<br />2 Gingerbread<br />1 French Vanilla<br />2 Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />1 French Vanilla Ice Coffee<br /><br />Timothy's World Coffee<br />1 German Chocolate Cake<br />1 Decaf Hazelnut<br />1 Cinnamon Pastry<br />1 Mocha Java<br /><br />Donut House-<br />2 Cinnamon Roll<br />2 Chocolate Glazed Donut<br /><br />Kahlua-<br />2 Kahlua Original<br /><br />I know that this is a random sampling and there is no guarantee of which flavors you will get, but I received all the flavors I was hoping for and I can't wait to try my first cup!  I'm very pleased and I will order from this vendor again.  Thanks!"
why did I order this,"I just dont understand why the date on my fruit is stamped ""Best Before 05 Jan 12""!  I order in Feb. 2011.  What's the deal, stale fruit.  UGH"
Nothing Special,"I have to say from the beginning that I was a bit skeptical about the claims on the bottle of this product, the primary one being that it is ""Doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health."" There is no information as to what kind of doctor is making the claim or as to what the specific recommendation is for. I have to wonder if, in fact, the claim, is simply in reference to the fact that most doctors recommend water over any other hydration source.<br /><br />The label also claims proprietary technology in the bottling of this water. However, that technology is described as reverse osmosis, which is pretty standard in the water bottling industry (it's what keeps most bottled waters from being nothing more than tap water). The claim this water makes that is missing from other bottled waters is that it is ""infused with electrolytes"" and ""alkalinized and restructured using ionic Separation Technology."" Now, it's been a long time since I've had a science class, but the fact that the ingredient list includes ""purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride"" lead me to believe that this is nothing more than water that has been basically filtered and had some salt added to it to keep it soft.<br /><br />That being said, the taste of the water was just fine. It didn't have the chemically taste of tap water, but it wasn't as crisp as other bottled waters I've had (I'll take Aquafina or Arrowhead any day). I tried the water both chilled (as I prefer it) and at room temperature. Even chilled, it missed the crispness that I like in my water. It may simply be that I was expecting more considering the claims on the bottle; it may just as well be that it was over alkalinized. In either case, the taste neither bothered nor pleased me.<br /><br />As far as the size of the bottle itself, I'd say it's quite generous. At the current price of 28.25 for a dozen 1.5 liter bottles, it's a good value in comparison to other comparably sized bottles of water on the market. This makes it convenient for the mini-fridge at work, but much, much too large for the cup holder in the car where I'm more likely to want to grab a bottle of water for when I'm on the go."
Fabulous dog toy!,"I have two adopted greyhounds, and they both love this toy, whether with or without the rawhide rings.  One of them is a very tough chewer, and she's destroyed a lot of toys that have been labeled as ""indestructable"" or ""for tough chewers.""  My other hound likes soft, plush, squeaky toys, and I wanted to find a toy for him to chew on to help keep his teeth clean, and he loves this one.  This toy fits the bill for both of my hounds!"
Delicious and not bad for you,"I don't like sweet potatoes but I do like sweet potato fries.  I love these Popchips Sweet Potato Chips, they are very tasty.  There isn't a lot of salt, fat, or carbs.  My only complaint is each bag only contains .8 ounces, but I guess they wanted the bag to be exactly 100 calories.<br /><br />The rest of the Popchips line is great too.  Not fried or baked, and reasonably healthy."
No Interest from Avid Bone Chewers,"I have 2 dogs, both lab mix, and these bones do not hold their interest.  They are agressive chewers and like just about type of bone I give them (antler, knuckle, sterilized and the like). They are especially eager when I give them a bone they've never tried before.  However, neither of them chewed these bones for more than 5 minutes.  The only part they seemed to like was the stuffing.  I dropped one on the floor and some of the stuffing came out and my boy ate that up.  But they did not enjoy them otherwise."
My Grandkids will not eat this,I have 3 Grandkids (3 different families) all 2 years old and I can not get any of them to eat this stuff they all hate it. I'm not sure what brands their parents by them from the local grocery store but I will have to see if I can give these to someone else because they will not eat it ugh. What a waste of money
made my Saturday morning.,"I don't have a coffee maker that takes the individual little packages this comes in so I undid them and placed them as regular grounds in my regular coffee maker. Each portion was more than the spoonfull I might have used, very generous portion, and made a grea tasting smooth brew with just the right amount of bitternss that even my wife commented on the taste being ""really good"". I did the same on Sunday morning and diluted the amount to almost half strength and it still more than held its own as a great tasting brew. Don't know if I would use it as a replacement to the one I use consistently but would most definetly buy it as a replacement if I was unable to find my brand."
Coffee for tea drinkers...,"As a general rule I gravitate toward heavy bodied, dark coffees but rules are made to be broken. From time to time even I bring home a medium blend to break things up. I was quite excited to give Marley Coffee a try but found that a name can't make up for a yucky cup.<br /><br />As lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is I found it lacked the body I look for in a cup of coffee. That said the taste was so pleasant and delicate I actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags. The result was actually delicious but far more tea-like than I would pay for in a coffee pod.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea I would definitely recommend the One Love Organic Coffee pods. Otherwise I would suggest a pass."
Yummy,"I like using this matcha for latte smoothies and so far it has been yummy.  Saves me $$$ at the coffee shop, because now I make my own."
Pretty good taste,"I bought this because I have stopped eating white flour, white rice and white pasta.  I often associate a bitter taste with whole wheat products but that wasn't the case here.  This pasta takes longer to cook than white pasta.  It has a clean taste and if you close your eyes you wouldn't know it was the healthier whole wheat alternative to white pasta."
I Like It!,"I'm having a cup of this coffee as I am writing this review. It was the deal most of all that made me buy this Tully's blend. I think Tully does make some of the best kcups I have had though. Love the Kona blend but now is quite expensive. This has a nice flavor to me but could be a bit stronger. That being said, if I get another deal on this blend, I will definately by it again."
Stinky,"Unfortunately, my cat refuses to eat this cat food.  I think it might be the smell.  Too expensive to take a chance and try another of this brand.  So I won't be ordering more."
This is MILD not MEDIUM roast,"While the product description on Amazon is ""Medium Roast"", this is actually ""Mild"" - clearly seen on the lower left of the package in the photo.  I didn't know this until I received my shipment today.  (I wish I had paid more attention to the photo.)<br /><br />I haven't tried the coffee because I'm generally a fan of stronger coffee.  I just wanted to warn that the description was incorrect."
great food a bit high on fat,"My dog really loves it, it had no side affects.<br />The only thing is that she gained some weight since she started with this food and even when I took off quite a bit from the recommended amount, it still doesn't help."
"Adequate, but not enough to buy again.","I thought the flavor was decent, but that it just reminded my husband and I too much of something we would buy at our local gas station. This specific K-cup only makes a very small cup before turning into just dumping water, and therefore was never sufficient for my husband to drink. I should have read the reviews before purchasing, as it seems that others are having some similar feelings!"
Oreo Birthday cookie,Wish they would sell them all year long. Very good and also very sweet sent them to daughter who had the same birthday.
Excellent dry spice,"I lightly sprinkle this spice seasoning on pork,beef,chicken,ground meats for burgers always and have for many years.the mixture is well balanced and needs no extra seasoning to add. I even use on fish with great results. what I like about this seasoning is it does not over power the flavor of the meat or fish you apply it to. I try not to over season anything,I want the true flavors to dominate and for the seasoning to accenuate. this it does very well!!<br />Rosemary..."
My Dogs Love Canidae!!!!!,"My dogs have been eating Canidae for years.  They have always done well on the food.  Currently, I have three dogs and they have had no issues with the new formulations.  I have to say that my black lab mix has an even brighter coat than before.  I love that they came out with a 44# bag.  With three dogs I go through a lot of dog food.  I definitely recommend this food."
A Unique Tea!,Pu'erh Tuo-Cha is a unique tea. Smooth flavor with no bitterness. Don't let the dark color fool you. Try it... you will like it!
As advertised,excellent product as described. Lemon tang  is there to taste. 7-10 drops and your set to go<br />Taste is lemon tang and give my tea a healthily kick.
I love this Coffee,"I love this Coffee!  I love that I can sign up with Amazon and get it delivered to my door and not have to search in the grocery stores for it, which half the time I can't find it.  Way to go Amazon, thank you!!!"
Skip the V8,"This is by far the best organic vegetable juice out there. Low sodium, organic and is flavored with lemon juice and jalapeno. With free Amazon shipping, I drink a glass of this stuff every day. It is great and well worth the price!"
filling meal,"Delicious straight from the can, garnished with fresh veggies or over a baked potato.  Nice counterpoint to whole grain bread and salad.  Filling but not fat laden."
Very nice green tea,"This is a very nice, full flavored green tea. Also very convient in the K-Cup packaging. I have tasted some lose leaf premium green tea that is a little better, but much more expensive and not in K-Cup style."
Good Brew,"I am not sure if these are meant just to be used in those coffee makers that make one single cup at a time. I don't have one of those. But I still am enjoying this coffee. I heat water in a mug and then add one of these coffee pods and brew it like a tea bag. I also take a spoon and squeeze water through the pod while it brews in my cup to get a strong coffee out of it.<br /><br />Of all the different coffees I have had, like Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Folgers, and so forth, the coffee this most reminds me of is Starbucks. It is not exactly the same, but I would think someone who likes Starbucks roasts would probably enjoy this.<br /><br />I like the nice box and especially that each coffee pod is individually wrapped to keep them fresh."
Love these bags,"I love these bags.  I have a very large black lab that makes very large & stinky #2s.  I live in a NYC building in the middle of an avenue, so I generally bring my dog's waste back into the building with me, up the elevator, and then I dispose of it down the trash chute.  If I don't use scented bags to mask the smell when I take the elevator back up, my neighbors would be very unhappy!  These work perfectly for me & my doggie."
Awesome!,"These treats are perfect for my little dog.  They are thin enough to not intimidate him, but they last for a long while.  He loves these things and they keep him busy for hours!"
"My cat loves Spot's Stew, and I know it's good for him.","I've seen other reviewers say their cats wouldn't eat the vegetables in Spot's Stew. Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's."
Cat begs to clean teeth!,"My geriatric cat loves these treats. He begs every time I sit down at my desk (treats are stored in a drawer).  Hard to say No to my companion of many years, especially since the treat is good for his mouth's health. But I remember not to over feed since he loves them so much."
"wonderful, healthy product","I would love to only feed my baby homemade baby food, but since that isn't an option, due to time constraints, I love using the HappyBaby brand.At least I know it's healthy!"
Great Orchid addition,"This was a great deal for a chocolate orchid, which is quite pricey, and came in a well cared for manner as well as looking very much alive. It did not come ready to bloom as stated in the details of the item but it is on its way to blooming and think this is a very good product for a person who knows how to take care of orchids."
Wonderful popcorn!,We received this popcorn as a gift along with the 8oz popper from the same manufacturer. I am completely pleased! I save the salt for after the corn is popped so I can flavor to taste.  It pops fast and tastes terrific!
Awesome formula for my baby!!!,"It was recommended by my pediatrician as my baby's first formula to replace the breast milk. My baby loves it, he never spits up and it's easy to digest. Great formula, great price."
One of the Best,"I'm a one-a-day coffee drinker, so my one cup must ""wow"" in the morning...consistently. Of course the Green Mountain brand works, but I decided to try the San Francisco Bay brand because it was cheaper. I have a new love! I have the perfect cup of intense, sharp, hello-I'm-awake-now coffee every morning.<br /><br />One caveat: You must love dark roast coffees. French Roast is not for the faint of heart."
Very Tasty,These are the best tasting of the Crown Prince offerings for Sardines in Olive Oil.
Great tea,"I use this tea as part of my supplements in gymming. It Worked perfectly in cleansing my system, and helping me maintain my weight."
Bugles hit the mark on this one...tasty!,"I have dental problems, so my enjoyment of normal crunchy things isn't what it used to be.<br />I can't eat popcorn anymore, for example.<br /><br />That being said, I had to say that I LOVE these Bugles!<br />They dissolve fairly easily, so I would guess they are easy to chew too.<br /><br />The taste? Great! The closest I can come is like caramel corn without the hulls!<br />A little sweet, a little salt (our bag was not overly salty like another reviewer had mentioned),<br />and a lot of very tasty!<br /><br />I didn't even look at the ingredients or calorie count on this one, because quite frankly,<br />there are times that I just don't care. This is one of them.<br />Of course, don't eat anything like this every day, but when you can't decide between sweet or salty,<br />this will fill the void!<br /><br />Great job Bugles - this one is a keeper!"
Not Good,"I am a low carb dieter and was worried this bread was ""to good to be true"" when I ordered it.  The bread came out very bitter and I could not finish the loaf.  I must admit I am not much of a cook or have much experience with baking so there is a chance the bad bread was a screw up on my part."
Sensible Portions Veggie Snacks 24-1oz Bags 3 flavors,"These are great alternative over regular chips. I'm a Weight Watchers client and these are only 3 points vr 5 - 7 points eating other brands of chips. And to top it of they have a great taste.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056WJZRG"">Sensible Portions Veggie Snacks 24-1oz Bags 3 flavors</a>"
Exactly what I hoped for!,"Love being able to get this product in bulk; nutritious, good price & prompt receipt."
GREAT treats for your four legged friends,"These Bistro Beef treats remind me of beef jerky. but for dogs! Heck, it even smells like beef jerky. The ingredients are very healthy and it's actually made with real beef.<br /><br />My dogs go crazy every time they see the bag with the funny looking dog taken out. They are willing to do almost anything for it and they try to steal it from each other. Each piece is a pretty decent size and I have medium-sized dogs. One of them has to chew at it a little bit before he's able to take it down. The pieces may be a little bit big for smaller dogs but as long as they don't gulp it all at once, it should be OK.<br /><br />I have a black lab mix and a border collie mix and both enjoy it immensely. They have forgotten about their other treats."
new guiltless pleasure,"I came across these on a dinnerless night while waiting in line at Marshall's. I think i had most the bag gone before i got to a cashier. Now i go to Marshall's specifically to buy these since i havent found them elsewhere. I buy 3 bags at a time and they are only $1.49/bag. I SIMPLY LOVE THESE in all flavors and prefer them to chips. Now that i can buy them by the case, the next line I will be standing in may just be to a rehab. Im addicted!"
they must be good!,"I wrapped these up for the family dog this Christmas, and come Christmas morning she was so eager to get to the treats that she tore the present open herself,haha! The treats are made from quality ingredients and are rich in protein(on the packaging is a guide that says how much to give your dog at a time depending upon your dog's weight--too many are too much). Bootsy hasn't refused one of these yet!"
Sage tea,"Great product. Does not completely get rid of hot flashes and night sweats, but seriously reduces their number and intensity. I tried everything else and this is the only thing that made any difference. I now get reasonable sleep at night."
Love the taste,I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of these crackers.They are slightly sweet (not too much) and are perfect for a late afternoon snack.I am going to try some of their other products too.
Great Item at a Great Price!,"I live in an area with limited choices for organic eating. In searching for solutions, I came across this deal and I am so glad that I did. I purchased the 8lb deal which consists of 8 one pound resealable packages which is fantastically convenient. Being organic, fairly traded, reasonably priced, and healthy makes this a great deal all the way around."
"Mmmmm, Tastey","Well, I'm not much of a cook, especially Indian food and the sheer amount of spices I would be wasting trying to make any of these outstrips the cost of purchasing these meals.  I tried to make Palak Paneer before, and it didn't work out.  So until I can get in that Indian Cooking class, I resort to pre-made or take out for a fix.<br /><br />All of the varieties in this pack are good.  Some are better than others, the only one that is lack luster is the Palak Paneer.  The down side to these is that they contain a lot of your daily salt intake.  The upside is that they don't have to be refrigerated, you get a good variety and they are fast to make.  If you pre-cook some rice, you can just put some in a bowl, pour the contents of the pouch on top and pop in the microwave for a minute or so and you're read to eat.  And with fresh cooked rice, just dump it on, the heat from the rice will warm it up.<br /><br />Warning:  Besides the Palak Paneer, I would characterize these a fairly spicy for Western gullets.  If you suffer from anything thing that precludes spicy foods, I'd stay away, most of this is probably nothing you want to deal with.<br /><br />I'm actually not ordering this anymore because I have tried to cook more myself and these were making it too easy to just say screw it.<br /><br />Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry - this is good, not much of a lentil fan until I had this.<br />Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese - just so-so, cheese is not consistent, no real mph to it.<br />Rajma Masala - Red Kidney Bean Curry - I do not like kidney beans, but I love this, this one is a little spicy.<br />Navratan Korma - Mixed Vegetable & Cottage Cheese Curry - Good, again, the cheese is not great, but better than the Palak<br />Jpav Bhaji - Mashed Vegetable Curry, - super good, spicy.<br />Pindi Chana-Chick Pea Curry - I love this one with the chickpeas.<br /><br />The kidney beans and the chick peas really reminded me of chili.  You could put them over fritos and you wouldn't be disappointed.<br /><br />For fast, easy Indian dish from your pantry, you could do worse than this product."
"Perfect coffee, customized for taste and quantity","The Saeco machine gives my wife and I that perfect cup of coffee brewed from freshly ground beans, at whatever time we want and in whatever quantity from 1/4 to full cup.  And, we don't have to leave home to get it!  The strength of each brew can be adjusted with the turn of a knob.  The machine is light weight and setting it up is easy.  The Saeco is easy to clean and has a nice upscale look on the kitchen counter.  Each individual cup is quickly made with the push of a button which provides a fresh hot cup rather than a pour from a pot that has been sitting on a warming plate.  There are no pods to open and change out each time, either.  We just bought another machine for my office!"
What a treat!,Our dog loves these treats and we love how good they are for him. Amazon has also been the best deal we've gotten for them. Petsmart & Petco are a lot more expensive and don't have all the flavor choices.
YUM!,"This is the second time I have bought this product, and I just love it.. Dark Chocolate, as you know, is a lot better for you then Milk Chocolate, and so around Xmas time I bought my first one. It was a Hit at my house and when you put a candy cane or some mini marshmellows in it, your kids will love it. My grandson usually doesnt like Dark Chocolate, but he sure drink enough of it when it was cold outside. Since most of that box was drank during the winter months, I had to buy another one, JUST in case it got cold during the spring and its nice to have around if people dont like coffee or tea.<br /><br />So I would recommend this to all!!"
Cut Rock Candy,"This candy is very true to color, as yellow will be lemon, red will be cherry, etc.  The only little problem is that the  candies do stick together at times."
Wonderfully fresh,I was very happy with the quick delivery of this product and how fresh the beans were.  I am looking forward to my homemade vanilla extract once it is done brewing.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
bread,this is one of the breads we make instead of store bought bread flavor is great and easy to make
Definitely a good breakfast indeed!,"Not too bold, not too weak...not bitter.  Good way to start if your not into the real strong coffees.  My husband and I have added the Wolfgang Puck ""Breakfast in Bed"" line and the ""Rodeo Drive"" flavors to our buying ritual."
great (hot) new flavor....,"I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in."
yucky,"I was very excited to try this coffee flavor, but when I did, I was very dissapointed.  I think the flavor is too strong, especially since it tastes really fake.  It almost tastes like there is alcohol in it.  Since I ordered the double box, I gave one away to a friend who likes this flavor. I would never buy this coffee again."
"couldn't wait..disappointed, bad batch?","I was so excited to order and receive these sun cups. When I opened the package, I found the chocolate looked like it had a white film all over and it was dry and not creamy at all. Since there were so many good reviews, I am wondering if I have received a bad batch. Any one have any thoughts?"
another five star review,WOW.  so many salt and vinegar snacks disappoint... i've only ever been satisfied by herr's... everyone else seems to be pretty weak.<br /><br />in steps blue diamond almonds with their take on salt 'n vinegar... i just received my shipment and i can't leave these things alone!  i'm going to get another order later in the year & give them out as christmas presents =]
Best Catfood,"My cat is picky.  He also gets an upset stomach over other varieties of cat food.  However, Science diet adult optimal works best.  It was used at the shelter we bought him and he loves it and this big bag, as long as it is put in a Gallon sized tupperware type container is about half price of any pet food store."
"Directmuz, TN",The best granola I have ever eaten. All of the flavors are wonderful and the quality of Udi's Granola are superior! Great product. Even my teenagers love it and fight over the Hawaiian flavor.
Great Spaghetti Noodles!,"This is really wonderful spaghetti.  The noodles cook up evenly and it is not tacky like the store brands. My wife and step-daughter laughed at me ordering 20 lbs of noodles until they actually ate them.....no more laughing.  Mueller's is not a brand we have in the stores in Puyallup, so it is a very great pleasure having these.  Thank you!"
"Agavae Nectar, Amber",I haven't uses this to much yet as I bought it mainly for baking and on pancakes. It does taste good tho
Expensive Beef Chunks,"They are astronomically expensive (check out the ""regular"" prices) but they are quality and delicious. There probably is equal to and cheaper out there but it is nice as a splurge and they are delivered to you so you don't need to go in search of good beef. Every piece is guaranteed to be yummy, no guess work involved."
Sour Patch Watermelon are delicious!,"Pros:<br />- Sour Patch Watermelon are delicious<br />- The candy is fresh and not stale<br />- Individually wrapped means I can't binge eat like I did with my 3.5 lb bag of Swedish fish<br />- Great for sharing and having around for friends<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Individually wrapped means I can't binge eat like I did with my 3.5 lb bag of Swedish fish<br />- If you lack self control, may not be a good idea to get this as they are delicious"
Great bold flavor and great value,"Love these k-cups, bold flavor similar to Jet Fuel or Big Easy with less of a French roast flavor.  I can actually get a 12 Oz. cup and still have good flavor."
great sauce,I was first introduced to Pickapeppa sauce when a friend of mine started traveling back and forth to Jamaica. I was hooked the first time I tried it. I have had trouble finding the sauce here in the states and was thrilled to find it on this site and in  bulk no less!! The price was as expected and shipment arrived in a decent amount of time.
Cherry Balsamic Vinegar,"Delicious; very smooth! Very pricey, including the S&H, which was almost as much as the item. Probably wouldn't buy this product again for this reason."
Not happy with this product,"I have a great amount of experience with water kefir; have been producing it at home for many years and enjoying the great health benefits gained from drinking it daily.  I wanted to share this experience with a friend and thought to bring DEHYDRATED grains with me on a visit to get her started.  I did not want to travel a lond distance with wet grains (I could have shared my own) and thought it would be easier to bring them dried.  The product description here states that they are dehydrated grains...NOT true.  What I received was a padded manila envelope, a ziploc baggy with about 1 to 2 teaspoons of some very badly crushed, wet grains (looked like they got squished by the postage cancelling machine used by the Post Office), and a photocopy of instructions.  Not as described or pictured in this listing.  The grains smelled bad and so far, have not been able to produce good quality kefir.  Who is the product manufacturer...Real Man of Genius? It is most certainly not Cultures for Health as pictured.<br /><br /> ""Each Packet of Water Kefir Starter Culture Contains: 2 teaspoons Live active water kefir culture in a dehydrated state (will rehydrate to 3-4 tablespoons of water kefir grains; sufficient to yield 2-3 quarts of water kefir every 24-48 hours). For additional information on this product, please contact the manufacturer."""
Amazing cheeze curls,"I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.<br /><br />I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls - it's good and probably better.<br /><br />P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia - total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!"
Flavorful coffee,"I have acid reflux disease, so I try to stick to foods and drinks that won't cause me any grief.  This coffee tastes great and I don't have any tummy problems when I drink it."
Very addicting - be warned,This is a very good granola flavor. Very dificult to put the bag down and walk away - you have been warned.
"DECEPTIVE USE OF ""NATURAL""","WARNING: This is NOT natural peanut butter.  There is ADDED Sugar, which is HORRIBLE for anybody following a sensible diet!"
My dog loves this food!!,"My Tibetin Terrior is 3 years old and has been on Wellness food since birth.  I just recently found Newman's Own Organics.<br />The price was a bit cheaper, plus free shipping to my home!  AWESOME!  When I started to gradually change foods.  My LIVI,<br />would eat only the Newmans' and leave the Wellness to later when she was really hungry.  So Funny!  She is the ""queen"" and she knows it!!"
expensive cliff crunch bars,"These are not original cliff bars, but the smaller lower quality Cliff crunch bars.  You can get these same bars in the same packaging at Walmart for 3 bucks for a box of 10."
Major Disappointment ... Stale and Yucky,"The 0810 sell buy date on the packets is a FAIL, these are already past their prime. I will not purchase this again.<br /><br />Nice big walnut and pecan halves perked up my taste buds. However, the nuts in this mixture were STALE and made the overall mix taste yucky. The rancid taste had permeated even the cranberries, raisins etc. Needless to say my healthy TV snacks were a major disappointment."
Delicious,"My new favorite snack.  While visiting my son in Richmond, had the opportunity to try these.  They are delicious.  Love them."
Perfect,Excellent product! I recived 35 different cups with no doubles. Love the variety! The product came in a brown paper bag within the box. All cups were intact. I will reorder!!
Loved the Dark Chocolate; now I want to try the Lemon...,"I ran across the dark chocolate ones in Italy at an Autogrill highway rest area.  There were snacks aplenty, but the picture on the bag + the fact that it had an extra 20% attracted me.  So, I got a 10.58 oz bag!  I find them satisfying after eating just a few.  It seemed like a never-ending bag.  I googled when I got home, hoping to figure out where to buy more, and ended up here.  I'm glad I did because, after reading some other reviews, now I'm anxious to try the lemon ones!"
FINALLY!,"Got a Keurig for Christmas, and have spent the past two months trying to find great coffee that is also affordable.  Over a dollar each for the ones that I was getting at the grocery store was just not cutting it for me.  I purchased a reusable K-cup.  Couldn't stomach the weak coffee it made, and that was with superfine ground coffee.  Not to mention that it often only brewed half a cup.  So, after trying many different types, I decided I liked the taste of the Starbucks Sumatra the best, but it was way too expensive.  Come to find out, Green Mountain makes the Starbucks K-cups.  So I decided to try Green Mountain, as it is MUCH more affordable.<br />It's GREAT!  Nice, strong, flavorful cup of coffee!  FINALLY!"
This tea is amazing.,I'm more of a tea drinker than coffee. I am sick and needed some hot tea so my wife bought these English Breakfast Tea K-Cups for me while she was at the store. I had only used the Keurig for coffee so I was a bit skeptical. This tea is amazing. I am going to keep it stocked in my pantry from now on.
Not for small dogs!,"I have two chihuahuas who couldn't even get their mouths around these treats.  I would have broken them into smaller chunks, but they are very hard.  So, for small dogs these treats are a bust, but I took them next door and tried them out on my neighbors golden labs and they were a hit!  I'd guess that any dog over about 30-40 pounds would be able to crack into these treats without a problem, but dogs smaller than that probably won't be able to chew them."
It's pretty good,"The packaging says it's sweet and salty and it is.  It's also kind of crunchy, gooey and sticky but that's not a bad thing for a snack bar.  I like the taste because it's not overly sweet, the salt mediating the sweetness.  The Pure Natural bar is being promoted as a healthy snack with natural ingredients.  In my opinion, they beat the heck out of the taste of some of the other healthy snacks I've found for sale at the local health food stores but they're not quite as tasty as some of the commercially available ""not-health-food"" bars you can find at the supermarket or warehouse stores.<br /><br />While it's not promoted as being a ""diet food"", I had to compare the nutritional information on the packaging with two other products we had in the kitchen cabinet--Sunbelt's Oats & Honey Chewy Granola Bar and Nature Valley's Chewy Fruit & Nut Trail Mix Bar.  The Pure Natural bar is a little bit larger than the other two (1.5 oz vs 1.4 oz. for the Sunbelt and 1.2 oz. for Nature Valley).  The Pure Natural bar has 200 calories per bar with 12 g of fat and 230 mg of sodium.  Nature Valley bars have 140 calories, 4 g of fat and 65 mg of sodium while the Sunbelt bar has 180 calories, 7 g of fat and 85 mg of sodium.  Without getting into the healthy characteristics of the ingredients of all three products, those people who wish to reduce their intake of fat, sodium and calories will find there are alternate products to the Pure Natural bars with lower numbers per serving.  The Pure Natural bars do have a significant advantage over the other bars in the protein levels--7 grams for Pure Natural and 2 to 3 grams for the other products.  And, for the record, the Sunbelt granola bars have a whopping 4.5 g of saturated fat--23% of the daily value.  That's more than double the Pure Natural bars and more than 10X the saturated fat of the Nature Valley bars.<br /><br />So...I like the taste of the bars but, honestly, I wouldn't go out of my way to find them or pay a lot more for them.  According to my wife, who recently bought a box of the Nature Valley bars, she spent less than $10 for a box of 30.  When I consider the price, taste and nutritional information, the Pure Natural bars come up a little short.  If you're one of those people who just has to have something labeled as natural that promotes itself as a healthy choice, they might be worth it to you."
wonderful Greenies,"A friends told me how much her dogs love Greenies. I was skeptical, a dog loves Any treat but i decided to buy some to give my dogs and I am sold, they just LOVE Greenies even my little picky boy who is very choosy, soon as he sees the Greenies box he runs to get his share. from now on they will get a Greenies everyday for a treat."
Sojos,"We ordered two large bags. The package arrived on time. The dogs are gobbling it up, they are loving it."
"The ""paws down"" favorite among canned food!","My female Pixie Bob cat, Pawnee, is extremely finicky about her canned food.  She will touch nothing but Instinct's rabbit formula, and licks her plate clean each morning.  The Instinct brand is nothing but the best, whether it is a canned formula or dry."
A Christmas Tradition,"Absolutely the best!  Well worth the price, the flavor is rich and true.  I buy all four bags for someone on my gift list every Christmas.  He likes them so much that he at first pretends the box is empty, so he can take his time about sharing."
Good hot sauce,"It is hot and not overpowering, you can also taste the food."
Not that great.  Shouldn't be labeled oreos as they really aren't.,"This review is for the peanut butter fudge oreos. Evidently they may have the same code as the fudge cremes as this is the link I was given to review them from the Vine program. The peanut butter fudge oreos are not really oreos in my opinion. They really shouldn't use the name Oreo as I personally think it implies that they have an oreo taste somewhere in them. Yes there is a VERY thin oreo crust cookie in them but that taste is overwhelmed by the peanut butter and fudge. It hardly has any taste of oreo at all. Also, these cookies are very thin and there aren't as many as I expected in the package. Nobody in my household likes these cookies. Everyone who has tried them says they are nothing special and are a very forgettable cookie. I'm sure there are some people who like them, just not us."
Awesome product,"How can you go wrong with a 100% fruit snack that is both crunchy and delicious? The three flavors are all great. Granny Smiths are a little tart (in a good way), Fujis are sweet, and Cinnamon are absolutely delicious. I give the 15g bags to my kids. Equal to one apple. What a perfect snack! I feel great giving it to them. I eat the 48g with lunch. Filling and low calorie. Hope it helps."
"Not bad...not for everyday, for me :-)",It was everything the reviews said it was. I thought it was best when I brewed on the large setting and then rotated the cup 180 degrees and brewed on the smallest setting. Made a large mug-ful and was tasty too.
Keurig Who????,"I was so excited to get my box of Fog Chaser. I had been paying nearly $40 for Starbucks at a wholesale club and only for 40 cups. I had cut myself to one cup per day! Then my friend shared this link and I thought ""Why not!"" It arrived quickly, and smelled heavenly. I like dark, strong coffee, and I could tell by the smell it would fit the bill. The real test is in making it. I brewed it this morning--no grounds in my coffee, and no residue left in my cup. Wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work, and it does. How great is that???? It doesn't taste like instant coffee either, which some imitations do. 80 cups for $33 is an awesome deal...that is around $0.42 a cup. If you buy the little boxes at WalMart you only get 18 for $10..which is around $0.61 per cup...you save $0.19 per cup, which doesn't sound like a lot, but you would spend $50 buying as much at WalMart to get 80 K cups. So you are saving $17. I love it!!! Order yours today, you won't be disappointed."
Hard to find.,I found these a few years ago in my local store and loved them. Now all the stores around me stopped carrying it.
Yummy,"I can't eat dark chocolate and so these White Chocolate Reese's peanut butter cups are really a nice alternative. The texture is wonderful, and the peanut butter so creamy and delicious, you forget that there is no milk chocolate in this product."
TEN stars,"These are delicious - very little sweetener - just pure nuts and chocolate. A great snack, minimal carbs (16g carb, 10g protein, 12g fat) - fits the Barry Sears or Eades philosophies of limiting carbs. Whatever - they TASTE good!"
Delicious soft kernels,"Kernels are small and softer than traditional white corn. Great flavor even eaten plain. My traditional is with flax oil and real salt, tarragon optional if I want a savory corn. I was informed cinnamon is good too."
Good coffee,"Many people rate things 5 stars because they like them.  I rated this four stars because I really liked it and drink all my coffee black.  This is a very flavorful, smooth coffee.  You won't likely be disappointed."
Only waffle mix I use,"I first tried this waffle mix staying at a hotel. They had one of those make-your-own waffles and this was the mix that they used. Best waffle I've ever had. So I tracked down the mix at a Williams-Sonoma store and paid way too much. I'm glad to see it here on Amazon.com, even though I have to buy three giant containers of it at once. Oh well, we'll use it all over time. It makes a delicious, perfectly brown and toasty waffle. Mmmmm."
My dog doesnt like it.,It wasn't very effective because my dog won't chew on it!! and she chews on everything from a cardboard to a lamp post.
These are GREAT!!!!!,"I just started the Atkins Low Carb diet plan on Monday - - I have done this before, but eventually, I have fallen off the 'wagon' so to speak, and each fall resulted in the lost pounds finding their way back and bringing their friends to stay for a while...  One of the things that I really crave while on this eating plan is something salty and crunchy...  I went on a search for pork rinds (the big bags in the market are tasteless and get soggy too quickly), and ordered these because the bag looked like one I had bought before....<br /><br />They just arrived and OMG, they are wonderful...  Salty, crunchy, flavorful and satisfying...  I know that this product will help me stay on program...  I will be ordering from you regularly...  Thanks...."
My dog LOVES them,"What can you say about dog treats. Either your dog likes them or they don't. Mine LOVES these. By far her favorite treat. I only feed her high-quality food and treats, and these fit that mold. They look and smell like regular chicken jerky.<br /><br />Edit: Since these are Chinese-made, I don't use them anymore."
Five Star Pasta,"This is the best whole wheat spaghetti I've ever had.  It goes way beyond other brands.  Please read my complete review under Gia Russa whole wheat Roman rigatoni, which includes some detail, two recipes and a review of the whole wheat angel hair pasta as well."
The best of the best #1 beef jerky,I LOVE THIS BEEF JERKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the second time I have ordered and both times i got it on time. The jerky is the best in the world. It is the only one I have tasted that lets me know that I am eating beef jerky not sugar syrup  jerky.<br />I took some to work and my whole bag was gone by then end of the day.<br /><br />Thanks a bunch for the delicious treats
Great biscotti!,"Since I can't eat wheat, whole eggs, yeast or soybean oil, I'm very limited in my cookie choices unless I bake them myself.<br /><br />These are GREAT with coffee in the morning or when you want a snack.  Not too sweet, good chocolate taste and very crunchy.  Unfortunately, they're almost five dollars a box at the health food store, so I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.<br /><br />I'll be buying eight boxes of them, so I guess that says it all!"
Green Tea & Pomegranate K-Cups,The product was exactly what I wanted and well<br />packaged. I am pleased will be a continuing purchaser of this product.
My Dogs LOVE Greenies!,My three dogs love Greenies.  So much so that they know the exact time every evening they are supposed to get them! They act like kids in a candy store!
Not that G'day Gourmet Tuna taste I was hoping for!,"I loved G'day Gourmet Tuna in Tomato Onion and Salsa Tomato. Since they are not available, I ordered this Safcol Tomato Salsa in hope to substitute the G'day Gourmet. Not even close! Watery, salty and not as tasty. Alas..."
I didn't like it.,"I found the coffee to be too weak. I wonder what his Un-Jazzed Up coffee is like, it must be like drinking plain boiled water. This coffee is only good if you like your coffee weak or make a 6 oz cup maybe."
Great food and ingredients But Doggie likes his other food better!,"My Dog has G.I. issues and I thought this food would be better for him with a suggestion from another pet owner...<br />However, My dog still prefers ""ROYAL CANIN"" for boxers...<br />I think for a boxer, it is harder for them to get a hold of the little chunks of food as opposed to the ""custom"" shaped nuggets Royal Canin provides in their product...<br />I will stick with Royal Canin...<br />Its not about what is better for them, its what THEY like in the end..."
wayyyy too salty,"it's good cut meat, but wayyyy too salty, can't taste much beside salt, i really want to wash it before i eat."
Green Cow Rawhides,"I thouht""green"" would be a good thing to try. These bones split too easily and the dogs didn't digest them very well. I'm wanting to return the unopened packages but I'm having difficulty getting direction from the company."
Arrived Fast,-- - - - Item arrived in perfect condition and very quickly. Would definitely buy from them again. - - - ---
Pleasant Taste but Light on Raisins,"I really love raisins and always keep a large box in the pantry; this probably explains my disappointment with Kellogg's Raisin Bran Crunch Cereal, it doesn't have enough raisins to suit me. I have found other brands of crunchy raisin bran cereal that have a lot more raisins. Kellogg's advantage is its wide availability; you can find it at most stores.<br /><br />The obvious solution is to add some raisins out of my raisin box to the cereal which is exactly what I do. I'm always a little disappointed when I have to do that.<br /><br />I have found the sweetness to be just right for me and enjoy the cereal right down to the bottom of the bowl. I also enjoy adding almonds to the cereal or even a banana. This is a favorite of my mine for supper and I enjoy it several times a week."
Delicious,"Since I spotted this coffee on the shelf, it has been love at first sip.  It is a smooth, full-bodied, bold cup of coffee with just the right amount of caramel overtones...not sicky-sweet caramel, but just a delightful cup of coffee with a wonderful aroma and just the right touch of caramel for the mature coffee drinker.  I prefer it black, but for a wonderful relaxing drink for dessert, I sometimes add a bit of sweetener and half and half....HEAVEN!  I have also tried the cinnamon and vanilla, but the caramel is my favorite."
Best Healthy Potato Chip!,"I absolutely love Pop Chips as a healthy alternative to regular, fatty chips.  The Seat Salt and Pepper and the Sour Cream and Onion are my favorites.  I don't crave regular chips at all!"
the same as everything,"These are good treats, but I can not say that they are any better than any other. They are bassically the same as any average treat."
"good, but doesn't taste exactly like peanut butter","I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that powdered peanut butter made with water is not as creamy or smooth as peanut butter made with oil. This product is yummy, and I do eat it, but I've found I eat more than I would if I were eating regular peanut butter because it's not as satisfying. It's not as easy to spread on bread, though it's fine for my celery and peanut butter afternoon snack. I bought both the peanut butter and peanut butter with chocolate and have also found the chocolate taste very subtle. Haven't decided whether I will buy this again."
cook mama,Nice to have these organic fruit strips.  My kids love them and they are a healthy snack.  I give them at their lunch for an extra cookie treat.
Yunmmy Cookies,"I love this tasty ginger snapz cookies, so do all my non-GF friends.<br />Thanks again Pamela's.<br />Don Mueller"
great food!,"My kitty eats all the flavors of Natural Balance Platefulls on rotation, and loves all of them equally. He gets dry food in the morning, and a pouch for dinner every night. His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad breath like some other canned/pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables. To my surprise, the bowl was licked clean! And after 3 months, he still licks the bowl clean every night!"
great training tool,"I use these to train my dog.  As others have pointed out, they smell awful.  Dogs love them though.  Not a lot of calories so you don't have to worry about your dog getting fat and sluggish either.  In fact, I break them up into two parts to get the most out of the bag."
"Wakes you up, maybe a bit too much","I drink a strong black cup most mornings, thought I'd give Jet Fuel a try.  One thing is this is a strong cup of coffee.  It may be too much for me since I drink it black.  The first thing I noticed when I pulled one of the K cups off the brewer is that there wasn't an aroma like I was used to with other K cups, which translated to little smell in the cup.  The flavor is strong and bitter, like I say it wakes you up.  Not one to sit and enjoy in my mind.  I prefer the other bold coffees available in K cups to this one.  They at least have an aroma and taste of coffe vs. this one that has bitterness to offer."
Excellent light flavored olive oil.  I recommend it.,After returning from Italy I wanted to find a better one than I had been using.  This one is it!
better than cream of wheat,"I used to love Cream of Wheat (wheat farina) as a kid. But over the years I've developed an intolerance to wheat products. I saw this the other day at Sprouts and picked it up on a whim, and I'm sure glad I did. Its delicious. I even like it a little better than Cream of Wheat because it has a little more texture to it.<br /><br />I make mine with water, cook it for 5-6 minutes, than add some organic half&half, sugar, and cinnamon and then stir for a couple more minutes with the heat off to thicken it. By the way, cinnamon doesn't just add flavor but also aids in the stabilizing of blood sugar levels when added to high carb foods so I highly recommend trying it. A bowl of this along with a side of 2 eggs over-easy and some OJ and I'm in breakfast heaven! I intend to try this sweetened with blackstrap molasses one of these days, I'll add an  update if I do. If it tastes good with BSM, that would be one powerhouse of a breakfast."
Tastes Great - 10 Calorie Treat,"This is the best tasting Sugar FREE drink for a K-Cup I have tried.  I used the medium setting for my brewer adn got a very good cup; there is no aftertaste at all.  This is a fresh apple caramel with a hint of cinnamon.  I have had real apple cider that tasted about the same.  This is a treat that even a  diabetic could go for and enjoy.  I am not sure why there are so many 1 star reviews, but i really do disagree.<br /><br />10 cal (0 fat)  --  0g fat sat  --  1 carb  --  0g sugar  --  &lt;1g fiber"
Taste Great and Very refilling,"I really like this banana bread bar. It's very tasty and refilling. The texture of Lalabar is different from all other bars I had before. It's soft, full of fruits, dates and almonds. I would like to purchase again this product!"
delicious and quick!,Easy for on the go. I've been wanting to try it but it's a little pricey for instant coffee. I bought it here because there was a special so it was a good time to try it.
Awesome healthy snack!,"I like these so much I enrolled in the Subscribe & Save over a year ago.  It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt."
A gourmet's delight!,"For any gourmet cook who wants to please his/her holiday guests, this chestnut puree is at the heart of a classic Buche de Noel!"
Morning coffee,I use this as my morning coffee wake up call.  I continue to re-order it because I like the medium roast flavor.
"Great chips, but...","I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!"
Best sour cream & onion chip I've had,"I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag."
"Great Coffee, has become our daily cup",A great simple and smooth brew of coffee. We have made this our daily choice for coffee. Would recommend as a great cup to start out with on the Vue.
dripping in oil,"I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others."
Grown to really like them,"My sister introduced me to these. They have become my favorite carry around pick me up bar.<br />A little greasy on the outside but very satisfying, energizes me in a nice steady way.<br />Our favorite flavors are choc/coconut and Cashew."
Fresh,"This was very good, fresh perfect flavor good size, packed well and received quickly. Not too moist, not too dry and perfect chew. A+"
good flavor,"Arrived in timely matter. Has great flavor. wish it had better way to dispense, but still a great product. I will be ordering more soon."
Lundberg Honey Dijon Rice Chips are the Best!!!,"These are the only chips I can eat since I have food allergies to wheat, gluten, milk, soy, etc.  That doesn't leave me much to eat and I hated to give up my chips.  Then I found these chips and I absolutely love them!!!!  I order them by the case (12 bags) and they last me quite awhile."
BAKER'S BUDDY,I love the convience of this buttermilk powder. I use it in all my baking and with wonderful results!  Much more economical than real buttermilk and stores a whole lot longer.
Awesome product but dented cans!,"These beans are heavenly and we love them, so we thought we would start a subscription for them to be delivered to us.  Unfortunately, when I opened the box and the plastic packaging inside, there were three seriously dented cans in the middle of the set of cans.  I find it hard to believe that they have gotten that dented where they were placed in the center of the set of cans without messing up all the cans around them unless they were set in there that way, so we paid for 12 cans and end up with only 9 usable cans.  Unless I find a way to get the other three cans to replace these I will be canceling the subscription and not buying this brand any more.<br /><br />It is too expensive in our local health food store, and we thought this would be a great idea. Since we got three unusable cans it ends up being too expensive again.  Too bad since it's a wonderful product my whole family loves."
gum balls found,"I finally found a source for gum balls to load into my old penny gum ball machine.  now it is more than just a twenty pound curiosity sitting on my desk.  at a penny a shot, though, it surely won't make me rich!!!"
I hate this tea,"It does cause you to have more bowel movements.<br />But causes stomach cramps after 7 days and blood in stool.<br />Do not recommend you drink this more than few days.<br /><br />Anybody want to buy some sealed boxes, only used the first one?"
Small Jars and a Little Runny - like most commercial baby foods,"Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much ""fuller"", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend!"
Sweet Potato PopChips are Sweeeeet!,"I think Sweet potato is the best flavor that Popchips offers.  They have the lowest sodium without sacrificing taste.  Not only do I love them, but my son loves them.  And he is hard to please.  Very healthy alternative to fried chips."
Disappointing,"Thought this was like the seasoning they have in the local theater her.  Wrong.  Just not very good tasting overall.  Compared it with Kroger brand here at the Ralphs market, and Kroger is much better for less money.  Live and learn.  By the way, I went back to the theater and noted the brand they use, it's ""Kernel Seasons"".  That's the best."
light peach drink,"My first batch was a little too flavored, but Red Leaf was glad to replace it, which I am very thankful for. With the right flavoring, it's still not one of my favorites, but that could be previous memories of the taste. Peach blends well with the flavor of matcha, though, so it is a very enjoyable drink overall. Be careful with the temperature of water you use to avoid it becoming bitter, and definitely try it cold with just a touch of sweetener!"
"Great fragrance, disappointing when brewed","I love the smell when I open one of these foil pouches - whatever one thinks of the coffee, they have packed a great smell in every bag.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I normally like dark roasts. I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak. I don't know if there is too little coffee in the bod, or if the pouch material isn't as effective as others - but something's not quite right here.<br /><br />So: 4 stars for fragrance and berry notes, 2 stars for the pouch material, 3 stars if you like mild roasts."
Omega 3  where are you?,"That's right. Just taste these Sockeye salmon. It's true I never had Sockeye Salmon before because of the price. I always bought the pink salmon (which is not bad) but the taste of the Sockeye Salmon is wonderful. So, wait for the monthly sale in grocery or if you can't try them you won't be disappointed . Taste, Taste, Taste Retired Early"
This is Authentic Scandinavian Marsipan,"This is authentic Scandinavian marsipan imported from Denmark.  This is one of the best brands.  If you have ever had a truly good marsipan cake with the marsipan rolled out in a thin layer like dough to cover the cream, this is the type of marsipan used."
A little odd....,"The price was right at the time I ordered them, but they were oddly stale-tasting despite being well within their ""best-by"" date. That said, the office was still grateful when I distributed them, so I suppose they fulfilled their function."
Awesome - works as advertised,Much much better than red bull or anything like that. You are awake and *alert* versus just having your heart pumping faster (due to influx of caffeine) and still being drowsy in your mind. Nothing bad to say about it.
Energy,Nom Nom Nom....yum! I love this stuff.  I didn't buy the real Energy drink because the price was repugnant.  This stuff tastes better than that canned stuff! Nom Nom Nom.....  ;-)
Just as I remember,One day I had a craving for these. I found them here and ordered. They are just as good as I remember. Pure flavored gooey sugar! So great to taste it again.
The best Kim Chee Sauce,"I've looked every where for this and finally went to where I trust online...Amazon.  It arrived, quickly, safely.  This makes the best, hands down kim chee honest."
Not the same Vernors from my childhood in the late 1950's. Not even close!!,"This is still better than Canada Dry.  When I lived as a child in the Detroit area (mid 1950's through about 1963 Vernors was available only in the greater Detroit area and southeastern Michigan.  You never forget the taste of your favorite soda as a kid, and I hahven't forgotten what Vernors USED to taste like.  About 12 years ago I found it here in California.  But it is next to impossible to find, and with most stores it's an on and off again availability situation!  However I just opened a can of regular Vernors a few minutes ago and am reminded that the formula has changed DRASTICALLY.  Mostly it's MUCH MUCH weaker tasting than when I was a kid.  It's mostly plain soda water... with only a HINT of the original Vernors than it was 50 years ago.  I still like it, but am VERY disappointed that since vernors was taken over at least twice over the years, that the owner has chosen to weaken the flavoring CONSIDERABLY.  Maybe they will see the light.,, but that is extremely unlikely considering who owns it now.  Vernors was I believe only second in sales around Metro Detroit (Coca Cola was first) 50 years ago. The reason I rated it at 1 star is because it's so MUCH weaker now. It originally used an extremely secret recipie that was truly in a high security vault.  Also it is NOW artificially flavored which means the entire formula has changed except for the fact they still use water! That is the only similarity vernors still has with the original formula. Perhaps the new owners have thrown away the old recipie.  It (was) the oldest soda made in America.  I say ""was"" because the REAL Vernors no longer exists."
Coffee Cost Conscious?,"This isn't my favorite dark roast coffee;  but it is quite good enough to warrent looking  forward to in the morning.<br />And it is such a bargain it has made me ask myself whether my ""favorites"" are worth the extra dollars.  It's on my subscription."
Relaxing,This tea works for me.  It calms down my anciety and makes me sleep better.  It may not work for everyone.  Thank you!
These are allergy friendly??????????????,"These chocolate chips are friggin AMAZING.  You are never sure when you get allergy friendly foods how they are going to taste, but these are so tasty.  My wife got these since our daughter has allergies, but she has outgrown the allergies and we still buy these chocolate chips because they are so good."
Better than anything,"Most dogs I've had have no problem taking pills, except for my yorkie, very obstinant.  It is a whole lot easier just to pop her meds in one of these, and we are both happier for it.  These are great.  End of struggles, she doesn't try to hide from me at pill time.  What could be greater.  The price is worth it!"
Sole reason I purchased a $200.00+ coffee maker,I have a friend and antique shop owner who I normally visit weekly and like others I stop by even if I know I am not going to purchase a thing solely for this coffee. With the holidays coming around I became so busy I was unable to get my fix so I broke down and bought a machine for my home that was approximately $230.00 here on Amazon. I am addicted to both the Breville machine and this amazing blended tea. It is not overly sweet or artificial tasting. It is the BEST!
Nutiva Coconut Oil,"This is great stuff, can be used in cooking as a healthy alternative to butter or other oil. I also use it as a base for skin creams. It's a great product, and the price was incredible, even with shipping it was cheaper than buying it from my local health food store."
Excellent gift for a tea connoisseur,This was the perfect present for a friend who loves tea (and already has a lot of favorites to drink).  And the lovely box is an excellent extra.  I saw similar sets elsewhere that were much more expensive.  I hope Amazon gets more in because this is my new favorite gift to give!
Excellent Coffee,"If you enjoy grinding your coffee beans, try this coffee (whole bean.)<br />I usually blend four kinds of beans. This was a good purchase.<br />Will probably come back for more of this brand soon."
Love these!,"I was hesitant to purchase this at first because I thought it might turn out too thick and taste nasty. But I decided for a few dollars, it was worth giving it a shot. I'm so glad I did! It tastes exactly like strawberry milk and it's a great breakfast substitute for anyone who would normally rather skip that meal. I've also heard it's great for getting more nutrients and calories in children that don't like to drink milk or eat much."
An addiction,"Acacia honey really is a different experience entirely. You know that taste your mind conjures up when imagining a perfect food, but nothing has quite satisfied that thought yet?  Well, this is it. And I don't even like honey. It should be called something else because it defies its category!  Light, airy, golden, buttery...even hard to describe!"
Great product,"My 18 month old son is allergic to dairy and egg and legumes, so we have a hard time finding foods that have the nutrition he needs. I gave him this vegan mac and ""chreese"" tonight and he LOVED it. And, as a vegan, I thought it was good too. It is not super flavorful, but satisfying none-the-less. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to buy it."
Buy it at the local market for 99c!!,"Did you guys know that this product is sold at the 99c store?? I hope you are not buying it here, because the price is even higher than the regular grocery store that sell it for around $2.00 each!  This is highway robbery!  The cake is amazing in taste and texture though! :)"
I am definitely buying this again,"I got these to make as a surprise gift for my son.  The kit came with everything I needed including the marshmallows.  The directions were super easy, and they turned out FANTASTIC!  The jar of sprinkles they give you is huge, we still have half of them left over but BE CAREFUL WHEN OPENING IT!!! I popped the top off and tiny little sprinkle dots went all over my kitchen.  Let me tell you, those things are NOT easy to sweep up.  The only other issues I had were that there was only enough melted chocolate to make 10 pops, not 12 and I didnt realize I was going to need wax paper or a drying rack for them but that was an easy fix.  I took the box that amazon sent them to me in, flipped it upside down and covered it with aluminum foil.  Then I poked 12 holes in the box with a meat thermometer and sprayed the foil with some cooking spray so the pops wouldnt stick to it.  After coating each pop in chocolate and sprinkles I stuck the stick in one of the holes I had made in the box and it worked perfectly.  They did take about 3-4 hours to completely harden but after that I just stuck them in a ziplock baggie and stored them in my cabinet. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to make a special treat for their loved ones, or a fun project to do with the kids.  In the store or in a bakery these puff pops cost $2 or more EACH!!!! I was amazed at the value I got with this product in comparison with similar products.  DEFINITELY add these to your cart shoppers!  You wont be sorry."
Interesting delicately spicy alternative spread,"Wow, I saw Laxmi's lemony flaxseed spread with ginger at the grocery and thought I would try it because it sounded so unusual.  I am glad I did!  The spread is delicious, wonderful on crackers or bread, offering a wonderful light Indian spiced flavor.  It's a little expensive, but a little goes a long way and I am glad that I have a new addition to my appetizer / snack / light meal options."
Excellent,Alprose Swiss Dark Chocolate Parve bar is the best tasting and excellent Parve chocolate that I ever ate and it also is great to use in baking!!
BEST COCONUT CHIPS EVER !!!!!!!!!!!,"You get what you pay for!<br />These are the best tasting coconut chips ever created.The flavor is intense without being tooo sweet.Once you try these you will become addicted and will be a repeat customer forever.Don't forget to try the other choices in the line-up, you will be equally pleased."
Great Northern 12oz Popcorn Packs,This product was recieved on time and in excellent condition. It is also a great tasting product that our family loves and enjoys.
A treat that is good for the teeth,I have a two year old chihuahua mix.My vet shared with me that I would have to be vigilant about the health of my Pups teeth.Greenies help keep my dogs teeth clean and his breath fresh. And best of all my Pups loves them above all other treats.
"excellent, healthy dogfood",I was looking to change my dog's canned food as he is getting on in years and I wanted a more nurtitious healthy brand than what I was currently using. My dog loves this food and eats it heartily. I feel better knowing he is eating an organic food from a company I trust...I would recommend it highly. I also signed up to receive automatic delivery which saves money. With that discount this is the least expensive pricing I have been able to find.
Great Value & Fast Ship!,"This is the first time I've ever bought food items through Amazon and I'm really impressed. Each package of rice flour would have cost me at least $5 + tax at my grocery store, and I was able to get these so much cheaper & delivered to my door in only 2 days! Very convenient & inexpensive!"
already reviewed it!,"already reviewed it! i know the product , service and pricing were excellent . . ."
great for training,"These have a great smell for my dog, he loves them and they are working VERY well with ""heel"". They are a great size too, because we do a lot of training and the smaller the treat the better."
Delicious!,"I'm looking forward to the cost of this stuff to come down, but I will say that the Spry gum is pretty competitively priced with all the other xylitol brands of gum out there. I've tried some others... including Epic Dental's version.  I like the taste of Spry the best... my kids really like it too, and the taste seems to last about average for gum. I'd give it a 5-star rating if it wasn't for the high price."
Wonderful snack,"Love the combination of crunchy, sweet, and salty.  Only thing missing to satisfy all snack cravings is chocolate."
Beanitos,Health food and beer food in one package.  My new favorite snack.  Over use can lead to shall we say...bloating.
BEST EVER,The best treats available. Your dogs will go bonkers for these. I buy a tub a month for my little munchkins and they just love it. Good value online.
no better way to hydrate,"now these obviously aren't as flavorful as fresh young coconuts but vitacoco's flavor is the best among the coconut waters on the market (zico & o.n.e. just don't compare) and it contains more electrolytes.  you really feel the difference when you hydrate with this rather than water or other sports drinks & it's great to stock up on in preparation for those mornings when you wake up under the weather.  my only gripe would be that the container is less travel-friendly because the lid isn't particularly secure, but as long as you're not throwing your bag around, you shouldn't have an issue."
"Not Bad for the Price, but...",Not bad taste and the price is a third of Nespresso brand capsules but these get stuck in my Essenza. Have to pry them out with a sharp knife. I've also tried Indiad'oro flavor which tastes better and don't seem to stick in the machine as often. The price is still worth the extra effort.
"great cracker, okay packaging","In this day and age of portion-controlled snacks (like 100 calorie packs), this is a great idea, but one fresh pack is basically two servings, so I still ended up putting the open pack in a zipper bag. So next time I'll just buy a regular package and portion it out myself. The crackers were excellent though, light and crispy, perfectly tasty!"
Good cracker,"Nice cracker, good price, quick ship. This is a crispy, flavorful, whole grain organic product that I have no complaints about except, as with all of these online food products, they may or may not make it to you without breaking some of the crackers. Still, you'll break 'em when you eat 'em so what's the problem????"
I love this stuff! Yummy!,My mom used to make this custard when I was a kid.  It is great on pies.  Just like I remembered.
Yuck -- couldn't finish,"Well I'm mystified.  I received a can of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink</a> to review and loved it.  Good expresso flavor with a hint of cocoa and not too sweet.  BUT the plain Illy Issimo caffe drink... yuck.  It had a metallic taste and I couldn't even finish half of it.<br /><br />You would think quality would be more consistent across lines, but I'll be buying the Cappuccino and avoiding this product.<br />Pam T~"
Nasty!,"I did not think it would be so nasty. Now I am stuck with a bunch of this powder, and the only use i can find is baking where you cant really tell the difference."
"OK, not that flavorful","The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be."
Okay for the price but not the best.,I have tried many different brands of gunpowder green tea and this brand is average.  Not the worst but definitely not the best.  For the price it is pretty good but I was a bit disappointed.  I had really hoped it would be better.  It's not as strong tasting as some gunpowder green teas I've tried ; some people may like that.  I would not get this item again but instead will keep looking for something better.
Got the job done,These are very colorful but not the best tasting. I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn't want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there....the look was great. I'm sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all.
Exotic Sounding,"My primary reason for looking at unconventional salts was not for any kind of magical healing powers, but because I've learned how bad chemically processed salts are for you.<br /><br />I'm all for marketing even if it makes your product sound like it came right from the heavens... but I'm also for doing your own research.<br /><br />""Himalayan Salts"" don't come from the mountains themselves... instead it typically comes from Pakistan a few hundred miles away.  That's not to necessarily say the mineral deposits wouldn't have come from the mountains, but it sounds a lot less exotic when you find it's the same stuff that's used to salt the roads over there.<br /><br />There are a lot of varying reports on Himalayan salt... many suggesting that it is indeed high in lots of great minerals, but any balanced report seems to suggest it's also be high in other stuff you don't want too much of, such as fluoride....  The supposed ancient lake this salt came from is from the dinosaur age, but just look what happened to them ;).<br /><br />I'm not sure what to believe now, but when I realized I was wasting way too much time I decided I'd just switch to French Gray Sea Salt also sold by the Spice Lab... If you check The Spice Lab's website, they've actually got a link to their supplier in France who seems to have been around for hundreds of years harvesting salt the old fashioned way free of any chemical/artificial processing... Many of their workers have even been in the salt harvesting industry for many generations.  Sounds good to me, much less fairy tail like.  In comparison, I watched a video online about Himalayan salts and the lady said it was important that Himalayan Salts be removed by hand to preserve it's good vibrations....<br /><br />I'm positive that this Himalayan salt is many times better than ordinary table salt, and it tastes great too!  But to best accomplish what I set out to do, I think the French Gray Salt sounds like a no-nonsense quality product that fits the bill."
"Tasty, but very small","These bars have a fairly good taste to them, and have a texture that makes them almost like a chewy nut-based candy bar; they are very sticky.  If you're sensitive to salty peanuts, I don't recommend these since that is the dominant taste. In fact, I couldn't taste the raisins in them at all.<br /><br />These come in at 200 calories,  12 grams of fat (18% of your daily value), 230 mg of sodium (10%), 18 grams of carbs (6%), 5 grams of fiber (20%), 9 grams of sugar, and 7 grams of protein.<br /><br />While I do like these, I'm giving them 3 1/2 stars for a few reasons. First of all, this is an awfully tiny bar for 200 calories.  I know that nut bars (Larabars come to mind, too) tend to have more calories than non-nut-based bars, but these are very tiny.  Additionally, while they are billed as using organic peanuts, in the list of ingredients, about half of the ten main ingredients are not organic, including the peanut flour and peanut butter that are added in addition to the actual peanuts.  It seems misleading to use organic peanuts, but not organic PB.<br /><br />For a vegan bar, these are tasty, but I don't see myself purchasing a box after I run out of my first box."
excellent!!!,"If you like salt and vinegar chips and are looking for a healthier alternative, you have got to try these! They are absolutely addicting."
This is a big hit at parties.  You can premix a pitcher and serve frozen or on the rocks.,This mixer has a light lime flavor with no chemical taste or aftertaste.  It is best with a gold tequila.  The bottle is attractive so it makes a great hostess gift.  You can order a case.  Some retail stores are starting to carry it too.
Very good,I'd been trying to find an onion soup mix w/o a lot of chemicals & preservatives. I bought this to try it & have been very please w/ it. Would buy again.
bagel chips,Very good product.  Nice and crunchy.  Nicely seasoned.  Very happy with all the Stacy's products I have eaten.
Doggone Delicious Dog Treats!!!,"Well, I can't really say that first hand...but my GSD/Husky, Jake, seems to adore them!  He's proven himself a fairly picky eater when it comes to dog treats. Even the 5-star rated goodies have received an upturned nose from this pooch.  The Blue Dog Bakery treats are definitely an exception. They are sizeable morsels, but can be easily broken down when used for training.  They come in assorted flavors and all of them seem to strike a chord with Jake.  You can practically see the smile on his face, the swagger in his step, and the sway of his tail when he knows he's getting one of these morsels from Heaven. OK, I may be overstating it, but these are truly some dynamic dog treats that Jack and I would highly recommend to most the finnicky canine!"
very nice blend,"I am quite pleased with the aroma and flavor of this tea.  Hopefully it will help with the ""fat burning"" as said on Dr. Oz.  If not I still enjoy the tea so I would definitely buy again."
Delicious product,Post seems to have discontinued this product much to my disappointment.  I really don't care for the other flavors of Honey Bunches of Oats so will no longer be a customer.  I simply do not understand why such a good product was shipcanned.
Great tasting cereal,"While I cannot comment on how much this cereal increased my performance or kept me healthy, I can say one thing for sure: this is one of the best tasting cereal I've had."
I like this stuff a lot,I like ion4.  I use it when I work out and then go play basketball or something so that the total time spent working out is over 2-3 hours.  I like the taste more than the regular stuff.  I don't know if it makes a bigger impact but I believe it does.
10 of 12 cans badly damaged!,"Hard to rate higher a tasty soup when my purpose is to warn you that this is the second time this particular soup has arrived badly dented - so much so that it was dangerous to open.  One order had 10 of 12 cans unusable! The other order was from several months ago and had 4 of the 12 badly dented.  Sorry to say that we won't be ordering this again even tho' the price is so good compared to at the local foodstore.As always, Amazon came through with their promise to serve the customer fairly and well. They refunded the order with no hiccups! Thank you Amazon. I will continue to order items that are not so ""iffy"" regarding shipping care."
"Very tasty, but heavy on the cloves","I am a huge fan of rooibos tea, and I drink at least three cups a day. I was really looking forward to trying this rooibos blend with fruit and spices. The first cup I tried was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of cloves. I like cloves, but not to the exclusion of everything else. After the first cup, I examined the remaining sachets. Each one had at least one whole clove, and some had as many as five cloves, which is cloverkill for one cup of tea!<br /><br />Not wanting to toss the remaining teabags, I ended up opening the fabric sachets and removing the offending cloves, and using the tea loose. For me, that wasn't a problem, but if you don't have the gear for dealing with loose tea (a strainer or a tea ball), it might be a deal breaker.<br /><br />With the cloves removed, the tea was delightful. The flavor of the rooibos was accented by a bit of apple and spice flavor that enhanced but did not overwhelm the flavor of the tea."
Outstanding Earl Grey,"Our family drinks a lot of tea(daily)and we have been using Market Spice Earl Grey Tea for over 7 years. Our three-year-old loves it. We serve High-Tea often and use this product to introduce our guest to the world of tea. It is an excellent tea and one we have received a lot of complements on.<br /><br />We favor adding cream and sugar; however, it can be drank staight also. This is a highly recommended tea!"
Meyer Lemon Olive Oil,This is an excellent product at a great price.  I have been ordering it for several years and hope they never discontinue it.  I have also referred friends to this product from this site.
YUM!,"These M&Ms are truly  yummie! I would like to see them available in smaller packages, but it's not a big deal.  I couldn't find them anywhere in the stores and was really happy to find them on Amazon.  Thanks, Amazon!"
Good mush,"The ingredients seem good quality, although nothing is recognizable in the can, like with Merrick.  It's great for mixing with kibble to moisten it and if your dog needs mush--soft wet, canned food."
Sweet!,"If you are looking for sugar floss for your cotton candy machine, this is it!  Good price and a very satisfactory product.  The vanilla flavor is just kind of a neutral flavor that makes the cotton candy taste like cotton candy should.  We like it and will likely re-order when the time comes, unless my daughter moves on from her current cotton candy obsession."
Product was great; Amazon packaging not so great,"The product was pretty much as I expected - great!  The packaging, or should I say repackaging by Amazon, left a lot to be desired.  I purchased a package of 24 yet only received 23.  I guess it must be a new Federal Tax but I just can't see the Obamination eating biscuits and gravy with his filet mignon."
Best one yet,"I have tasted a couple of other varieties of the Pu-erh tea and found this to be excellent in taste and body. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to purchase this tea. The price, color and taste are excellent. Amazon has included a fantastic purchase with this tea in their lineup."
Deadman's Breath,"I also ordered this coffee based on the amount of positive reviews. This coffee taste pretty bad for a dark roast. Bitter, not smooth. Will never order again."
"If not for Annie, I'd starve!","I love many of Annie's products, but of all the skillet dinners, this one is my favorite. :) This particular dinner is made even better by the substitution of one can of low sodium V8 for part of the water that is called for in the directions. It gives this skillet more of a ""tomatoey"", pasta sauce flavor, and adds a little extra zip. It also seems that a full pound of ground beef is a bit much, so I only use half a pound. One word of warning though, this particular flavor is downright inedible when prepared with ground turkey. All in all, a tasty, quick dinner that even the domestically challenged such as myself can pull off!"
Caffeine free herb tea that's a black tea substitute,"This tea satisfies my desire for an herbal black tea with no caffeine .  I put milk and honey in it, and it tastes like the real thing, and yet doesn't interfere with my sleep.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OJW"">Celestial Seasonings Caffeine-Free Herb Tea with Roasted Chicory, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
So disappointing,The plant I received was nothing like the photo.  There is only one limb instead of the 3-4 shown.<br />Thus it is not worth as much as the one in the photo.  Not such a good buy.  It WAS in good shape and<br />seems to like my home.  Will see if it lasts long enough to grow the missing branches.
really good stuff and non-fat too!,"Hard to beat this cocoa.  Taste great, and is non-fat.  Might even be good for you."
CATNIP,"After several attempts to engage my aged cat with this catnip I finally filled an old nylon stocking with it.  Now that she can smell it more intensely she is quite content.  I love to watch her doze off.  Slowly the eyes close, then the head drops, the lips may or may not part, the tongue may or may not protrude, but always the head drops until her chin sits on her stocking filled with catnip.  I think it may be equally entertaining for me.<br /><br />A side note:  Until recent years, and still in many part of the world, people have drunk catnip tea (usually in the afternoons) for its relaxing qualities. It is a member of the mint family and quite safe.  It can also be used as a mint would be used in foods."
Better than expected,I looked all over for the Limone Biscotti after receiving a few at Christmas.  Unfortunately you can only get them in a combination package or in limited quantities.  So this opportunity to purchase a case was perfect.  My entire office enjoys having these biscotti with their morning tea or coffee.  You can't beat Nonni's.
My son loves it!,My son gobbles up the veg and pasta every time I give it to him. One review said it's to thick but you could always add a little water to thin it out if you need to. This is a great meal to help transition your baby into eating more table foods eventually.
Absolutely the Best Gummi Bears,"Delicious!!  These are cost effective and perfect for when I have a sweet tooth.  I travel a lot so I put a handful of these in a ziplock bag and throw it in my briefcase.  Perfect for a snack now and then.<br /><br />If you buy these at the airport at the nut stand - you'll literally get a handful for $10 no joke.  This way, you'll get 5 pounds for that price.<br /><br />Also, these bears are very good - the best ones I've ever had.  They're not soft and squishy but harder yet chewy.  Very good!"
Hasn't attracted any wasps so far...,"ugh, we put it right by the yellow jacket nests-near the eaves-and hasn't caught one so far and it's been quite awhile now."
"tastes like the fruit, delicious","These gummies are the most delicious I have tasted. Compared to their American counterparts, these are practically the real fruit. Their flavor is fresh and bright, and they taste just like the real thing, but with that fun gummy texture.<br />The lychee gummies are no exception. They have the aroma and pleasant aftertaste the fruit has with the hint of tanginess--they taste a hint more like the fresh kind than the canned, for those of you that have had both."
Great pub snack,"I first had these in a pub in Ireland.  Once I got home to the states I just had to have them so I decided to order them through amazon.  It took a month for them to finally arrive but it was worth the wait.  They are a great, bacon flavored snack that you will just love!"
Incorrect description,"I am certain that this company is well-meaning.  Unfortunately, I am out $50.  The capsules are clearly not compatible and should not be marketed as compatible with Nespresso.  I liked the idea that I read, but they absolutely do not work.  You may not get a refund, either.  Do not buy this product."
awesome treat,"these spiced nuts are awesome... I especially love the ones with cranberries, pepper and orange sauce"
Despite Title- this item is NOT Beef and Ocean Fish Formula,"Upon receiving my order for the Canidae Beef and Ocean Fish Formula 30 lbs I found I instead received ANOTHER formula (the original formula with chicken, turkey, etc.).  If you look at the picture and ingredients you'll see that Amazon has a picture AND the ingredients for the formula I received.  The bag I received was 35 lbs and not 30.  Clearly Amazon made a boo-boo here somewhere.  My dogs have eaten this formula and I believe Canidae is a pretty good and nutritious formula so I'm not sending it back.  However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.  I've found it good palatable food for the money, and I'd bet Canidae won't make the mistake of a secret formula change again."
...,"While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee. I was pretty disappointed."
My dog goes crazy for these!,"My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them."
BEWARE: terrible flavor of usually good product line,"It looks as if the previous reviews are all for Pill Pockets in general, which are a great product for dogs.  This flavor variety, though, is horrible, judging by the packet I was sent.<br /><br />I opened the package, and they smelled exactly like (forgive the imagery) diarrhea.  And strongly.  I thought someone had had an accident until I realized where it was coming from.<br /><br />I thought maybe it was a flavor dogs like. You never know.  Some cheese smells bad too.  My poor dog spit it out and gagged when I fed it to him.<br /><br />This is either a very misguided flavor attempt, or the completely sealed package somehow went rotten (not a good sign), or they filled it with rotten product at the packaging stage (also not reassuring).<br /><br />Sickening, horrible, unfit to be put in the trash.  Had to flush it."
Jack Link's Original,Healthy treat for dogs and grandchildren.  I use them for training both.  Good behavior merits a Jack Link.  Give them a try.
Not that great.,"I have to say that I was disappointed in the quality of chocolate in this basket. I purchased it to give as a gift but when it arrived there was more shredded paper than product, so I kept it and bought something else for our friends. I'm glad I did because the chocolate was ""waxie"" tasting and did not have a pronouced, rich, deep chocolate flavor one would expect from a company with the reputation Godiva has. The only thing worth while in the basket were the coffee mugs.  Do yourself a favor and buy some See's, Fannie May's or Rocky Mountain Chocolates instead."
Great cereal!,"If you're looking for a healthy and ""heart smart"" cereal, this could be it.  As a cold cereal, the flakes are tasty and crunchy.  The blueberry/kash clusters are also nice, adding texture and flavor, although I find that they float to the bottom of my bowl midway through.  I usually eat this with just milk for breakfast or to fuel a midday jog, but I've also been known to eat it right out of the box when I'm hungry and need something healthy to eat ASAP!<br /><br />The taste is slightly sweet without going overboard and could use a few more blueberries per serving, but I add my own.  This cereal is not, unfortunately, organic, as other items in the Kashi line are.  But it's still a great selection for a quick meal any time of the day!<br /><br />As for best prices on this product, I do NOT support Wal-Mart regardless of how low their prices are.  Whole Foods tends to be the most expensive, of course, and I've seen this elsewhere for about $3.49 per box.  Because it's Kashi, it won't be cheap but it's a good addition to your diet if you can afford it."
"Not good, not good at all.","When I got my basket I couldn't believe it was so old and beyond staleness that they actually sent it that way.  Everything in the basket was a WASTE OF MONEY.  Nothing I've got was no good, not good at all, you couldn't eat any of it. But prepared by a national known chocolate company Ghirardelli that supposed to be great chocolate, it doesn't surprise me they don't even check to see if it's any good to eat anyway.just to save money.  It only reenforces one thing for me when it comes to chocolate: stick to Hershey's, at least they give a damn."
A total waste.,"I got these salmon flavored pill pockets since my cat goes crazy for salmon flavored wet cat food, but she hates these things. First I tried giving them to her as a treat without any medicine in them, she took one sniff and backed away, then I put one in her food once again with no medicine, she wouldn't even touch the food it was sitting on, apparently she would rather starve than eat these things, and this is a cat that will eat roadkill and bugs.  For me this was a waste of money."
Good!!,"This is such good stuff, and it's quite healthy. It contains plenty of trace nutrients as well which are vital to our everyday functions, such as eukronium and phosphoric acid. My kids love it! This brand should serve as an example to the rest of this industry."
good eating,"If you are a man this is the best you can do for your health, eat Pumpkin Seeds.  Bob's Red Mill has the best grown here in the good old USA.  The others are from China, enough said."
This stuff stinks literally!!!,"My cat Joshua is 13years old, he has been with me through thick and thin, good times bad times, you name it. When times were hard, he had to rough it with cat food from the ninety nine cents store, no complaints he ate it up. Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff."
"Good tasting, but not a good value.","Let me be clear, I thought the GoPicnic meals tasted good and were incredibly filling for the small amount of food in the kit. This is not to mention that the food provided is relatively healthy.<br /><br />My complaint comes in with the sheer cost of these meals. At around $4.16 per meal, this only becomes a good value only to those eating either very high-end foods or going out to eat for lunch every day. If you already take your lunch to school or work, chances are that your existing lunch is cheaper than it would be through GoPicnic.<br /><br />While Amazon gives a 15% discount and a $1.00 coupon, this still doesn't make it too much better. You're almost certainly better off buying hummus and crackers in bulk and portioning it out into lunches than by going this route. If you'd rather have convenience and don't mind paying a premium for it, then GoPicnic may be for you."
this doesn't really do anything for me,"I am a big white chocolate fan, my favorite candy bars have always been Hershey's Cookies n Creme and Halloween Kit Kats (its a white chocolate kit kat with food coloring to make the chocolate look orange for Halloween) they used to be the only way you could find white ones so this Halloween I went to buy a bag and I couldn't find the white chocolate Kit Kats but I found these instead, and being a white chocolate fan I thought these would be amazing, I didn't have a lot of money on me so I only bought one bag- I am glad I only bought one bag, they weren't all that great. I don't think white chocolate goes all that well with peanut butter, honestly I think its like serving chicken and putting out beef gravy for your mashed potatoes in one meal, or pairing your meat with the wrong kind of wine. I found out they sell white kit kats now and its not just a seasonal thing so I have gone back to buying them and wont get these again."
via,"We like to keep instant coffe on had to make a single cup, instead of having to make a pot of coffee.  This is the best instant coffee we have ever had.  It is more expensive, but you get what you pay for.  If you really enjoy good flavor and want the convience, I'd recommend Via.  It isn't quite as good as fresh brewed, but none of the instants are, but this is the best."
We do not recommend this gum!,"We share gum at work between 5 of us, so I decided to get creative and purchase the Spry five flavor pack. Big mistake...it had great flavor for about one minute, it looses it's flavor and is hard to chew. We are addicted to chewing gum and will continue our search for the best gum with xylitol. We will not purchase this gum again and do not recommend it to you!"
Use with caution,"We were eager to try this product, in a household with one diabetic and more than one person trying to lose weight.<br /><br />This product is intended to take the place of pasta or rice (depending on how it is cut) and is really a pretty decent substitute. Some people are put off by the appearance or odor when the package is opened, but you'll find after you rinse with water that there is really no odor and it is perfectly bland. It derives its taste and smell from whatever you add to it. In texture, it's more chewy than pasta, a bit hard to bite through and easy to choke on. Again, this can be overcome by choosing a kind that's been pre-cut into small pieces. As a substitute for pasta, you may not do any better than this.<br /><br />And now I must come to the reason I titled this review ""use with caution."" With one exception, everyone in my household liked this product but had severe stomach cramps within a couple hours of eating it. We're pretty hearty and not inclined to have easily upset tummies or food allergies. We liked this product and wanted to use it so we gave it several tries, but with the same result each time - severe stomach cramps within a short time after eating. We eat other foods that have a high fiber content with no difficulty.<br /><br />So - I wouldn't suggest avoiding this product, because many people eat it without a problem. I do recommend that you try it with caution and don't order a lot of it until you know that you're able to tolerate it."
Cool skinny cans,"We don't drink a lot of soda at our house but if it's there it goes pretty fast, so this looked like a healthier alternative.  The taste of the apple drink is similar to Martinelli's, although a bit more tart than sweet.  The can says they ""stay true to the fruit,"" and my wife's feeling was that it was perhaps a little *too true* to the fruit, but everyone liked it.  It is labeled as ""all natural,"" being just fruit juice, carbonated water, and added vitamins, but it's still rather high in calories and sugar.  The apple drink is actually mostly white grape juice according to the ingredients listed.  My only complaint (which is perhaps too strong of a word) is the high price and the small size of the cans (about 8 oz), but the kids thought the skinny cans were cool."
Waaay too salty for me,This blend has way too much salt.  It has 310mg of sodium in just 1 tsp of this stuff!  Everything I've cooked so far using this has come out tasting way to salty - I keep needing to add other ingredients just to balance the salt.
To Life !!!,"Sun Maid pitted plums (or, prunes) are the best brand of pitted and dried plums on your grocer's shelf--period. These dried pitted plums are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They contain sugar (12 grams per serving) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />In addition, a few of these helps fight constipation really well! Don't eat too many--you'll have stomach trouble--trust me!<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these pitted plums are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that they do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily. In my personal opinion, I love to refrigerate these and eat them cold. They are remarkably sweet, too.<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the container. Eat or use these before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These pitted plums are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Pitted Plums provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!"
Don't really care for the taste,"I love Crystal Light's Pure products that are sweetened with natural sweeteners (stevia). This one is sweetened with aspartame and I don't care for how that tastes - I'm not a fan of diet sodas, either. I really like fruit punch, but this just has a very artificial taste to it and does not feel refreshing to me when I drink it, although adding extra water and a lot of ice did help. They also used way too much red dye in it. It easily stains plastic containers and counter tops - I would dread getting it on clothing or carpet.<br />I do like Crystal Light products but will stick to the Pure from now on."
Very pleased,"Good size for my papillon and pomeranian-mix.  These are dense, not airy- so they last longer and from the USA."
YUMMM SNACK,"SnackWell's has always made a great low-fat treat and the Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is no exception. At first taste, I thought I was eating Cracker Jax with chocolate, and started digging through for my prize! While the package looks small, it's the perfect amount, and not too fudgy or over-the-top caramelly. A perfect afternoon snack for adults. I wouldn't share this one with the kids though -- keep these for yourself!"
Flavored cofffee?,I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.
Most irresistable dog treat ever,Every dog I know loves this. The dogs I train go nuts over these. Nice small size and very smelly (which is good for dog training).
An Old Family Recipe,"I have known the family who originated this recipe for many years, and have been fortunate to taste it in a wide range of uses, including salad dressing.  The uses for this salt are limited only by your imagination."
Will Order Again,Wonder how many women not like macadamia nut nor chocolate.  Wish dark chocolate is darker in cocoa content.  Have this regularly so I can only grab a few every time to satisfy the crave.
no more stomach problems,My golden retriever puppy had weeks of stomach problems and lots of expensive and unsuccessful testing to try to determine the problem. My puppy trainer suggested I try this grain free food. I did and his problems cleared right up. It is expensive but has all natural and healthy ingredients and should actually reduce vet bills in the long run since he is such a healthy dog now. I plan to start feeding my cat Fromm food now too. She likes the smell of the salmon in the dog's food so I'll try the salmon cat food soon. This company makes quality food for pets and produces it here in the United States.
"Good service, good product, poor utility","The service from this Amazon supplier was fast and efficient. The product was packaged well. The drawer is well made, operates smoothly, and, in my opinion is good value for the price. HOWEVER, please be aware of two drawbacks: the footprint of the drawer is quite big (cut the dimensions out of newspaper and put on the counter under your coffeemaker to visualize the space you will lose), and, fatally for my needs, the drawer raises the coffeemaker high enough under my (standard) top cabinets that I cannot fully raise the handle to insert the coffee pod. This product will not work if placed under cabinets."
Variety Pack,Not bad but not great either. My children of course love the cookies but when it comes to the crackers they just tell me they are extremely dry and pasty. You def. get a lot food for the money but when the children turn to them as the last resort snack when everything else is out... just doesnt make me want to repurchase.
This tea is wonderful!,"Smells strong, but the brew is a nice calming flavor that isn't too overpowering. I enjoy it both iced and hot. Not sure of the ""weight"" promises as I don't think it has had any effect for me. But a yummy tea no less!"
terrible taste,"I like rice cakes and all sorts of health food my husband would describe as cardboard, but this is probably one of the most unappealing things I've ever tasted. No, it does not compare to potato chips. I smells a little like gold fish food and I imagine the taste is not far off as this tastes terrible. However, my order was placed with vitacost.com and their service was good. This product even shipped 1 week earlier than expected."
too many chemicals/dyes,"I looked at the ingredients and it's a bunch of chemicals and dyes that I don't know whether they are safe or not (A Google search listed several of them as harmful, irritating or toxic)...and I won't continue using it. It also burns your eyes if you happen to get any in while rinsing.<br />Here are just some of the ingredients: cyclopentasiloxane, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, methylisothiazolinone, methylchloroisothiazolinone and the list goes on of all these chemical sounding ingredients."
It is Almond Extract,Read a lot of reviews complaining about the taste and odor of the product. I have to say....  The product we received looked and smelled like Almond extract. My wife used in her poppy seed bread and it was excellent!
Not just for cooking,"Cloves have many uses - they have an outstanding antibacterial properties and also anti-inflamatory properties as well as a refreshing quality.<br />You can put it on cuts, toothaches and even sprinkle it on your toothbrush when you brush your teeth.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with the flavor of these cloves, just be aware that ground cloves do not have as long a shelf life as whole cloves. Be sure to use by the 'Best By' date stamped on the bottom of the bottle which is quite generous.<br /><br />Also I have heard you can extend the shelf life by placing in the fridge."
Energy and Fat Burning super powder.,"There are many way in which to use this product.  This product helps to burn fat, increase lean muscle, and provide sustained energy.  The best protein powder. Use with a banana, vanilla extract, hemp milk, and shelled hemp seeds, blend and enjoy. mmm"
GREAT TASTE,"I am one of those persons that can not drink coffee in the afternoon if I want to have a good sleep. This coffee has great taste, not too strong, perfect for my afternoon drink. And the best part....I can go to sleep like a baby!"
Fast,When I Need a quick pick me up Senseo Expresso is the way to go!
vipsusie,Butterfinger hot chocolate is very good. It taste like a butterfinger candy bar. I like using it with my coffee for special treat. I get the satisfaction of the candy bar with a lot less calories and being warm/hot it is extremely comforting.
Yummy!,This makes a great lunch for taking to the office.  Just water and microwave and it's actually pretty tasty.
"Whether you're grown or growing, this is the YUMMIEST fruit snack going!","I'm not exactly a kid (born December 5, 1967, you do the math)but I had to try these things when I saw them in my local natural-foods market, and they are PLENTY OF YUMMY. Sweet yet zingy, fruity-fresh flavor, firm but tender texture. Each twist ""candy"" is 70 calories and 1 point on Weight Watchers, and unlike conventional fruit snacks, these take some time to enjoy, so they're more satisfying. These are a snack to be savored. Now I'm hooked on the things. I tried the Tropical Twist and the Mixed Berry so far (I like to buy them individually, so I don't mow through the box in one sweep!) Both are delish, but the Tropical Twist is an eyelash ahead. Looking forward to trying the other flavors.<br />  I don't have kids yet, but I would recommend them to my little cousin-nieces (my cousin's daughters)<br />  These are great to take on the go. Just slip into pocket or purse.<br />  A fitness-friendly, tastebud-tantalizing way to slap your mouth sideways with a wallop of fruit!  I recommend them highly"
Great flavored tea,"This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online."
"Smells good, but has a flavored coffee aftertaste","I was expecting the flavor of a chocolate glazed donut when you take a bite, but I forgot that this is really coffee. It does smell good, but it has an aftertaste that I'm not crazy about.<br /><br />I'm a person who doesn't like the instant General Mills? International Coffess that come in the rectangular cans. I've always described them as having a perfume-y flavor to them that is kind of fake in the aftertaste. So if you can relate to that, you'll understand what I mean.<br /><br />I think I will stick with different coffee blends and roasts that are natural and leave any flavoring to the creamers and other additions that I make to my cup of coffee."
South Beach Snack Bars.,"I really enjoy snacking on this product, I continue to purchase them. They are tasty, flavorful, and a great snack product. I've purchased several boxes and ordered three times."
Indulgent treat!,"This is a rich and indulgent cup of coffee, yet not overwhelming with strong artificial flavor as so many other are.  I have purchased many flavors and then don't want to finish the box, not so with this one.  It is definitely not my morning coffe, but rather the type you come home and brew after you've smelled and resisted a local Starbucks!  The main flavor is velvety rich coffee, with strong hints of raspberry and chocolate perfectly blended in.  I strongly recommend a ""cozy-up"" with a cup of this and a good book :)"
another great treat and it really works...,My one aussie was starting to get a tartar build-up on her teeth when I found this product.  They love them and I can notice a difference in my girls teeth.  The tartar build-up is less and less.  Thanks!
Best Kettle Chips!,"As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence!"
The best sea salt by far!,"Once you try Maldon sea salt, there truely is no going back.  I always thought, try one sea salt and you've tried them all.  NOT SO.  Maldon is the favorite of many professional chefs for a reason.  It's simply superior to all the others.  Tasting is believing."
LOVE IT,"The Marley coffee is the best aroma and taste. It provides a true coffee experience that lets you know this is special. Myself and family work long hours, so this is our reward every morning and evening. I provide my co-workers and clients the same Marley coffee with its 5 star experience."
Left My Hair Moisturized,"This shampoo works for leaving my hair feeling clean and moisturized, which is good, because I blow-dry a lot. It has a pleasant, soft apples-and-violets scent. (It reminds me of something from my childhood, but I can't quite remember what.) Don't be surprised when you see that the product is the same lavender color as the bottle."
Great cookie!,"This is one of my favorite cookies. Light, crispy and flavorful; a great snack without too much guilt.  I order them regularly."
we use it daily,"to save my time and yours - i've included a multi-item review<br />we love the idea of draining a dog's energy, stimulating their mind, giving them a fun challenge, and feeding them all in one. we have bought a lot of the products that do just that.<br />the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G54OU"">Buster Food Cube Large Size (Colors May Vary)</a> was one of the first products we bought. it does what it says. the only downside is loading it takes time and is kind of a pain.<br />we have since moved on to the<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M"">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG"">OurPets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball, 5 Inches</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ"">Premier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large</a>. all of which are easier to load and accomplish the same goal.  we use one of these daily to feed our buddy or fill it with treats to occupy him for a little while.  all three get pushed around until all the treats are gone - we have carpet so it's not as noisy as others have mentioned.<br />the kong wobbler is bigger than you would expect and it is a little heavy too - but out of the three our dog likes it the best.  the whole is big so, as other reviewers have mentioned, you may need to devise a way to make it smaller.<br />the iq treat ball is awesome.  easy to load and you can adjust the difficulty.  just rolls and rolls until the treats are gone.<br />the tug-a-jug is more challenging than the other two - but once your dog figures it out they get the treats no problem.  small treats do come out easily so we add larger chunks to add to the challenge.<br /><br />p.s. we also tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002I0RLW"">Premier Pet Busy Buddy Twist 'N Treat Dog Toy, Small</a> but it was a pain to load as well - twisting and un-twisting the hard plastic was not as easy as it should be.  and in less than a year the plastic stem tore and broke leaving it useless."
Power Bar Gel,"This is a great, convenient product to carry at all times, when you need a carbohydrate."
enhances the flavor of soups and salads,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FEH6O4"">Reese Homestyle Ranch Croutons, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />I am on a diet and probably will be on a diet forever.  It can get boring eating the same food every day.  I hate to cook so everything I eat is already prepared by a well known diet food company and all I do is microwave it. I enjoy eating a salad or a lite soup with my meal.  These croutons are fantastic.  They are low in calories and since there are not too many if any mouth watering lite soups or salads these croutons are an essential part of my diet.  I also bought then in the cheddar flavor and they are just as great as these.  I hope that Amazon keeps these around for a long time.  I noticed that many of my favorite food items which I have ordered from Amazon and that are included in their Subscribe and Save program are unavailable with a comment stating we do not know if these will be available again. This is especially annoying to someone like me who has to watch my caloric intake. When one is on a diet it takes a long time to find something palatable which makes eating a low calorie meal enjoyable and delicious. These croutons are a great addition to otherwise tasteless foods. I love em and recommend them to everyone even those who are lucky enough not to have to watch what they eat."
Yum!,"The greatest thing, honey you can sprinkle! Great on ice cream, buttered toast, anywhere you would use honey, with NONE of the mess!"
Nom Nom,I like to mix it with muscle milk for an after workout recovery snack. Even just using water it comes out great but I like to use almond breeze vanilla for a better taste.
Ehh,"This is good for gluten-free, but not as delicious as Pamela's other products.  I wish I hadn't bought this in bulk, as now I have four un-eaten packages taking up space!  Wouldn't buy in bulk moving forward."
Very good for those with Allergies,My daughter is allergic to nuts and soy and this mix is a great substitute for the real thing. I made a batch and froze it so whenever we go to a party I just grab one for her. she doesn't know the difference.
Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible,"Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.  It was horrid.  Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware."
Received One Packet for Review - Tastes Good!,"The only drawback to receiving only one packet is that it does not include the dietary information that I expected.  It tastes good and, at the same time, I would have liked information to determine if this would fit well with my health plan.  Without this information, I would be reluctant to order more."
"Best gluten-free pasta, bar none!","In the 6 years that I've been gluten-free, I have tried EVERY pasta on the market.  Notta Pasta is most like the ""real"" thing, by far.  I recommend cooking it a little longer than the recommended time, then rinsing with cold water.  Left overs keep well for 2 to 3 days in the fridge."
easy electric fence system,This produst was so easy to set up and use. The price was great too.
This stuff is no joke,"So I bought this along with the Dave's Ultimate Insanity, and this stuff takes the cake.  Delicious flavor, unbelieveable heat.  I put about 10 droplets in a bowl of salsa and should probably have used half that much.  I love hot sauce, more than 99% of people, and this sauce blew my top.  This is not going to sound like a good review, but believe me it is, its so hot it made me throw up.  USE WITH CAUTION because your body will try to reject it.  Most delicious poison ive ever tasted!  Enjoy!"
Good product,It is a bit sweet but it is an addictive snack. I Enjoy planters honey roasted peanuts. It is better than the original product.
Great snack,These are great snacks.  I cut them in half and my children share them.  Good protien and not a lot of fat.
Excellent for Asian dishes.,"I've already reviewed these on a smaller quantity page, but I don't want someone whining about the cost without actually tasting them to deter people from giving them a try. If you're expecting these to taste like something from Olive Garden right out of the package, you'll be pretty disappointed. They are nothing like the standard Italian-style pasta, but if you know how to cook - they are GREAT. I make mine in spicy Asian-inspired dishes. Follow the directions on the package and you'll have a nice addition to your meal. (I would never even attempt to eat these plain) They turn what would normally be a 500-600 calorie dish into less than 100 for a very similar flavor. They absorb the flavor of the sauce/soup you put them in. I make them for lunches a day or so ahead of time and store them with the noodles on the bottom so they soak up as much flavor as possible. The price is not bad, considering how many calories they save you on a daily basis."
Golden loves them!,"My Golden can get picky and eating is not a priority for him. I was worried during training he was going to be too anxious to not eat any training treats. Well...these he will eat and I am very great-full! However, they do not have the best smell (definitely not something I would eat). :) Will be purchasing more."
POP Chips on the go,If you haven't discovered Pop Chips yet - you don't know what you are missing.  Low calorie and high in flavor.  Great for the kids lunches. I need the single servings or I will eat the whole big bag.
Contains CHICKEN,"Although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken. I did not see this ingredient listed on the product page. This is just to advise those pet parents if your kiddo has a poultry or chicken allergy like mine do that every variety to date contains both chicken and natural chicken flavor.<br />The ingredients are as followed for the Joint Health variety<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic brown rice powder, rice powder, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch, chicken, natural chicken flavor, organic oat fiber, organic flaxseed, parsley, chia seed, glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, carrageenan (natural seaweed extract), fat product (natural source of DHA from algae), capsaicin, peppermint."
Guess what's in this bag?,"While I like the taste of the blend I received this time, I would be happier if Senseo offered a generic bean, such as Columbian Supremo instead of an unidentifiable blend. By offering a blend, Senseo can change the mix to reflect their current costs for the various Columbian beans. The next time I purchase this, if I do, it could have an entirely differant taste."
German Chocolate Cake in a cup,This coffee tastes just like German chocolate cake but not too sweet.  The rich blend of milk chocolate and vanilla with a little bit of coconut tastes great!  I would definitely buy this product again.  It is one of the best I've tasted from Coffee Masters.
Outstanding!,"My wife admits to being a chocoholic and one of my tasks is to keep her away from it rather than be an enabler. Well, it's now the holiday season and there's all these gifts and good food and what not. So, we were in our local ""Fresh and Easy"" grocery store with all their nice little displays of gourmet foods and there was a small shelf of chocolate bars. She picked up a couple, and what could I say? One was a 3.5 ounce bar of Green & Black's Organic Milk Chocolate. We sampled (read: ate) it this evening after the meal. My wife was in almost in shock. She proclaimed that this was one of the best milk chocolates that she's ever had. It was simply outstanding!<br /><br />Well, I'm not a chocolate aficionado and, in fact, try to stay away from it because I can't control my consumption very well. I'd agree that this bar was outstanding! It was cocoa rich with a slight bitterness and tasted more like what I would call a dark chocolate. It was much less sweet than the typical milk chocolate and quite delicious. Evidently, a lot of care is taken in the manufacture and all the ingredients are organic. Well, the care shows. I can't remember a better chocolate bar.<br /><br />Try it if you ever get the chance. Be ready to get out the stored Thighmaster and exercise bike.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"Good for ""instant""","I realize this isn't ""instant"" but the convenience of the machine makes it seem as if it were. I like espresso. I like it strong, bold and dark. This really wasn't as bold or strong as I expected it to be. I liked the flavor of it, but almost want to call it strong coffee...not espresso.<br /><br />However, I never make espresso at home. I don't have a fancy machine and don't know how to make it anyway. This Nescafe machine makes a pretty nice cup for a home machine. Simple enough that you can overlook some slight flavor preferences in exchange for such ease."
rip off,"they were great, like all mini reeses are, however, for the price (i paid $30) this bag is TINY!!! I found the same bag the next day for $15!  0--its about 12"" high--fills a 1 gallon candy jar half way (type in penny candy jar, or 1 gallon heritage jar)"
Way too sweet and directions don't make sense,I don't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.
My favorite,"This is a great espresso, and amazon has the BEST price out there!  I can't drink hot coffee in the summer, so I have started brewing this the night before.  I make about 4 double shots, but brew it more like an americano - into a small pyrex cup.  Then I allow it to cool, pour it into a container with a little ice, and the next morning, voila - Iced Americano as soon as I wake up without having to mess with the espresso machine.  I have tried other brands, Illy, Fresh and Easy, but this is my favorite and the price is right."
My Dog Wouldn't Touch this with a Ten Foot Pole!,"My dog seems to be allergic to poultry so we thought we would switch him to this lamb-based formula.  Usually he is a good eater, but my dog had one smell of this stuff and wouldn't come back.  I understand Wellness puts higher-end ingredients in their food but if a dog doesn't like it there goes your money right down the drain."
A great popcorn for small children!,"This popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn, and it is virtually hulless.  That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.  With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!"
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmm!,"I can't believe it is sugar free!  Excellent!  Creamy... unbelievably good!  They sent me the wrong flavor....mint, but I like it."
kind bars,Have bought these fruit and nut bars for years. always great and a high quality product. Great for hiking and going to the beach.
Mint Syrup Review,"I'm delighted that it's now possible to get Teisseire Mint Syrup here in the US.  Add a bit to ice cold water, and make your own ""menthe a l'eau"". Mix with sparkling ""limonade"" or ginger ale for a ""diabolo menthe"". You'll feel like you're back in Paris sitting at an outdoor cafe. It's delicious!"
"Tasty, but didn't delete my need for a Starbucks run.","These k-cups taste good and are great for a quick Chai fix. They're also a good coffee alternative, but they not good enough to replace my Starbucks stop for a Chai latte or an Apple Chai."
Not the right plants for the AeroGarden!,"Ok, I love the Aerogarden and it worked great with my last batch of herbs. But the tomatos grow very fast and even with tons of trimming, I can't seem to keep them away from the lights. But that is not the biggest problem. Since the roots are not attached to anything, the tomato plants fall over in all directions. You can TRY to follow the instructions to tie them up somehow but the reality with the garden is that it is not easy to do so. There is only the one hood support to use. So even using garden ties, velcro, etc, the plants are always flopping around. If Aerogrow is reading this - I have a suggestion for you: Use the four ""unused"" holes in the tray to hold some sort of support towers for plants that get that big or need to climb. There could be some sort of snap in cone or something to help hold plants up."
Stunningly good!,"I'm not here to bs anyone.  This Tropical Fruit Salad from Roland is absolutely the best i've had in a long time.  I'm still trying to figure out how it's not soggy at all.  It's canned, yet so fresh as if you just cut up the Fruit and served it.  Buy this and try it.  You won't be sorry."
Non-gmo magnesium boost,"So glad that there are companies that are making products without gmo.  This magnesium tastes great and when I drink it I can feel my system soaking up the nutrient, and feel the relaxing effects immediately.  Great stuff.  I have more relaxed energy and have slept much better since taking this product."
5 stars,"I just ordered 5 boxes of Solbites to give to my customers at Fiat of Montgomeryville. Within a week the supply was depleted. Great packaging, great taste, great addition to the cluttered assortment of snacks. Solbites gets five stars from Fiat of Montgomeryville. Look for our next order!"
Organic milk,yummy and convenient and without all the stuff you don't need. Great for on the go and good vanilla flavor- can't go wrong.
Terrific treats,"Izzy, our rescue Mini Schnauzer, has tummy issues. We've had to go to a sensitive stomach dog food, and be very careful with what we feed her for snacks and treats. We've been looking for treats she'll like, with ingredients she can have, and made in the United States. With Zuke's we get it all.<br /><br /> We also have to limit how much treat she can get in a day, but with the small size of these treats, about the size of pencil eraser tips, so we can give her 3 or 4 and use them as rewards when training.<br /><br />She loves the salmon flavor, and while I can smell they are salmon, they don't stink and my hands aren't gross after giving Izzy her treats. So far we have hadn't any bad reactions and she enjoys getting a yummy treat, she doesn't have to know it's good for her too!"
Great on yogurt.,This tastes really good on my yogurt.  It is so hard to find gluten free granola but I love the Kind brand.
Absolutely the yummiest of the Blue Diamond flavored almonds,"I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried. They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).<br /><br />I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.<br /><br />Mir"
Thankfully this formula is also for infants,"I exclusively breastfed my first child for 2.5 years. When I had twins 8 months ago, I found it impossible to exclusively breastfeed them. Thankfully, I found this wonderful organic formula which they were supplemented on from day 1 (and they were a month early).<br /><br />If you go to the website (www.natureone.com) you will see that the ingredients are identical to infant formulas - they simply call it a toddler formula for political reasons. See below.<br /><br />My twins are thriving and healthy. More pediatricians should read up about this and recommend it to those moms unable or unwilling to breastfeed. At least your babies won't be getting all the pesticides and growth hormones etc in commercial formula. It's really a sad state of affairs when there is only one organic formula available. Mothers need to demand better products, healthier products for their infants.<br /><br />Kim,<br /><br />Mother of three.<br /><br />extract from website: ""...Infant Formula Act (IFA), passed in 1980. Baby's Only Organic® meets the nutritional requirements of the IFA just like conventional infant formulas. Baby's Only Organic® is labeled as a toddler formula due to the company's philosophy to promote breast milk for infants the first year of life when possible (as mandated by the World Health Organization). If breast milk is not available, Baby's Only Organic® can be used for an infant less than 12-months of age as directed by a healthcare professional. Baby's Only Organic® has complete nutrition - nothing is missing, nor is it concentrated. For any age baby, mix the formula according to label instructions. """
My Opinion? Doesn't taste great,"I don't want to say that this is a bad product, because some people may enjoy this. Since it was fruit, I was expecting a taste more sweet than it is. That being said, all it contains is dried fruit, so there isn't any added sugar, just the natural fruit sugar. I prefer the raisins over the mixed fruit. The fruit selection was varied, and some fruits tasted better than others. They do have a long shelf life, so if you want fruit that lasts a long time (what I was looking for), this is the product to get."
Great Taste and Reasonably Priced,"I personally don't like strong coffee.  If you like weaker coffee, then this blend is a great choice for you.  Other reviews on here say that its too weak, which is probably true if your used to something strong.<br /><br />I also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste. For the price, it can't hurt to give it a try."
Great Duo,"Perfect. My two favorite flavors yoked together in one package. A good price, too.<br /><br />My order came within twenty-four hours with free shipping, but I think that's because I'm a prime member. Oh, well, whatever. Timothy makes a great cup of java and this was not a disappointment."
Pups are healthier- and not itching all the time!,"There is a noticeable difference in our dog's scratching once on this food (they were on Beneful before). They do not itch anymore and they used to it constantly. I have not noticed weight loss in either, but they are happy, healthy and love the food. I like the food because there is no seafood in it, which gives our dog's bad breath. There breath is fresh (or at least not smelly) with this food. We have a Golden Retriever and Puggle.<br /><br />*The first couple of times I ordered it Amazon offered free shipping and now I noticed they are charging for shipping. Hopefully this will change or else I will be looking to purchase from a different vendor."
"Best flavor, hands down of Popchips is barbeque!!","I bought a multi-box of flavors but this was the absolute best flavor (IMHO) in there so it's the one I'll comment on.  Spicy, sweet, flavorful, fun, crispy, lower fat than chips, I loved it.  I'll be buying more but only of this flavor.  The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked."
My Dogs are Wild About These Treats!,"I was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my Vet.  My 14 year old Springer who has never been much into doggie bones LOVES these things!!  They make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation.  My old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles.  I have a younger Springer who also loves the bones but she doesn't need much motivation to do anything, ha, but they are also great training aids.  I also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter I had at my home for his 3 dogs and he said they loved them too....so I guess that's antidotal but that's 5 dogs that really love the things!  Oh, the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your Vet, about twice as much per pound, so this is a great buy.  Buy a nice food safe container from Home Depot and fill it up.  You won't run out of bones for a while and that's a good thing!"
Filling and delicious,"These bars are great.<br />- filling<br />- crunchy (but not too crunchy - good combination of chewy and crunchy)<br />- Nice touch of dark chocolate<br />- Peanuts and almonds<br />- 10g of protein (mainly soy based, but some from whey as well)<br /><br />They also contain less of the more questionable ingredients. It doesn't have ""high fructose corn syrup"" for example.<br /><br />Word of warning to the super food conscious:<br />- these are not super healthy (better than regular candy bars though)<br />- While it lacks high fructose corn syrup, it has high maltose corn syrup<br />- Various soy derivatives (not organic) like soy lechitin and soy protein isolates<br />- The always vague and all inclusive: ""natural flavors""<br /><br />I am not a big fan of Nature Valley granola bars, but these protein bars are great."
The perfect summer sausage,"I finally found the summer sausage that my 7 year old son loves.  He's a very picky eater, but he loves the Old Wisconsin Summer Sausage.  Very good price for a package of 3 with 20-ounce each. And it's something good to store for our emergency food supply box."
Tastey!,"I really enjoyed these. They were hard to find but I got them at Trader Joe's. Like Doritos, you can't eat just one!"
Amazing cleansing product!`,"I bought this tea for myself after finding out I had candida.  I boiled 4 tea bags each night in a glass Pyrex measuring cup, drank the liquid, and within 2 weeks, all of my Candida side-effects were GONE!<br /><br />GREAT product!<br /><br />-Linda"
Excellent!,I love these bars.  They are lighter and crisper than the nature valley brand.  Being that they have protein as well they make it a better choice to stave off hunger.
Not All It Is Cracked Up to Be,"I am a huge Special K fan. Especially Red Berry, but at heart I am a chocoholic. I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it. It is your average Special K flakes but with the addition of ""Chocolate Pieces"". The problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate. I am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but I would rather have a Fat Free Chocolate Jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth. So back to red berry for me!"
My favourite K-Cup variety,"I have a pretty serious coffee habit.  I drink 3 or 4 cups in the morning and a couple more through the day.  I enjoy flavourful grinds, with nutty characteristics, but not too strong.  While I can and have drunk Italian style espresso, for my daily coffee I prefer something that doesn't have a chance of making me jumpy or give me a headache.  This Caribou Columbian is perfect."
Your dog will go through them fast.,"I like that I can stuff treats in the center of them, but my dog's an enthusiastic chewer and she's through with this in no time.  I order them occasionally for a little variety."
Way Too Expensive,"These sugar-free caramels are indeed delicious (and deserve 5 stars for taste), but a price hike at Amazon from $53.42 to $87.00 in a little over 2 months is more than I can stomach.  I'll buy them somewhere else."
Addictive!,"I purchased the variety pack based on other reviews and was quite pleased.  I am pretty choosy about snacks and food in general, and these crunchy, tasty, chips exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the cheese flavor.  I would order these again."
Wedding cookies better than honeymoon sex,"These cookies are the most addictive cookies on the market.  They aren't like your regular wedding shortcake cookies.  First, they add teeny little chocolate chips and an assortment of oils (that tastes like a hint of malt) to the recipe.  With a hint of coconut. Yes, the powdered sugar absorbs into the malted cookie, making them appear different than ones you would buy in your bakery. The cookies are sort of brown, the sugar absorbs into the cookies, I assume because they are still warm when they get coated.  Has nothing to do with the sugar turning brown because of age.  It also makes them taste better than anything out there.  Just make sure you have a gallon of cold milk handy, and plenty of coffee if you don't want to fall asleep from eating a whole bag.  There's no accounting for taste, but I think these things should come with a Surgeon's General warning.  I quit smoking years go, but still occasionally indulge in a bag or two of these to relieve stress.<br /><br />I grew up with these in the deep south, and once I went in the military and started moving around I found that they weren't available in all markets throughout the country.  I have ordered these online, a few dozen at a time for Christmas presents to fellow addicts.  It may be better to grab in your grocery store - especially around the holidays - but if you can't, buying here is a safe bet.  If you don't like coconut, chocolate, or malt, you probably won't care for these.  But I've given away more than a few bags or these and never seen them last more than a couple of days.<br /><br />Try them.  I think you'll really like them."
GREAT Cocoa for the price.,"Lets face it, $11 isn't going to get you the most succulent chocolate in the world.  But it does give you a GREAT everyday cocoa in a 6oz brew. Great to mix with a coffee for an instant mocha, and no sugar needed!  Kids will LOVE it. VERY happy with this purchase.  Will keep this in my pantry always!"
Perfect Condition,"I just received my package and was a little weary given some of the reviews I've read about the quality of the product and the packaging. However, it was in perfect condition!! The box said product of Thailand, none of the cans were dented and I can hear the milk slosh around when I shake the can. I would definitely order again based on what I received because I had none of the issues that other people reported."
Muesli as served on a cruise ship,I put 1/2 and 1/2 with some milk and sweetner on it and put it in a sealed container in the refrigerator.  Be sure to add enough liquid because the cereals soak up a lot of it.  I LOVE this!!!
Arrowhead Mills Puffed Wheat cereal is GREAT!,"I love this cereal! It's great, no sugar nothing bad for you just yummy taste. As soon as i began to run out of the puffed wheat i will order more. Thank you, Carol Johnson"
Adds Flavor and Heat.,"This is the first food product I ever purchased on Amazon.com.  The item came sealed and in perfect shape - I would have not accepted anything else.  I bought the 28oz bottle for $6.50.  I add this to soups and Chinese dishes which are just not spicy/hot enough.  This product is a little sweet, has a strong garlic flavor, has a vibrant and natural red color, but needs to be tasted to be judged - Taste is ultimately subjective.  Look at the ingredient list to get a better idea of what this product may taste like to you.  One of the real benefits:  You can add a little to a lot of food and still enjoy its taste.  One can use this as a dipping sauce, because its consistency is not watery - Before using, make sure to shake it a little.  I bought this around a week and a half before writing this review and the product's expiration date is in 2013."
This one is doing quite well now.,"I received my banana dwarf on Monday. Two of the four leaves were healthy. One of the others was broken. I hold out hope that it will flourish, but i give it 50/50 odds. I havent watered it since it arrived, and yet the soil is still quite saturated. This gives me cause for concern since the soil should only be moist for this plant, even though it is a tropical. I am leaving it outside for the next couple days to see if that will help, rather than by the window where it has been. I snapped a photo which i will have available here for review. I will continue to update this as things change for good or for bad. Presently, i can only offer three stars on the plant.<br /><br />July 6th: It has recovered and is doing quite a bit better. The broken leaf has actually grown back and looks strong. In addition, a new leaf is unfurling from the top of the plant. Definitely looks a lot better now. I have upped my rating to four stars to reflect the change in status.<br /><br />August 20th: The plant is doing quite well. Each new leaf that unfurls is larger than the last. What i have found is that the plant doesn't like direct sunlight, but does thrive in the heat. So, placing it in the shade seems to be the way to go...at least for my plant...at least until it gets cold, then it's coming inside for the winter.<br /><br />Update, January 6 (2012): This is by far the healthiest and most vibrant plant i own at this point. Each new leaf grows larger than the last. I have it indoors presently for the winter, sitting next to a window. It is still thriving. Some interesting notes....the leaves tend to grow against the window (because it is the light source most likely), and they trap condensation between them and the window, which seems to be beneficial. Also, we have had an issue with gnats, but for some reason, they tend to die around the banana plant, which is really good. We clean up the little bug graveyard every so often, and this benefits out other plants. I will take some more pictures soon, but from what i can tell, if your plant survives its transplant(s), you will have a wonderful addition to your home and/or garden. Presently, the plant is about three and a half feet tall, btw."
Awesome,"The warheads were what i expected, except for the sour stuff coating it was a little melted but was prabobly from shipping. They tasted the same anyways. it came really fast and like it said there was 230 of them! this is going to last me a month!"
YUM! &lt;3,Got these in the mail today which was sooner than it said it would be delivered. At first they were strange being my first time having them. But none the less they were sooo good! You do have to kind of have an quired taste for them though. The texture and taste may seem a little strange at first. I have one left now. I recomend to at least try these if you haven't had them because they really are good! :)
lol energy,"i drank one of these at 8:40 am and didnt get to sleep until 4 am!! maybe there were other factors involved but, if i drink a cup of coffee at around 5 or 6 pm i dont get to sleep until late as well. anyway my local dollar store sells these for 1.50 so check around. still a bit expensive but ill drink em. berry tastes decent. lemon lime is atrocious."
Delicious Tea! I am sold!,I love this tea... It is fabulously delicious and caffeine free on top of it all. This tea is perfect for drinking anytime day or night.
Yummy chip alternative,My family enjoys this snack very much.  It is a lighter alternative to chips.  The Vinegar is light and does not overpower the flavor of the fries.
Taste + health in one box,"Fibre...check<br />Protein...check<br />Vitamins...check<br /><br />What? You want your cereal to taste great as well? Well here's your answer.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Healthy (still has sugars though)<br />+ Delicious<br />+ Crunchy, doesn't get soggy even after prolonged submersion<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The size of the granola clusters isn't all uniform. The clumps at the top of the box are quite large, and towards the end you're left with powdery stuff. Not a big minus, but I like my granola to be uniformish."
Love it,"Stash Moroccan mint is my favorite, but this makes a nice change.  IT's got the same mellow mint as the Moroccan mint, but it's also got lime flavor.  It's not like drinking a mojito- but with a fresh slice of lime and some sugar, it's pretty darned good.  I drink it how, but the other reviewer suggested it over ice.  That would be great, I'm sure- I just happen to like my tea hot."
Not the worst thing I've ever tasted,"I try to avoid artificial sweeteners, but I love Mountain Dew and Diet Mountain Dew. I've enjoyed Zevia Root Beer and Cola in the past (though only when poured into a glass - it is nasty straight from the can.)<br /><br />When I saw Mountain Zevia at the Sunflower Market I thought I would give it a try. Uhm, you know how Mountain Dew looks like anti-freeze? This looks more like pee. I can get past that, but it tastes like Airborne - you know the Vitamin/Cold treatment? I would say half orange/half lemon lime Airborne. Not the worst taste, but I don't take Airborne for the flavor, and when I take it I usually mix it with a small amount of water and drink it like a shot.<br /><br />I don't regret trying it, but I won't buy it again. Mountain Dew is incredibly artificial tasting, and I imagine that is hard to duplicate with only natural flavors. Thanks for trying Zevia!<br /><br />I don't recommend this flavor - but I do recommend the Cola and Ginger Root Beer. Those are yum"
A Little Sweet but Still Delicious!,"Crystal Light's Peach Iced Tea is a little sweeter than other flavors like the Raspberry Lemonade. It has a very mild tea flavor that is pleasant and not overpowering. Since we already lug tons of bottled water from Costco it is great not to have to also buy bottled drinks. The Crystal Light packets make drinking more water a breeze. Since I started using these packets I keep water in the refrigerator and mix up some tea for when I'm reading or out shopping. I also love to make slushies with this drink mix. Just put a bottle in the freezer for a few hours and then shake vigorously. I will say these ""on the go"" flavors can be a bit addictive. With so much variety in flavors these drinks really make life a little more fun.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
"mildly carrotcakey, but ok. Frosting, not ok","The taste is not that of normal Carrot cake, but it is not unpleasant. The cake by itself is average, and makes a reasonable if expensive treat for a low carb diet.<br /><br />The frosting on the other hand, is not that of carrot cake frosting, and it IS unpleasant. It requires cream cheese to make, and to be honest, you would be better off just spreading the raw cream cheese on the cake. We did not, but if I ever buy it again, I will try that."
Good Service,We have ordered this coffee several times and it always arrives on time and has never been out of date.  It's my wife's favorite.
McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal,"If it were not for the LOUSY packaging, I would rate McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal 5 stars.  The oatmeal is delicious with a nutty flavor and I will never be able to eat regular oatmeal again after having tasted it.  Plus, it is so good for you.  My family loves the oatmeal.<br /><br />Having said that, however, the people or department responsible for preparing the oatmeal for mailing should be terminated. I have ordered three separate times and each time the oatmeal containers arrive damaged.  I even complained to Customer Service and all they did was send me more oatmeal free to replace what I had received.  The free shipment was also damaged. This oatmeal comes in these really beautiful tins that would be reusable in so many different ways, i.e., filling the tin with steel cut oatmeal cookies as a gift, but the cans are so dented up that you can't use them.  Fortunately, this does not affect the quality of the oatmeal, but I feel like I am being ripped off because none of the beautiful cans are salvageable.  Apparently this is not important to Customer Service (I have seen several complaints from other reviewers about the same thing) or they would do something about it.  I am going to try and find another source for this delicious oatmeal."
smells great and smooth,I love the smell of this conditioner and it's smooth and effective.  Just a very small volume of the conditioner makes my hair looks shiny and smooth.  High recommend this product.
These taste like lemon juice,This is good - It tastes like real lemon juice. I go through these pretty quickly by putting lemon juice in every glass of water that I drink.
best caviar for the dollar. Great compared to grocery store brands.,"This brand is not to salty, not to fishy. Great caviar taste with ample pop. The freshness is evident. I have bought this brand over and over and it's never let me down. I've introduced several friends and family members to caviar using this brand and it never fails to impress. Highly reccomended."
product of China,It is a product of China. If I had known I would not have ordered it. For those of you that share my concerns you will find the information useful. As for the rest of you - ignore this review - or - do some research on the safety of what is comeing out of China.
Long Lost Throat Drops,I have hunted for Luden's Original Menthol Throat Drops for a number of years.<br />They have not been available in any grocery or drug store in my area. I was<br />delighted to find them on Amazon (don't know why I didn't try there before).
Might be the best chips I've ever had,"These are REALLY terrific, crunchy and flavorful with no artificial taste.  Not only might the be the best chips I've ever eaten, I'm wondering if they're the best FOOD I've ever eaten.  If Amazon would start carrying my beloved Apple Beer I could quit going to the grocery store entirely."
Very poor tea,I bought 3 bags of this tea and found each to be just as bad as the last.  This tea has a very weak/poor flavour.  I tried to brew it very stong but it still ends up tasting bad.
Good Things Come in Stinky Packages,"I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells."
Meh.,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."
Eagle Pack Holistic,"I can't say enough nice things about Eagle Pack brand dog foods, especially their holistic line.  Cured my dogs of ear problems, hot spots and other intestinal problems quickly and my dogs love the taste.  It does cost a bit more, but well worth it when you factor in expensive vet visits and loss of sleep while the poor dog scratches and scratches while you watch helplessly.  Do yourself and your dog a favor and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."
Tastes Very Pure,"I have to give them credit for how smooth the taste of this is. They did a good job purifying it ahead of time. It didn't have any lingering chlorine taste or anything like it that I detected.<br /><br />It is obviously more impractical and expensive to buy bottles of this and have them shipped to you than it is to purchase a filter that can handle a much larger quantity. For the occasions when you feel like you really need to have some on hand that has already been purified (and particularly if you've interested in the fact that it has a 9.5pH), though, this works out just fine."
small,"Bought the largest size and hoping it was the size it said on the description it was not , half the thickness easy if not smaller , not what I paid for"
pork rinds,My husband & I discovered this item while shopping a while back and fell in love with them.  they are so fresh when you take them out of the microwave.  We like the spices on them.  You just have to remember to take them out of the microwave as soon as the bag rises.
I was able to eat bread again!,Since being gluten free I've tried all types of GF breads and they are all very expensive. Who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread! It's custom which is probably why they are all so skinny! lol But I loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more!
Much Healthier Cats Since Switching,"I have two cats with chronic problems. Marci had chronic diarrhea. I took her to the Texas A&M pet clinic. Several tests were run to identify the cause. None of the tests results identified any problems. After I switched to Purina One, her diarrhea cleared with no recurring problems.<br /><br />My other cat, Beauty-Bells, suffered from recurring urinary tract infections. She has not one since eating Purina One. I have not had to buy the formula for urinary tract infections. The regular Purina One formulas have been sufficient.<br /><br />Being on a tight budget with 8 cats, I had long hesitated to switch to food that is so much more expensive. My cats actually eat less. They are also much healthier with shiny, soft coats and more energy. I switched 3 kittens to Purina one and the differences in health were obvious much quicker than with the older cats. I keep threatening to put them on cheaper food because they are tearing up my house with all the energy they have! Of course, I them to much to do that!<br /><br />The switch has been well worth it. Being so happy and amazed with results, I don't think I'll ever feed them anything else."
Great Pepper at a Reasonable Price,"After trying to find whole peppercorns in bulk in grocery markets at anything but outrageous prices, Amazon came through with a reasonable price.  Peppercorns are no longer inexpensive, but at least with Amazon, one doesn't have to feel ripped off.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPHIO0"">India Tree Tellicherry Pepper, 2.3 lb</a>"
awesome,"i love this cappuccino, its like the stuff that you get from the gas station and i love that stuff. if you like gas station cappuccino then you will like this, i make it on the 10oz cup size and its perfect. i got the subscription its cheap and really good."
Son loves these!,My son is 15months and this is still one of his favorite gluten free snacks. I just wish they would make all their puffs gluten free. He dosen't seem to mind though.
I ordered 100% columbian coffee and was sent 100% arabica.,"I ordered 100% Columbian coffee and 100% arabica coffee arrived. according to the policy I have no recourse but to absorb the cost myself and to trash this Arabica CRAP coffee. There is not a refund for this Arabica coffee, for years we could get 100% Columbian coffee, it is a large bean grown in the Columbian highlands. The aroma is easy on the nostrils, and while brewing the aroma permeates the entire house. Now try that with Arabica, the taste is bitter and unappealing to the senses."
Great taste but it sure crumbles!,We love the taste but hardly any cookies are whole.  I would have given them 5 stars otherwise.
Great flavored coffee,Wolfgang Puck coffees are great and the Creme Caramel is one of my favorites. I would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor.
"Great Stuff, great quality...","Excellent quality, no need to sift for stones, etc. (like the one from the Russian store :) plus it's Organic!"
Inconvenient,"I've always used the regular ""litter tray with the scooper"" procedure but when I saw this type, it seemed too good to be true. It was. When you pour the litter on top of the strainer tray, some of the clean litter sifts through and the cats end up with half of the clean litter originally put in. The clumping litter makes solids adhere to the underside of the strainer tray. You have to bang it against something to get the dirty litter off. As you do this, litter sprays around the floor -- no matter how hard you try to be neat, adding an additional ""sweeping step"" to the whole procedure. Also, the litter you have ""strained"" weighs in pretty hefty when you're crouched on the floor lifting and sifting the entire tray of litter daily! So, I say, if you just scoop it daily with a regular scoop, you will get the job done in half the time, with half the mess and half the trouble. I'm going back to the old method."
H 2 Oh!,"I don't think there's a lot you can say about this product.  It's bottled water.  It's not even sparkling or flavored with anything.  But as far as bottled water goes, this is good.  It's a lot better than the cheap store brands, which usually taste like tap water.  It's better than some of the cheaper retail brands like Dasani too.  Whether it stacks up against the really high end brands I have no idea since I don't drink those.  Anyway, since it is pretty much just regular water I wouldn't see any point paying any excessive price for it, but it is good.<br /><br />That is all."
I love Almonds and chocolate,"So this was a great purchase. I like the fact that instead of one solid bar it now comes in two pieces [inside the same wrapper] which makes it easier to share if you wish to do so.<br />The candy wrapper has also changed. The new wrapper will keep moisture from getting in and help the candy to stay fresher longer. You can tell when chocolate isn't fresh because it will have a white film on it. This means that certain ingredients in the chocolate have separated thus giving it that unappetizing appearance, and the candy will taste chalky. Yuck.<br />Now if you're thinking about eating this instead of the regular Snickers with peanuts because you are allergic to peanuts....DON'T....since both are made in the same factory there is a good chance that it might have come in contact with peanuts.<br />The candy is also a great price when compared to what they sell for here in Michigan; plus you can't beat the free shipping."
Shipping problems,"Our family loves these pop tarts and we were glad to find them as the grocery stores will no longer carry them.  That said, at least three of the pop tart boxes were crushed upon delivery.  Makes them hard to toast and eat.  I am not sure who I can tell to make sure they are handled better next time."
good coffee,"My favorite coffee it is bold but not over powering. i like this coffee and it is a joy to drink,one of the best k cup bolds out there. amazon good price and coffee people good product"
Nasty stuff,"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money."
Yummy!,"If you like Shortbread you will really like these. Walkers always makes the best Shortbread.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLXG"">Walkers Shortbread Highlander Shortbread Portion Pack, 1.4 Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a>"
GF Bisquick never disappoints,"I made delicious banana pancakes last week using this product and over the weekend, remade a family favorite from years ago, Chicken and Dumplings, which was on the Betty Crocker Website under GF.  We couldn't tell the difference between the GF and regular mix in the dumpling results.  I made the recipe from scratch for six, using chicken breasts and thighs simmered till tender in chicken broth, baby carrots, celery, cut green beans, onion and seasonings and stirred up some white gravy to pour over the dish before serving.  Husbie loved it."
The customer is always right.,"We (I work at a small grocery store) ordered this item at the suggestion of a customer.  When I got around to trying one, WOW!  The drink is sweet, but not overly so, and quite ginger-y.  I love the taste of ginger.  As far as the kick goes, I think it's perfect.  Enough to get you going, but not so much that you won't be able to sleep.<br /><br />I have Raynaud's Syndrome.  Basically, my hands are always cold.  When they become very cold, they hurt pretty badly and turn blue.  Temperature and stress are the main bullies to trigger these attacks.  Caffeine is not good for me either, as it constricts your blood vessels.  For some reason, I can drink this stuff without any bad side effects.  This fact and the taste are why I continue to drink Reed's Energy Elixir."
Please Assort your Way into my Mouth,Airheads are an iconic candy and remind me of my youth.  The flavors are delicious and satisfying.<br /><br />In our box we received:<br />-Watermelon<br />-White Mystery<br />-Orange<br />-Cherry<br />-Blue Raspberry<br />-Pink Lemonade<br /><br />Would I love a tad more variety?  Sure.  BUt overall you will not be disappointed.  Unless you do not like Airheads.  Then you will be very disappointed.
But the aftertaste..,"I'll begin this by saying I only really bought it because it was gluten free. It was a bonus that it was also lactose free. At first taste it was good, but it had this awful after taste that was chalky and reminded me of eating potting soil. Maybe it needed something else to mask the after taste, but I'm not sure what.."
Tastes *nothing* like Sencha!,"For anyone who is a seasoned Sencha tea drinker, this is tea is a total dud.  It barely tastes anything like fresh, high quality Sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves.  I had to throw this in the trash because it's simply dreadful."
Please avoid!!,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo."
"Maybe not that filling, but healthy - variety pack","If your child is picky take note:  the apple and pear look the same but the strawberry & banana are in tiny pieces and are red colored.  For some reason, my 2 1/2 year old did not eat those.  I'm not giving up, don't get me wrong, I think he will eventually eat them, but I'm just letting everyone know.  I think these are a GREAT travel snack especially if you don't want to be cutting fruit.  They kind of melt in your  mouth which is cool.  I would not say these will fill you up, even for a busy boy toddler, so you may want to add a protein or fat with this as a snack.  That said, it will curb any minor munchies in a healthy way and on the go."
Strong and creamy,"I had been using Illy's Dark Roast for my daily latte, but I was getting sick of the incredibly high price for one 8.8 ounce can. This Lavazza has the same strength, but with a hint of chocolate (best way to describe it, honestly) and I find it has a much smoother feel to it. Plus, I can get four 8.8 ounce bricks for the price of 2 Illy 8.8 ounce cans... Glad I switched!"
Great for toddlers!,My 20 month old son can't get enough of these. We keep a box in the car for emergencies.
everything it promised,The vinturi is the third we have purchased (for ourselves and for gifts). It does exactly as advertised making wine right out of the bottle taste like it's been opening for an hour or more. We love it and so do the people we gave them to for gifts.
"Love, love this with the Ayurvedic White Chai - delicioso","Teavana had the Ayurvedic White Chai combined with this as a store sample. Loved. Ordered. Tastes just the same at home. Delish.<br /><br />Note - we ordered a tea kettle (on Amazon :)) that allows you to brew to specific temps. I recently learned the temp coupled with the steeping time makes all the difference.<br /><br />One more thing -- Teavana has an app. It provides directions for preparing all the teas they sell, including combinations between varieties. AND it has a little timer for steeping.<br /><br />Good job Teavana."
Great taste,"This product is great.  My husband and I both love it.  It is good as a supplement, and for cooking.  It has a wonderful scent and a soft taste.  It is a very healthy product.  We are pleased."
Bam!,"Warheads and Toxic waste candies are super sour! These candies are great, tastes good, gives you a good kick, and creates competition among friends and family.<br /><br />But caution:<br />It's citric acid. Any type of acid burns, the sour you taste is not really a taste... as crazy as it seems, it's really a feeling in your tongue. Yes it's a good amount of citric acid in one piece, but you're not supposed to eat multiple pieces in a short period of time. You will actually burn a layer of skin-like-material on your tongue. Too much consumption can cause the tongue to bleed. It will heal quickly, as long as you don't eat more in the process of healing.It is true your tongue will actually shed flakes like sun burn. I know it's disgusting but it's how the body heals naturally. Hope this information helped you, or any else it may concern. (Mostly your tongues)"
G R E A T......S O U P......M I X ....!,"All of Manischewitz's ""tube"" soup mixes, (so called because they coem in celephane tubes), are a good value for the money.  They taste great, and are truly THE most condensed of soups -- ONLY the dry ingredients are given, you add your own liquid, and thus save money, (not paying for water, as in other ""condensed"" soups), saving room in your pantry, and NOT having to put unopened packages in the refrigerator or freezer, thus saving valuable space there.<br /><br />I chose the Manischewitz Vegetable Cello Soup with Mushrooms, 6 ounce tubs, (Pack of 24), because I happen to LIKE mushrooms -- a lot.  But the interesting thing with all the tube soups offered by Manischewitz, is that they DO NOT contain an undue amount of salt!  One would think that an uncanned soup WOULD contain a LOT of salt, but this is not the case here.  Manischewitz obviously puts great faith in the protective power of cellophane, plastic wrappers -- and, thus, so should the customer!<br /><br />This is very tasty soup, which can be used as a complete soup, or as a soup base.<br />It is very inexpensive, because, as mentioned, you are NOT paying for water.<br />Make this -- and all other Manischewitz ""tube"" soups -- according to the directions, add your own ingredients if desired, and enjoy!  The money, pantry space, and refrigerator space,you will be saving, will make this delicious soup taste even better!  Enjoy - and I hope to see this, and other Manischewitz ""tube"" soups return to Amazon, very, very soon!"
"Zevia, Natural Cola with ERYTHRITOL","I recently purchased a case of Zevia.  I was anxious to try out this product.  It arrived today, much to my delight.  After drinking just a half of a can, I came down with a terrible headache.  I couldn't believe it.  The culprit...ERYTHRITOL, a sugar alcohol, the second ingredient in the product; not STEVIA, the fifth ingredient. Also, the product is purported to have -0- calories.  Erythritol contains 2.6 calories per gram.  There are 12 grams of erythritol in each can.  Most erythritol is made from fermenting GMO corn.  How healthy is that? This beverage is VERY expensive and would be well worth it if it were truly an all natural<br />drink, sweetened only with stevia, which is what I thought I purchased."
Newman's Own Decaf,"Great coffee, nice to find it here at semi-reasonable prices.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M2BM3O"">Newman's Own Organic Special Blend Decaf K-cup for Keurig Brewers, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
"Soft, Chewable, Yummy Treats for Your Aging/Arthritic Dog","I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better."
Amazing,"Plant was in amazing shape, packaging was excellent and the shipping was super speedy. I cannot believe how healthy this plant is and I really want to order a second one, but there aren't any left! I'll keep checking back though!"
Great decaf chai!,This tea has the classic chai flavor that I was looking for. I make it with milk instead of water. The fact it is decaf is a plus. I will buy this again.
Gross taste,"I'm sorry, but this coffee is not very good. It has a strange odor to it. Almost urine like. It tastes nothing like a Mocha that you purchase at Starbucks."
Tandoori better than dry rub,Very good but it was not the same as I had oversea.....but it was still better in taste to a dry rub I had in the past
Delightful,"Very unique and flavorful. The actual teabag, which holds the tea, could be of better quality. However, the tea is so good it still deserves 5 stars. I personally enjoy it will milk and sugar. This tea will brighten up your morning and mellow you out in the evenings. Get it while it's on sale and still in stock :)Have a nice day"
DANGEROUS BONES!!!!,DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.
My puppy loves these,"This is a great product-my dog loves these. I was a little disappointed that it is a ""product of China"" which I why I only gave it 3 stars."
The cats can't get enough!,"My cats are usually picky about food, but this is one product they can't get enough of! I think it's a great price for all the food you get, so you SAVE money. Great quality!"
"Tasty snack, very yummie and healthy for you",Only wish there were more almonds in it but it's an awesome all natural product. If you love granola then you'll love this product.
Fabulous  Gift!,"I sent this as a Birthday gift for my sister in law in NY...She was thrilled!! It arrived on time and in excellent condition, I would recommend this to anyone as a Birthday gift, especially for anyone growing up in the 70's :)"
10 month old LOVES these!,I bought this package for our 10 month old to practice self feeding and to have an easy snack on hand when traveling.  They are a step up from plain ol' cheerios!  She loves them and they melt quickly in her mouth.  The price was great with Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save.
"Love Plum Organics, Disappointed with 'beef stew'","My son (10 mo) loves everything Plum Organics we've ever given, but the Beef Stew is a total flop.  It is VERY runny, so tough to feed with a tiny little spoon and I mixed with baby cereal to give it enough texture to feed.  Then he was 'over it' about a third of the way through and stopped eating.  I tried it again a week later and he wouldn't eat it at all.  I wish I hadn't bought a big box of this - every other item has been great so I didn't think to try one before committing!"
Another good product from illi,"Illy issimo coffee drink - Cappucino is a decent ""coffee like"" drink in a can.  I would describe it as a mild cappucino flavor that isn't to sweet but fairly smooth. I received one can and drank it out of the refrigerator on a hot day, so mine was ice cold.<br /><br />The drink gave me a modest energy boost similar to a regular cup of coffee.  I normally wouldn't buy this type of product but I think its the best ""coffee replacement in a can"" type drink you can get although things freshly brewed area always better in my opinion."
A good candy fix,I accidently found this candy at Wal Mart while looking for something else. I also bought the lemon flavor. They are just what you want when<br />you need a sugar fix.  Not too sweet to get you in trouble and no aftertaste.
Good attempt for udon but there's definitely room for improvement!,The noodles are cracked and brittle when you mix in the hot water. Taste was fine but I couldn't get over the inconsistent texture of the noodles.
Air Dried Venison Formula-Dogs Like It,"I have been a raw feeder now for about a month. I've tried various high quality frozen and Freeze/Air-Dried dog food. I love ZiwiPeak's philosophy re quality and the ingredients seems to be top of the line. This is a nice idea for traveling with dogs who normally eat frozen raw (hard to go camping or car-tripping with frozen raw dog food). My Chow Chow first sniffed the food, walked away, then came back and ate it. My shih tzu walked away and left it (though she doesn't like dark meat generally - normally she eats fowl or rabbit - sometimes lamb). I am currently dog sitting for a poodle who will eat anything and he gobbled it right up. I may not purchase this product again simply because my dogs are really picky. But, I would purchase it if I had a dog like the poodle I am sitting for; as mentioned above, I feel this brand's ingredients are top of the line."
Good Stuff! Not Overly Sweet!!,"OK,..I'm speaking on behalf of the Orange Soda here. When I first popped the tab and drank a sip of the Zevia Orange,..it did NOT hit me with the anticipated sweetness that I had come to expect from say a Diet Sunkist Soda or any of your typical SugarFree Orange sodas. I wasn't disappointed per say, but just surprised a bit by the unexpected lack of sweetness.<br /><br />Now, with that being said,...and a few cans later,..this has quickly become my ""go to"" drink when I want a refreshing orange soda. It is very good and very quenching (due to the noticeable lack of sodium) on a hot summer day. The aroma is wonderful and the flavor is very close to as real as you can get before drinking straight orange oil. It's a really good soda and I'm now tempted to try the Root Beer and the Cola."
Strange love/hate relationship with this popcorn,"I think hate is too strong a word.  I do have a strange like/dislike relationship with this popcorn.  My first impression was ""OMG, it's popping all over my kitchen"".  My second impression was, ""Look how cute it is"", followed by ""this tastes REALLY good"".  And finally, ""I need a spoon to eat this stuff"".<br /><br />Love:<br />1. It truly is a very ""clean"" popcorn.  The lack of hulls makes it 100% worthwhile<br />2. Taste:  It's delicious.<br /><br />Not so much love:<br />1. I suppose because the small seeds are so light, it is truly (as one review said) a volcanic erruption.  I had to hold a towel over the opening to my air popper to assure the seeds stayed inside and didn't fly all over the kitchen.  If you want to entertain small children, pets or even yourself, put in the recommended 1/2 cup and stand back and watch the show.  You can totally get around this by adding a generous 3/4 cups of seeds instead of the ""do not exceed"" 1/2 cup.  It has caused no problems with our popper.<br />2.  Because the kernels are so small it's easy to drop them before you get them to your mouth.  This doesn't bother me that much, but it was a deal breaker for my mother when she came for a visit.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this popcorn for it's taste.  My 5-year old loves the small size so I'll break out my spoon and deal with the tiny kernels."
Something unique in this tea.,I love to drink this tea during the cold weather. Sometimes I would have it in the morning and before bedtime. There's something in this tea that does wonder for my skin. I noticed a big improvement in my skin when I drink this tea. I love the taste and smell of the spices too. I could never find another apple cinnamon spice tea like this one. Adding some honey will enchance the flavor if it's too blant for you.
Great Value!,"Love getting my pet food this way! Our 8 dogs love Pedigree and I love getting it delivered to my door. Per can, it costs a bit more, but when I consider cost of gas, as well as load it into my cart, unload at checkout, load back into the cart, load into car, unload at home...makes me tired just to write about it...home delivery is a fantastic bargain!"
Hemp products are great,"Hemp protein powder is great and this one appears have the best price. One suggestion I would make for the consumers of the great product is to learn how to make hemp milk from hemp seeds which are also available. I make my own hemp milk and mix it with the powder. Add some frozen strawberry, banana, or mango or whatever floats your boat and you are off to great start. This is my breakfast and I think its great. Have a wonderful healthy life everyone."
My Shih Tzu loves it!,My Shih Tzu is very finicky b/c he is so spoiled. I have to search high and low for treats he will accept. This is one of those few. Thank you!
My Cats Love These - The Large Size Is A Plus,"When I introduced these treats to my cats, I had to hold them out for them. At first, they thought they were toys. After they licked it, though, they realized they were yummy treats. It took a couple of days for them to learn the best way to eat them, but now they're pros. I just plop them on the floor and they chow down immediately. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot of crumbs, which a lot of people will probably hate, but, lucky for me, my cats are very clean and thorough so it hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Now, I know that other people are saying that the large size is a negative feature of these treats, but, really, it's not. If they were smaller, they may just be swallowed whole instead. That's what one my cats does with her food and other treats. Because of the size of these treats, though, she's forced to chew them, which is good since these are dental treats. They have to be chewed to be effective.<br /><br />The flavor of these treats must be really good too. My cats are usually very open to sharing food and treats with one another, but when it comes to these treats, they growl if the other tries to even sneak a crumb.<br /><br />Before I bought these, I thought about buying the ones by Petrodex. After I compared the ingredients, though, I realized these were the way to go. Petrodex has two additional ingredients. The first one I googled turns out to be poisonous to cats. It may not be harmful in small quantities, but I'd rather be safe than sorry."
Mild Flavor and Smooth,"This was bought for my wife who loves coffee. She says the taste is good. It had a good mild flavor, not bitter but smooth. She says it is a good pick me up in the morning."
Where's the TEA?,"NO TEA!  They took the tea OUT of the bags!  This was my absolute favorite tea: I drank it every day and kept it on auto-order.  Then suddenly one month I couldn't believe it: instead of lovely tea bags that justified their high price, they sent these pitiful bags with only a little hint of tea -- not enough to make even a single decent cup.  You can tell the old bags from the new by the wrappers: the good old ones were printed to match the box design, the bad new ones are just anonymous solid green.  I would never order it again.  They should charge a reduced price that's proportionate to the radical reduction in tea.  A complete rip-off.  Do not waste your money."
AMAZING STUFF!!!,"I love this stuff.  It tastes just like diet Dr. Pepper.  Aweosme.  You won't like it if you don't like Dr. Pepper, but that's cuz u don't like Dr. Pepper.  ACTUALLY HAS 23 flavors, pretty awesome.  I got the package from the sodastream starter kit and liked it so much that i sprinted to bed bath to get some more.  SO GOOOD!!!!"
Cream Cheese Frosting OK but White Chocolate Truffle THE BEST!!,"I have had this cake with both the cream cheese and white frosting.  For a real treat try frosting with a white chocolate frosting then call your heart surgeon (but what a way to go!):<br /><br />White Chocolate Frosting<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />6ounces White Chocolate -- chopped<br /><br />1/4 cup Whipping Cream<br /><br />1 cup Butter -- Cut In Pieces<br /><br />1 cup Powdered Sugar<br /><br />Don't forget to add a dash of salt!<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />Microwave white chocolate and cream in medium bowl on high for 1 1/2 minutes until chocolate is almost melted, stirring halfway through heating time. Stir until white chocolate is completely melted. Cool to room temperature. Beat butter and sugar gradually into cooled mixture on high speed until light and fluffy."
"Great product, great price!",This buckwheat flour is a great value and the quality is excellent.  I received promt answers to my questions from the company and found the customer service to be excellent.  I'll definitly be purchasing this flour again.
great taste,i love ordering on line esp from amazon>> just as i am about to run out of coffee i get a email re special deals<br />and i simply order and in a day the products are shipped<br />this coffee is fantastic<br />try it<br />also donut shop is great
Close enough to Mountain Dew,"My husband and I got a SodaStream system for Christmas and we love it!  We did the calculations for the cost of the CO2 and the syrups and it doesn't save us much money (if any) on canned drinks, but it saves us a TON of space and drastically reduces our waste.<br /><br />Anyway, my husband is an avid Mountain Dew (MD) drinker and he really likes the Fountain Mist (FM).  He says it doesn't taste exactly like Mountain Dew, but it's close enough.  So instead of drinking a few cans while he's playing games, he just whips up a liter of this and he's set, and our tiny apartment doesn't fill up with empty cans.  We also like FM because it's reduced calorie.  It's sweetened with sugar and Splenda, so an 8oz serving of FM is only 35 calories, while 8oz of MD is 110 calories.  So a whole liter of FM has about 150 calories, whereas a liter of MD has about 460 calories.<br /><br />I agree with reviewers here and elsewhere that say the SodaStream syrups can taste a little too much like artificial sweetener, especially the diet drinks, but I've found that it's just because SodaStream recommends using more syrup than you need.  I usually use about half the amount recommended and it's a lot better."
Great Potential for Bonsai,"Hirt's Gardens has been a great seller to deal with. The Bahama Berry starter plant is only one of several plants I bought from them and they all came well packed and in very short time. I was unfamiliar with this species but it is stunning as a small leafed variety that takes well to trimming. The leaves are so glossy that I had to grow it out for a while to believe that they weren't sprayed with high gloss shellac. It will mature for a few seasons for the tree to be eligible for a bonsai pot, but it will be worth the wait."
Vanilla Nut Cafe - favorite flavor,"The Maxwell House International Coffee - Vanilla Nut Cafe - is absolutely my favorite flavor!  Seems to be extremely difficult to locate now, though.  Last purchase was made through Amazon and hoping it will become available again soon!"
Great product,"I did some research before getting a kitten.  This was the best rated kitten food.  My little guy loves it.  It is, however, on the dry side so I find that adding a bit of water helps.  Since he gets just 1/2 a can 2x a day, I microwave the 2nd half of the portion in his dish for 10 seconds, along with a bit of water."
Very Poor Quality,The product arrived without any indication of expiration date. The chocolate was not fresh - not in its looks or taste
Best Espresso EVER!,"I have tried other brands and also other Lavazza coffees and this is the BEST BY FAR! The Crema from these beans is amazing! My machine makes both espresso and coffee and the crema is the same on both. I have to agree with the other review that said this is the same espresso that you get in Italy, after visiting Rome last fall I was craving an espresso like I had there and this coffee DID NOT disappoint!"
Very good.,"These sunflower seeds are very crunchy and have just the right amount of salt. I love to sprinkle them on salads. Mmmmm yummy. My order arrived with six months to go before the expiration date and I found that even after they had ""expired"" by about a month or two they were still very good. I like buying the seeds in the 8.5 ounce packages because they stay fresh longer than when I open one large bag.<br /><br />Update 7/11<br /><br />Nutritional Facts from actual package (Amazon's facts are all wrong according to the manufacturer's label):<br /><br />Serving Size 1/4 cup (30g)<br /><br />Calories per serving 190<br /><br />Calories from fat 140<br /><br />Total fat 15g<br /><br />Saturated fat 2g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0.5g<br /><br />Polyunsaturated fat 8g<br /><br />Monounsaturated fat 4.5g<br /><br />Cholesterol 0mg<br /><br />Sodium 220mg<br /><br />Total Carbs 4g<br /><br />Dietary fiber 3g<br /><br />Sugars less than 1g<br /><br />Protein 9g<br /><br />Calcium 2%<br /><br />Iron 8%<br /><br />Vitamin E 40%<br /><br />Niacin 10%<br /><br />Folic Acid 20%<br /><br />Phosphorous 25%<br /><br />Magnesium 25%<br /><br />Zinc 10%<br /><br />ingredients:<br />Sunflower kernels, Partially hydrogenated soybean oil, Salt."
Tang drink,I had been looking for Tang for a long timeand finley found it on Amazon. Thanks.
OK but wrong shape,"I had assumed these would be shaped like rods to enable a baby to easily hold them - they are in fact shaped like regular cookies, two inches in diameter, and our grandson is still unable to grasp them.  Their content seems to be fine, but until his fine-motor skills improve they won't be very helpful."
"The best energy drink, but super overpriced.","I think that almost everyone would agree that Sugarfree Red Bull is, without considering price, the best diet energy drink there is.  The flavor is great.  A bar at my university had a $2 (sugarfree) Red Bull & Vodka special... probably the best drink special that exists anywhere.<br /><br />But price is a big consideration, and $2+ for an 8 ounce can is ridiculous.  For everyday waking up/making it through the day energy I've switched to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A"">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>, as 30 cents per pill is much better for my budget.<br /><br />But if a can is free, or if there's a good special on it, I'll never pass up a sugar free redbull and vodka at a bar, my day has been made.  I just wish that Red Bull wasn't so expensive."
Delicious Healthy Treat!,"After trying a sample of the Almond Trail Mix Bars, I immediately ordered a pack of 12.  They are so moist and delicious, you won't want to eat just one.  They taste nothing like the bland, healthy treats I have tried in the past.  I shared these with my family and the 12 pack was gone in 3 days.  I highly recommend them."
the best,A justifiably award winning olive oil.  Clean clean tasty wow.  I did an olive oil tasting at my house and this was a consistent favorite.  Buy it!
Great Tomatoes,"Just spoke to Muir Glen customer service (12-21-2011) and they advised that if the ""Exp Date"" on a can of their tomatoes is dated March 2013 or later, the inside can liner is probably going to be copper-colored, which means the liner is BPA free.  If the Exp Date is earlier than March 2013, and/or the liner is white/clear, that liner is not BPA free.  But there could be cans out there ""Exp Dated"" earlier than March 2013, which are also copper-colored/BPA free.  If you're buying from a retail store that does not turn over products quickly, note that Exp Date.  If it's somewhere in 2012, you may have a white-lined/BPA leaching can.  I think it must be understood that Amazon may not receive these directly from the processing plant, thus Amazon may not control which product they receive.  However, I received 12 28 oz cans MG Fire Roasted Crushed from an Amazon MidWest Dist Ctr 2-3 months ago, and all of my 12 cans had the good/copper liner.  Regarding damaged/dented cans; I suspect that if you get any cans from Amazon that are dented, they were not dented from Amazon to you.  I suspect the cans were dented from the distributor to Amazon.  Also, MG customer service told me that Muir Glen will NOT label their cans BPA Free until they are sure there are NO white-lined cans out there - could be another year or so.  When they are sure all the cans of MG products are BPA free, then they will label their products ""BPA Free"", as this will obviously be a very positive selling point.<br /><br />Regarding rating these tomatoes, they are surely a 5 star if anything ever was.  How could you beat organic in a safe container and great tasting?  Muir Glen is to be commended for their approach to serving their customers with intelligence, honesty, and in a manner which encourages and promotes good health."
dog kibble,My 2 dogs love the Halo Spot's Stew natural dog food.  They have not grown tired of it and have it every day.  Recommend it at least 4 stars
Not even a hint of passionfruit,There is not even a hint of passion fruit nor mango in this tea. One can only taste an overpowering amount of rose hips and citrus peel.
My dog LOVES this stuff!!!,My dog absolutely loves this food. He is about 14 years old and has been picky in his later years. This stuff he eats and eats until he is full! I am so happy I took a chance on this dog food!!
AWESOME!,I ordered a case of these for our fourth of July party. They made it to Afghanistan in perfect shape. Naturally the 12th bag was designated as the test sample. These chips are excellent and arrived undamaged.
Wellness Super5Mix Adult Health Small Breed Formula Dry Dog Food,"Great dog food for the smaller dog.  I have two very picky Shih Tzus and they loved this kibble right from the start.  The kibbles are small, which are easier for the little dogs to eat.  My dogs both suffer from itching allergies.  These have all stopped since changing to this dog food.  I also have purchased the Wellness brand treats too and my dogs love them also.  I highly recommend this dog food!  Pet Food Direct is pretty fast on their shipping also when you buy through Amazon."
Tully's French Roast,"This coffee has turned out to be my very favorite in K-cups.  It is the best of the ""bolds""- full-bodied, rich tasting and is a great way to start my day."
GREAT SMELL. BROWN WATER.,"Sooooo disappointing. The coffee smells great but what emerges from the coffeemaker is what my mother used to refer to as ""dishwater."" In fact, that's actually kind. I added cream, as usual, and the liquid turned almost white. This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for ""this side down"" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew. For now, save your money. This stuff makes Dunkin's regular taste like a gourmet blend."
"Great taste and quality, and price too","I started eating coconut oil for anti-fungus purpose. I found this great taste food. Later, I also apply it to my feet to prevent fungus growth. The result has been great. I am now regularly purchasing this product."
Tri paks at a reasonable price,I've tried other tripaks for my 4 oz popper but keep coming back to great northern. I don't mind spending more to get better popcorn but as of yet I haven't found anything that was worth the higher price. The premeasured tri-paks are simple to use and insure a consistent quality.
Reminds me of my childhood,"This candy is fresh and delicious, the nougat candy is soft and melts in your mouth, the almonds are nice and crisp.<br />This reminds me of my childhood when my grandma gave me a piece of this every day as a treat, she owned a very large Italian grocery store and she kept these on the counter. This brand is not the same as those but it tastes identical and is an exceptional candy."
THE Best Coconut Water!,I was looking for a way to hydrate and get more potassium in my diet.  This it it!  There are 1000mg of potassium in just one can and it is delicious.  I have tried quite a few different coconut waters and this one tastes better than all the others by far.
Great Product,"I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.) That being said, my ragdoll usually only eats dry food and my shorthair usually eats the wet food. Amazon delivered this to my doorstep today and I opened a can and fed it right away to see if they liked it. After taking a shower I came back out and it was ALL gone, and my ragdoll was finishing up what little was left. The cat food box says on the front that it was made in a human food facility, but I don't know much about cat food that isn't made in a human food facility. I still appreciate the fact that they are trying to say it is higher quality. I will probably be buying this brand from now on, I just wish Amazon Prime members got it in two days like usual, but it is shipped from pet food direct so :(."
GOOD STUFF,"i love this tea! and it really works! if you drink 4-5 cups, you get more milk in 2 days!"
Dried out almost petrified,Product was way beyond dried out tasted like the shelf life past it was kinda white in some cans where the beef dried out so bad
"Lovely Coffee, Shhh, Here's a Tip!","I loved this coffee and it has an outstanding taste that I am sure will make it a big success! The coffee comes in  15 single serve ready-to-use-bags pr pouches that I found to make a ""strong"" cup of coffee.<br />I split open a bag and discovered that it hold three teaspoons full of coffee. I ripped open a couple of bags and made a 10 cup pot in my MR Coffee Coffeemaker (bought right here on amazon.com and was an ""open-box"" absolute bargain) and found it made a really fantastic pot of coffee. I ended up using it all in this manner.<br />I like the idea of this coffee, it is grown in an ethical manner in Jamaica and also in Africa and Central America)by the Marley family (of Reggae fame)<br /><br />A quick look on their web-site reveals they have several other offerings plus a neat (if pricey) coffee-maker)<br />If you like a great tasting coffee, this is worth a try even though it is a bit pricey!"
A Dessert for Your Mouth!,"The tea bags are quite unique. Notice the triangular shape, which allows more of the ingredients to infuse with the water while steeping. I have to tell you, the aroma of this tea while steeping is like a warm oven baking blackberry cobbler on a winter's day! Heavenly!!! The tea contains hibiscus flowers which lends a somewhat element of surprise to the flavor. The tongue gets this almost sweet taste of the blackberry and vanilla on the tip and top, but back along the sides of the tongue, one is treated to a tart aftertaste. Quite good! I can see me going to this on a winter's day. And especially when you want something after dinner, but don't want the calories of an actual dessert! So yummy!!! I highly recommend this delicious tea.<br /><br />****DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and non-biased review."
Still my favorite :-),"In my humble opinion these are the best cookies EVER. Although I suppose since half of it is marshmallow, ""cookie"" is a bit of a misnomer. What they are is a chocolate cake-like cookie topped with a ring of marshmallow and covered in chocolate. Pricey little buggers, but very worth it. If you are either overly attached to the traditional concept of a ""cookie"" (how boring...) or have a particular aversion to marshmallow (how do you not like marshmallows?????), perhaps Pinwheels are not for you. (Yay, more for the rest of us.) Word of warning: Nabisco only sells the real thing during the winter months when the chocolate won't melt during shipping. During the summer they replace Pinwheels with some nasty confection referred to as Twirls. They look just like Pinwheels but they are coated with brown, waxy, imitation chocolate and are best avoided."
Not for the face.,"I wanted to try this instead of my regular face cleaner. Having a moisturizing bar of soap instead of a gel I pumped from a bottle sounded neater, cheaper, like less clutter in the shower, all around more appealing. Even better if it were an inexpensive, cleansing, moisturizing soap.<br />I thought an olive oil based soap was the way to go and I do feel cleansed after using it. However, I don't know about other people, but it is definitely not for my face.<br />I have normal skin, not already dry or anything, and after washing my face with this, it felt clean, but tight and stripped of all moisture. I looked in my mirror and smiled just to flex my face and saw my skin stretch and wrinkle in areas I'd never even had wrinkles before. I had to moisturize for quite a while to get rid of that look and feeling.<br />Not exactly what you want for your face if you're trying to keep wrinkles at bay and a soft youthful glow. This is not a soap you want to use if it's moisture you're seeking.<br /><br />I will keep using it as a body wash just because I have it and why not, but once it's gone, I won't be buying more."
Always on hand,"Now I can have Parmesan/Romano Cheese on hand for whatever. Rural grocery store does not carry it so I usually have to wait until the end of the month to shop for it in a bigger store. Then if I forget, I'm stuck without it until I can get back to the bigger store. With Amazon I can have it in a few days and it's also cheaper than the store. Great."
Awesome!!!!! and USDA Organic,"I am not a tea drinker, just do it for the health benefits. I add this to my Traditional Med Green Tea to mask the taste of the green tea which I do not like. This chamomile tea is sweet and smells great. If I am bloated or have a tummy ache, I make a cup with 2 bags and it really helps. Subscribe and Save saves you tons of money with this tea. Love that it's organic and USDA labeled too."
The Best to be Healthy,If can't drink coffee this beverage is the best substitute . Great taste and Healthy<br />Try it<br />Maria Dorsey<br />Woodbridge NJ
It's beef jerky ...,I would recommend to stick with the bagged beef jerky. I bought these because I thought it would be much easier to transport with me on the go like road trips but the taste is way off compared to the bagged jerky and I didnt care for it. Very dissapointed in the taste.
Great!,"The best bar's i ever ate,although they came to the wrong address.The box came to my street address<br />but i only get mail at my P.O Box so they were sent the wrong post office & i had to wait longer for them!"
INtersting flavors,"I didn't particularly like this tea, sorry, i prefer after all my teas plain. one taste only !<br />But i kept the nice box for another tea."
Wonderful aroma and rich taste,"This black tea is my ""staple"" morning tea now. The smell and rich taste are a welcomed change from the China Breakfast and Earl Grey."
"Good product, but over priced",My dog loves these treat but in the past 8 months Amazon this item has double in price of the same 1 pound tub. I love my dog but this is outragous. I can see a couple of dollars but almost a $9 increase. I will no longer by this product till the price comes back down. I use to get 3 1LB tubs for $27. Now I get 1 for $19.
The dogs love it.,Nothing wrong with this product as far as the dogs are concerned.  They always want more than just one a day but we try to limit them to that amount for their own good and our pocket book.
Great gift,I got this as a gift for a family member with a green thumb. She loved it. The kit got here quick and the package in perfect shape. Maybe she can show me a thing or two so I can stop killing plant life. LOL.
Oat Bowl Review,"I really like this product. I keep it in my desk drawer at work and eat one every day without fail. I only whish I could find it in the stores. However, when you can find the bowls, they don't have the apples in them. Anyway...great product!<br />John"
K-cup coffee,"Great coffee, this is instant but other than that it is so good, I add no milk and no sugar, calories are high 80 I think but for one or two cups a day it's fine with me. Glad to see that info on the packaging. It came on time, the price was good and will buy again."
Great flavor and convenient size,Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee is one of my top 5 favorite flavors.  The bulk packaging and convenient shipping make it easy to always have these K-cups on hand.
Not as sweet as the Crunchy Nut flakes...,"I'm not a huge cereal nerd having grown up on a steady diet of mostly M&uuml;slix and Kix, with only the occasional box of Trix or Captain Crunch in the cupboard. Though there are six million varieties of cereal products on the shelves, I pretty much stick to the occasional box of Raisin Bran or Honey Nut Cheerios, but of the brands that I do eat I have some very specific likes and dislikes. When I picked this box of Crunchy Nut I was skeptical that it would actually deliver on it's namesake, being crunchy and nutty. For my taste I find that the various nutty cereals usually don't have a very strong nut taste, and the ""crunchy"" varieties tend to lose all their bite after a few seconds in milk.<br /><br />Lo and behold my surprise when I tried the other variety of Kellogg's brand cereal in flake form and it delivered wholeheartedly on both accounts.  This variation, the O's, on the other hand is only slightly crunchy and not very nutty in flavor at all.  I've read a lot of complaints that the Crunchy Nut flakes are too sweet, this is one area where the Crunchy Nut O's excel in that they have a much better balanced sweet flavor.<br /><br />Overall though I found them to be pretty bland.  They aren't coated with all that many peanuts and they lasted (crunch-wise) only a little longer than Honey Nut Cheerios or Fruit Loops before getting soggy.  They're not bad, but not great either.  Probably wouldn't buy them again which is a shame since I enjoyed the flakes version of Crunchy Nut so much..."
Delicious and approcable blend from historic Napa Winery,"A great blend in which Joe Hurliman manages to coax out the absolute best characteristics of each varietal and one that the sum is far greater than it parts.  Were it not for the high price tag, given its obvious edge in complexity and ageability, it would easily replace the Recanati Petit-Sirah/Zinfandel as my blend with which to introduce new wine drinkers to the wonderful world of wine.  The combination of good acidity and balancing fruits make it pretty food-friendly and the wood and tannins combine to make this a real wine with the ability for some nice aging and evolving complexity."
Make poptarts taste like sawdust,"Love these, organic- with tons or real fruit.  Also the pastry portion is much denser and richer than pop-tarts.<br /><br />Downside pricey at supermarkets.<br /><br />Solution- buy them at Amazon by the case.  Don't worry, they will go quicker than you think."
Love this Sticky Rice,I've never made sticky rice before and was worried about not preparing it right.  I used my rice cooker and Voila...no problems.  It was absolutely delicious. Love the light sweetness taste.
Good coffee.,This is the best Donut Shop Blend out there.  Though most k-cups taste a little freeze dried.  Keurig needs to work on that.  I prefer San Francisco Bay Coffee Company.
It's ALIVE!!!!,Shipping was super fast from the seller.  It came in a protected envelope which kept the bacteria from all the harm the post office could muster up.  It was protect so well in fact that after I split my order in half (gave one to my mom to try out too) I can't seem to find it.  The bacteria was alive so I'm assuming it must of ran off.  That envelope was protecting it not just from shipping harm but from the world.  Hopefully once it grows up it will come back.<br /><br />My moms batch of yogurt came out wonderful though.  Better than the store variety any day! We were able to make a gallon of yogurt (that's a gallon a milk if your keeping track).<br /><br />If your new to yogurt making or even a pro grab some today just make sure you lock it up so it doesn't run off once you get it!
do not buy from amazon. buy from local store,I checked the local store. The price is the same as amazon. and you donot need to buy a huge bulk.
Tim tams !,Tim tams are the best thing I ever eaten it is too bad that Tim tams are only available in few places in the states and it is very hard 2 find the only thing I wish for is that there are more tim tams available in grocery stores in the states with all 8 variety of Tim tams<br />That would make me happy !
"Very delicious flavor, the cream puffs with spices","Bananas taste very delicious cream puffs, after the openings have a very strong taste of the banana flavor, the taste is very light. The shape of a box in his pocket contained plum puffs, filled with very full.Amount to enough.Delicious strawberry apple."
Great Breakfast Bar!,Needed something to fill the gap between breakfast and lunch!  Does the job and tastes great!!
"Good variety, a little expensive if not on sale","The box this comes in is quite substantial, and it does a good job of showcasing the different teas. The included jars also allow for a fancy way to display teas while simultaneously protecting them from light/air; lids fit snugly over the body of the canister. You are sort of pigeonholed into buying the 4 specific teas in the set, but they offer good variety and decent value."
Great Value,"This is a great buy/value if you use a lot of sprinkles, which we do...Shipped really quickly and arrived in good condition, I like that the jar is durable plastic versus glass."
Fizzies great for diabetics,"I bought the assorted pack of fizzies as an alternative to the constant water I've been drinking since being diagnosed with diabetes. I think they taste great. They are made with sorbitol and splenda so there is no aftertaste and it doesn't make your blood sugar go up. My favorite flavors are orange, lemon-lime, cherry, and sour apple. They also offer root beer and fruit punch but I think the fruit punch tasted more like bubblegum. I didn't get sick drinking it unlike another person's review. I think it would be a great alternative to diet soda which I can't stand."
the best store bought dumplins ever,I had real home made German Kaduffleglaz 40 years ago with sourbautten these are as close to them. I can eat a whole box myself. I am a chef and added fine chopped onion to  the mix
Nestle hot cocoa mix double chocolate meltdown,"This is such a good hot cocoa mix with more flavor than most because of the ""double chocolate"". I'm frustrated because I haven't been able to find it in the grocery stores any more. So I ordered a whole case from Amazon. Hooray for Amazon!"
Delicious!!,"My friend bought a bag at the Hershey Chocolate Factory last month and we haven't been able to find them anywhere! I asked the company when Amazon would carry them and they said in June!!! Yes!!!  These yummy little crisps are the perfect snack. You have to eat few of them before you ""get it"". The cocoa taste IS there-I'm not sure how anyone could miss it. They are not a super sweet candy type snack. My friend and I both agree they are yummy and I am so happy that Amazon is now carrying them."
Ugh.,"I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I don't have an issue eating vegan friendly foods. I picked up the Dr. McDougall's Miso Ramen because it's somewhat low in sodium. I don't know if it's the lack of sodium, or just the product in general, but this really isn't very tasty. Eatable, yes, but I'm not going to order/eat more."
These cookies are ADDICTING!!!,"Whether your a White Chocolate Latte fan or an Espresso fan, you will love any of the Java Bites Espresso Cookie flavors.  The Almond Mocha has a great almond flavor with coffee and chocolate mixed into one cookie.  Try these cookies in your favorite desserts or just eat right out of the box.  Either way you will love them and want more.  Share a box with your friends while having coffee."
Great to send to troops,Many of our troops try to eat healthy and would rather have granola bars than candy and this was a great item to buy in bulk from Amazon to send to them.
Rave reviews!,"I order these chocolate covered apricots over and over again as gifts and for my own indulgence.  Such plump and moist apricots---never dry or stringy in tecture.  Love both the dark and milk chocolate dipped.  Wish they had white chocolate, too.  An assortment of milk, dark and milk chocolate dipped apricots would be even better!<br /><br />A Very Satisfied Customer"
A definite favorite,Delicious taste---just like a chocolate covered cherry.  I especially like it added to coffee. Will give as gifts this year!
K-Cup coffee Purchassed from Amazon.com,Caribou coffee daybreak morning is a mild coffee for those that do not want a strong first cup of coffee. Good purchase for lite coffee drinkers.
Favorite since I was a child :),"These grits are a staple in my family. You can make them in less than 5 mins, and serve them as is, or add your own extras to make them even better. We are a family of Southerners, and even  mail them to my mother who now lives in San Francisco, CA. I have had these grits since I was a baby, and will until I die. I say that these are wonderful."
Good source of energy.,I enjoy this drink so much that I now subscribe to it so it comes monthly.  It has a refreshing carbonated taste.
Don't Waste Your Time Or Money!,"The main reason I got this drink mix was I'm trying to cut back on my soda consumption. I'm trying to drink more water but get bored with it after consuming so much sugar with soda. I thought this would be a great way to liven up my water.<br /><br />The added vitamins were just a bonus. I couldn't prove if they were really in the mix or not or even if I noticed anything related to them.<br /><br />I did notice that it had sucralose and could sure taste it. The first thing I tasted was that fake sugar. I'm sorry dieter, how the heck can you choke that stuff down? There may have been an after taste of fruit punch, but if there was, I really couldn't taste it.<br /><br />The ad said that it has energy in it. Just like the vitamins, I didn't feel any different or energized after I drank the mix. I did get a major headache, which is from the sucralose.<br /><br />I would never buy this product. But I'm sure there are people out that that will not have a problem with the sucralose or flavor being nearly nonexistent. If that is what you are looking for, you will want this mix. Otherwise, don't waste you time or money.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's."
Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix,The sugarless mix is very satisfactory and it's fewer calories. Go for it.
Works,Received this promptly and in good condition.  It works pretty well.  Wanted to put in under the pot and it would have worked but the combination was too high so put it up on the shelf above the pot.  Drawer seems to drag just a bit so 4 stars.
Love these little guys!,"I received the product for a fair price in a timely manner.  They were wonderful, tasty, and a lot of fun to bake.  Restaurant quality, definitely!"
Great tasting tea,I've been drinking different types of Chai Tea for a long time and this Vanilla Chai Tea is very pleasing great tasting tea. This particular blend in Decalf is kind of hard to find in our local supermarket and I'm glad amazon has it for sale. I will continue to purchase this Vanilla Chai Decalf for as long as it is available. Many good comments from family and friends on this tea.
Tellicherry is the best pepper I have tried,My order was delivered promptly and we are very happy with the quality of these peppercorns! We do alot of gourmet cooking and these peppercorns are so fragrant and enhance every dish we make. We will certainly buy our pepper from this site from now on as the quality and the price are both excellent!! Try them... you will not be dissappointed!!!
Yummy and Easy to Order,"It took me a few tries to get used to the flavor of Organic pumpkin vs. Libby's. However, I now love it and Libby's just tastes terrible to me now.  Both list Pumpkin as the only ingredient. It's hard to believe Organic Pumpkin can have a different taste, but it does.  And the Organic Pumpkin is more available than Libby's so I love that."
Good flavor but false labeling.,"This is not zero calorie nor actually sweetened with stevia! This is sweetened with a sugar alcohol, with a little stevia added. Each can has 50 calories and for a diabetic this stuff raises your blood sugar almost as bad as any regular sweetened with sugar soda. And the sugar alcohol gives you horrible gas. A big thumbs down to their false advertising."
Pepper Beef Steak Way Too Salty,"The Pepper Beef Steak is way too salty and tough.  It's a shame they don't put the nutrition facts on the packaging, but I guess that's intentional, because if I knew, I wouldn't not have purchased.<br /><br />Very disappointed."
Super super sweet,Normally I put 2 sugars and cream in my coffee. Not this stuff. It's perfect just as it is. VERY SWEET
my dog loves these,"My dog loves these treats and it makes me feel good to know these are made in the USA.  I have made a point to buy dog food and treats that are made here.  In my opinion, better safe than sorry, so if I have to order treats on line I will."
Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!,"My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a ""good"" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought ""stuff"", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!"
If you like Kraft Mac and Cheese you will like this.,This is the first product that tastes like the Kraft Mac and Cheese.<br />I usually end up eating the whole thing in one sitting.
Flavorjunkie,This is good coffee.  I was buying this coffee at a grocery store and then they quit selling it. I am glad I found it at Amazon.
Wat - AAH ! Bottled water for kis,I think this is a great idea! Kids need to drink less sugary beverages and more water.<br />It goes hand in hand with Michelle Obama campaign to fight obesity for kids.<br />The bottles look great and it is healthy for them!
Multi Grain Chips good!,"These chips are very good in taste and with more than the usual grams of fiber, a good choice.  They came very fresh and in good shape--no crushed bags."
Was looking to replace TJ Dutchess Grey Tea. Way dissapointed!,"The reason why I went looking for Lady Grey Tea is because in December Trader Joe's discontinued their Dutchess Grey Tea. This was one of my all time favorites. So I did some research and ended up at this product and bought the 6 pack box. It's NOTHING like Dutchess Grey. Dutchess was deep, dark and flavorful while Lady Grey is bland and kinda watery. It reminds me of 7-up actually. I'm not sure what everybody else is raving about. Anyway, if you feel you must buy it, I suggest just getting the one box to try out first."
BEST ORANGE FLAVORED TEA I'VE EVER TASTED!,"I tried this orange tea once and I was hooked.  The only problem is that they don't have this tea in my area.  Thankfully, when I checked Amazon they had it and the price is excellent.  The tea is caffeine free and I have purchased this from Amazon two times now and the shipping is fast and the tea is fresh.  Don't mistake this tea with the one that says orange spice because that one is more spicy and not as mild and good as the orange.  I use a teaspoon of honey in mine and it's the best ever!!!  I would HIGHLY recommend this tea!!!"
"not bad stuff, but I have serious questions","Coconut water is the liquid inside an unopened coconut. It is not ""coconut milk,"" although there is often confusion about that. Coconut milk is made from the meat of the coconut after it is opened and the water poured out. Inside the coconut, the water is sterile and very benign to the human body - it has been safely used in emergencies as IV fluid! (Straight out of the coconut, that is, NOT from a Tetrapak.)<br /><br />Coconuts in general are very healthy items. In the South Pacific the coconut palm is called ""the tree of Life,"" because it provides so many things for a healthy life: food, water, shelter, medicine, etc. Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet, but has been the victim of intense propaganda campaigns by corporate vegetable oil cartels and other evil critters.<br /><br />Coconut water tastes (to me) a bit like very watery, unsweetened tapioca, with just a hint of sourness. It is quite bland by itself, but mixes easily with fruit juices, etc. It has great health properties and is rapidly becoming popular with athletes as a superb isotonic drink, because it has great electrolyte and mineral properties, and is a natural food with no harmful side effects or hideous chemical garbage masquerading as food.<br /><br />Good organic coconut water is very hard to find, but there are many brands of non-organic like this one on the market. I checked out the package info and vendor's web site, but could find only general information on coconut water and its benefits, nothing specific about this exact product - where and how it is grown and harvested, the quality of the land and processing, etc. That is not a good sign.<br /><br />For an item that is very health oriented, the only reasons I can see for hiding that information are pure marketing ignorance, or knowing that the truth would not paint a good picture. Rain forests are reportedly being cut down for coconut palm plantations, especially those dedicated to unhealthy corporate factory farming practices. It would be vital for a company to distance themselves from that kind of activity by using only properly grown plants on healthy, environmentally sound plantations, and making that a very prominent part of their marketing.<br /><br />It would also be vital to play up everything possible that points to a healthy product by specifically mentioning those things about this specific product, not just general properties. This company doesn't do any of that, so I can only assume that this product is not produced in a way they want me to know about. That is the kiss of death for a product in my eyes. Granted, I am fussier than most in this regard.<br /><br />Don't be misled by the ""100% Natural"" marketing hype. That means virtually nothing. It is not a strict, legally defined standard, as is ""USDA Organic,"" for example. Virtually anything found in ""nature,"" i.e. toxic heavy metals, MSG (yes, it occurs in nature), animal manure, etc., can be considered ""natural"" and can legally be included in a product labeled ""100% Natural."" Granted, USDA organic standards are very weak as organic standards go (compared to say, Oregon Tilth), but they are still better than nothing.<br /><br />While I love coconut and want to give this product 4 or 5 stars, the complete lack of honest information about its origins and processing make me VERY, VERY suspicious. Without more information about how safe/healthy the product actually is, I can only give it 3 stars and a serious ""caveat emptor."" It is probably much better than any ordinary ""sports drinks,"" but there are too many unanswered questions to be sure. One's health is not something to be treated lightly.<br /><br />UPDATE July 2009:<br /><br />After continued searching, I still have not been able to locate a consistent source of organic or Fair Trade coconut water. While the manufacturer of this coconut water still does not give out any real information about the growing, harvesting, or other relevant details of production, neither do any of their competitors.<br /><br />So far, this is still the best coconut water I have been able to find, and I continue to drink it, even with the questions I have."
Tastes great?  Really?,"OK, let's start with the most important aspect of a performance drink - does it do what it advertises to do.  For me, the answer is a resounding YES.  Cytomax does everything the marketing department says it does for beating the burn and fast recovery.  I've been using this stuff off and on since the product came out, first discovering it in a local bike shop.  Once in a while, I tried another brand because of their marketing or the advice of a cyclist/athlete.  Every time, I came back to Cytomax; it's the only one that seems to do the job (for me).  The one disagreement I have with the other reviewers, and this is a matter of personal preferences, is that it does not ""taste great"".  Not even close to great.  Orange?  Really?  Whatever.  Tangy?  Pffft.  To me, it tastes like a flat diet soda. If that sounds appealing to you, dive in.  I mix it with green tea instead of water, my version of an Arnold Palmer, and it is reasonably presentable to the palate.  Use Luzianne Green Tea and you get the added benefit of antioxidants.  Yep, Amazon has it.  The 1.5lb Cytomax container provides 27 servings, or about 9 rides, so you may need to buy more than one.  Additionally, if you live in a humid locale, like I do, it has a short shelf-life once opened, turning quickly into a big rock.  Buy a size that will get you through a month.  You might pay a little more for three 1.5lb containers, but that's better than throwing away half of a 4.5lb because it soaked up all that moisture and is now useless.  Yep, I've been there.  Grrr.  Get the big bottle if you are an animal, share with others, or live in Colorado.  Where it's dry.  Now go ride!"
"taco bell sauce, jalapeno flavor","This Taco Bell brand jalapeno flavored sauce is really good and creamy. Great on tacos, burritos or any type of food that requires sauce on it. Not too spicy, just a gentle flavor of jalapenos. I don't care for jalapenos, but this was really good. Thanks for sending this to me!"
Rexie loves these and they get some calories into him too!,"Rexie recoils from dog food, all 4 and 5 star kibble and canned!!  I am not sure what to do about making sure he is getting adequate nutrition since he eats steak, lamb and chicken and a few extra supplements and snacks.  If anyone knows of a dog vitamin/mineral supplement  that is really complete for a 10 lb dog, let me know.  I have tried Solid Gold powder which he loves, but it is only to be used with a balanced diet and not really complete.  Others say the same thing when I call."
"Good, but noodles at bottom","The soup is really good, but the noodles all end up at the bottom which makes it feel more like chicken broth.  Still pretty good."
Loves the taste; Did Nothing for Sensitivities,"I had read a lot of great reviews about this food. My kitty has had a lot of dry spots around her head that cause a lot of itching since I brought her home from the shelter. At first, I thought this had been related to the flea infestation she suffered from when originally brought to the shelter. When it did not go away after a few months, I decided to switch her food to something organic. Spot's Stew for Sensitive Cats in the seafood flavor was my first stop. Although Jemima loves the flavor, the dry spots on her head and neck region continue.<br /><br />This food does seem to have an appeal flavorwise. She started wanting to eat a lot more when I switched her to this. Clearly, she must love seafood more than a chicken and rice blend. With the exception of her skin still being excessively dry with the sore spots, her coat is gorgeous and she has not had any issues with throwing up.<br /><br />Jemima recommends this for organic snobs like herself."
Mediocre Tea,"The main benefit of this ""tea""(a list of actual ingredients for this drink is apparently non-existent, so the viability of this ""tea"" is questionable) is the Ganoderma extract it apparently contains, as the taste leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The distributor I got this tea from claims the teabags can be used 2 or more times, but I found that getting even one cup of decent tea out of the teabag was a challenge.<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy, but boring ""tea"", this is definitely the tea for you!<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy and fuller tasting tea, I would pass this one up."
The Best Instant Anywhere!!!,We buy this all the time and bought it here because it was slightly cheaper than the store and was a present for someone.  Normally buy it in bulk of 1-- off the starbucks.com site.
Smooth Sweet Chocolates,"This chocolate assortment is delicious, rich, smooth and creamy as only European chocolates can be. Small sticks of chocolates are individually wrapped, each one with a creamy filling. I love to buy them and pass them out after dinner. Everyone enjoys choosing their favorite flavor and the small sticks are a satisfying low calorie treat."
Not for household consumption,"Lavazza Super Crema in this configuration made terrible esspresso, terrible french press, terrible moka pot and the worst (outside of Folgers) drip coffee I've ever paid for.  At $30 per bag on average I thought I'd get a deal with the great reputation and taste of Lavazza that I'd experienced in restaurants and coffee shops.  Something must have happened to this shipment to ruin the flavor of this coffee.  I could not get a crema on any of the preparations I used, despite using a burr grinder, spice-grinder etc. I feel as though I tried everything but a $2000 espresso machine and grinder to get a good cup...to no avail.  DO NOT BUY this product.  Stick to store-bought Lavazza or the great reliability (albiet more expensive) Starbucks etc.  If I could get my money back, I would.  I bought three bags with a grand total of $91 invested thinking it would be a great hedge against rising coffee prices.  I reapeat, DO NOT BUY this product."
Most broken,"Would have been great for baking or making ice cream, as most of the mints were smashed beyond all recognition."
I bought these by accident,"I thought I was buying the milk chocolate and started eating this crap. I didn't even know they made a dark version, what a let down."
Miracle honey,"I have used this honey for paper cuts, sore throats, acid reflux. As a mask for my face. Leaves the skin feeling super soft and helps with acne break outs. I tell anyone who will listen about the many uses for this honey. It is a little pricey but I figure its better than the stuff in the pharmacy thats just as costly because you have to keep buying it over and over because it really doesn't work as well."
good formula,Its a good formula but my baby refers Emfamil i used this bottles for a while but soon relized that texas is pretty hot durning summer and having to warm all the cold bottles wasnt more me my baby or hot texas weather.its pretty expensive but it is a good product... I would recommend.
"Available online, not at stores","My wife and I love peppermint gum of this brand. For the last several months it has not been available where we shop--Walgreens, Target, Wal-Mart. The other flavors are there but not peppermint. Thank goodness for Amazon's online shopping! The product came promptly in excellent condition. We will continue to reorder from Amazon as long as it's available. Amazon's price was a bit lower than others, and free shipping makes it head and shoulders above the rest."
My Dogs Love It,"I've been through the research and unending label-checking to find a dog food that I was content feeding them, only to find out that my picky eater would turn her nose up at the food.  The other couldn't care less and literally inhales his food.  I went through all the varieties of Nutro, which is a well-balanced food with plenty of whole-meat proteins and whole grains, but all she would eat was enough to stave off hunger.  When I finally decided that I could drop another $10 per bag, I tried Royal Canin and both of my dogs love it.  The ingredients are high quality, the dogs eat it enthusiastically and the size of the kibble is large enough that my ""Inhaler"" chews his food thoroughly before he tries swallowing. It's expensive, but the bag lasts us two weeks with two big dogs eating 5 cups per day.  So, about $30 per week, $4 a day or $2 per dog per day.  I'm okay with that."
Kick it up a notch,"We've had our Kuering machine for over a year now.  We love it.  However, we've had a problem finding BOLD coffee.  Emeril's is very tasty and bold.  While it's not our favorite, it is up there at the top.  Sign up for Amazon's club and save money and postage.  You'll enjoy a very good cup of coffee at a very reasonable price."
"Run, don't walk from this jam!!!!","My boyfriend, who is diabetic, purchased this product from a local grocery store. We both tried and hated it. There is an awful chemical taste during and after ingestion. Not a hint of strawberry flavor to be tasted. Plus it spreads like jello, not jam. Completely horrible!"
Tangy goodness.,"These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many, a handful or two does the trick. Very crisp and savory."
"It's good stuff, better than expected.","I usually buy numi green tea mao feng. And the tea from this k-cups is comparable. Numi tastes a little better, but the k-cup is more convinient. Thus, I am most likely going to buy this tea from now on."
Bags leaked! :(,"I've been pumping and EBF for nine months now and recently switched over to these bags. I had such high hopes for them after reading the reviews and my initial experiences with them were fine. In fact, I love the design and size and the fact that I could lay them flat in the freezer and then move them upright for storage as a space saver. The problem?  I recently had two bags in a row leak. I have never had this happen before with any other bags and it was clear that the leaks were coming from the side seams and not due to punctures or improper sealing of the bags.  The bags were not overfilled or stored improperly.  It is so time-consuming and difficult to pump and try to keep up a decent stash that it was heartbreaking to see my milk go to waste like this. I was so upset that this is the reason I am writing this review -- I'm a frequent Amazon shopper but this is the first time I felt compelled to comment on a product.  I don't know if my remaining bags are okay or not but it's just not worth the risk."
After the gym treat!,"I have recently started working out again and the happy tots are an easy way for me to get a healthy snack in on the way back to the office.  I don't miss lunch and the taste is delicious! The butternut squash makes it super creamy, but the sweetness of the apple sauce helps it go down smoothly -- I love this flavor."
**All 12 cans severely dented**,"One star was given because of the condition of the cans.  Even though there were several reviews about dented cans, I decided to order this mix because I love pumpkin pies and cannot locate canned pumpkin in any store. I wouldn't mind a few small dents but most were severely dented and/or smashed. I am afraid to use them so I am returning the entire case.  I, too, believe the cans were damaged before they were packed, not damaged in shipping.  Maybe the same returned cans are being re-shipped???"
Great Product!,"These are wonderful chips that really do taste like what they say, olives! If you like a very crispy thin chip packed with wonderful olivey goodness and subtle garlic then try these they are awsome! I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty and a little sweet and addictive. The little bags were not enough I was left wanting more but on the other hand the little bags are safer to have around! You will love these I promise!"
Best Mints Ever,"I never write reviews.  Don't care to spend the time.<br /><br />But for these mints????<br /><br />I am a cinnamon freak!  I can't get enough of any cinnamon candy no matter how hot, sweet, or hard they can be.  These are by far the best cinnamon mints that exist.<br /><br />Enough said..."
Stella & Chewy's Freeze Dried Dog Food,"Our small dogs love this food. Comes in small patties, which I break up in their bowls and add water, or for their treats. Comes in a variety of organic meats, and freeze dried, so it stores conveniently. It is good to the last crumb, just ask Tuffy and Georgia."
Does not taste like Venison,"This stuff tastes nothing like Venison Jerky.  The ingredients say Venison, but I don't think it is.  On top of that, it does not taste good at all.  Smells like the pupperoni sticks they sell for dogs.  Yuck."
Zero Rating if I Could,"One of my dogs has allergies and can't have any food or treats containing meat products.  So I thought purchasing VeggieDents was a logical choice and bought then on three different occasions.  The 3rd bag not only contained the Chews, it also contained small white WORMS.  That was upsetting enough, but I didn't notice the worms right away and had given my dogs these chews 2 separate times.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer,and Virbac wanted the bag sent to them to do an investigation.  I sent the bag back expecting a response.  No response, but I received a new package of VeggieDents in the mail.  This was over 6 months ago.  I called Virbac on several occasions, but no one knew about the bag of worms and chews.  No investigation either.<br /><br />No more VeggieDents for my dogs!"
"Don't buy..Not good, absolutely no flavor","This chicory/coffee is ver, very bland, with no flavor of either coffee or hickory.  I am very sorry that I bought it - in large quantity to save on shipping and I'm regretting it.  I wish I can return it, but, I don't want any one else with taste to suffer either.  I don't know what to do!Bottom line, we Americans don't know what true coffee/chicory is!"
My new favorite food!,These are the BEST chips ever!  Really - EVER!  Its like eating a thick potatoe chip but its multi-grain and low in fat...what a great combination!  My new favorite food!  They are very expensive buying them individually at the supermarket.  Sometimes Amazon runs coupon specials and it reduces the price per package greatly.
Delicious!,Every bit as good as from mt favorite coffee shop.  I will definitely order again!  The price was great too!
High quality! Fast delivery!,I received my product much sooner then I anticipated. The merchandise was packaged and delivered in perfect condition. Many thanks!
My Little Friend,"The Duck seems to be the only food my dog can eat without getting sick, but it's hard to find, so when I find it I buy it for him."
Love this product!,"I love this product, so does my son.  It contains less sugar and is easy for my son to grab and eat it.<br />I wish it was less expensive, but it has a lot of nutrients which a baby needs, so I shouldn't complain about it."
fi shock xp-15,"I was all but ready to give up trying to keep my cotswald sheep, because they bust thru everything including my chain link fence. This charger was my last attempt before I sold them. I have bought 3 other chargers before this one, ranging from 1-5 joules. All I can say is this is the first fi shock out of the bunch, and will be the last charger I get. The sheep actually respect this charger. I have had it up and running for a little over a month with only 1 issue. I forgot to plug it in!!!! Hands down best thing out there. The only minor issue I would say is that it could have a longer cord on it. Other than that this unit is great."
love it!,"I love this cereal, it's so hard to find at the grocery store. My wife and I actually ended up ordering 2, because she wanted to surprise me.  But she didn't know I had already ordered it.  My nephew and nieces like it too, so I gave them some boxes. Thanks Amazon, and thanks Quaker!"
Bought for a friend,I bought this bone for a neighbor dog because it was just like the big Nylabones I buy for our dogs.  They just pick them up to gnaw on them throughout the day.  The bones may be left lying around because they don't leave a residue on the carpets.
Great yummy treat for my little ones,I got a border collie puppy recently and have been working on training her. She's so smart so it's nice but she's tiny so most treats are kind of big for her. I didn't want her training treats to take her a bit to chew on. So these are great and trust me she goes BONKERS over them. I wash my hands after the training sessions because she goes crazy over the lingering smell too. I also have 2 cats and they both show up when the bag opens. They have PLENTY of their own treats but they love these yummy morsels. I'll be buying them the Zukes cat treats so they can enjoy them just as much
Always fantastic,My wife and I drink this coffee on weekends as a treat. The coffee is always great....smooth and taste fantastic.
Great Cat Food!,One of my two cats LOVES this and gobbles it down.  The other only likes fancy feast unfortunately.  I love the ingredients and the smell.  It looks just like a can of chicken that any human could eat!  The label says it all--feeding your cat weruva can increase your cat's lives from nine to ten.  Thank you weruva and amazon for providing this fabulous cat food at affordable prices.  Puuurrs!
"Love it! - helps my stress and anxiety, sleep, and blood pressure","I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff.  I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out.  Also losing my hair but I haven't been taking it long enough to tell if that will help with this problem.  But, I'm not on blood pressure meds anymore, and I just feel calm, just as it is called.  Work has, and still is, very stressful, but this stuff helps me get through the day without the need to go home and have a glass of wine, or something stronger, every day.  It does not make me sleepy (I was afraid of that happening at work), but it does help me sleep better through the night.  I'm now hoping that this, in addition to some other things I'm taking, will help with my hair loss."
"Great dog treat, digestable","Great dog treat...unlike raw hide, this product is digestable and won't cause your dog to have the runs"
floorentine panettone,"this product has good cosistancy of fiber formula, well balanced seasonings distributed throughout, smooth flavor in each bite and very compatable with any entree."
Meh...,"First off, the picture is not what the pack actually has.  There are some regular Skittles, some tropical Skittles, and the rest are Fizzle Skittles, which taste like Alka-Seltzer.  For the Starburst, half of them are original, then there are some with very nasty flavors, like banana-kiwi, which is just disgusting.  Overall 2.5 / 5 stars because only half of the pack (all of the originals) were good and the rest I had to give away (too nasty to eat, but fun to watch friends try them)."
Taste great but pricey,"I wish I could find this in store, I REALLY love this but it's nothing too spectacular that you cant live without but if I got an endless supply for free I'd take it ;) Its definitely delish but it is kinda pricey so I buy it now and then. I love both the original and chocolate PB"
"Great tasting and a good kick, without making me shaky","I've been drinking No Fear for around about 6-7 years now.  I've tried numerous other energy drinks (during a long period when No Fear was unavailable as they changed distributors), and nothing has ever even come close in flavor and kick.<br /><br />Like all energy drinks, it probably is an acquired taste for most, but after a couple cans you'll be hooked.  Energy drinks are highly personal, but for me, I've always gotten a solid, long-lasting kick from No Fear, without the shakiness, nervous energy and inability to concentrate I've experienced with other drinks.<br /><br />Currently you'll probably only find this stuff on the shelves in Arizona as they expand their distribution, so a case of 12 might be quite a leap for a new drinker.  I'd suggest trying several cans over a few days before you decide if you like the stuff!  On the off chance that you don't want to finish your case, send it my way!"
Barely any chips in the bag!,"Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didn't realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware - might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn't cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up."
best curry powder,"curry lovers search no more.  Rajah Madras Curry Powder is the best.  have been using it forever both in England and the US.  Best flavor, best heat!"
great pretzels,tastes pretty close to the real thing..unfortunately the ones i ordered came in a little stale. ive ordered them from gluten-free website before and they tasted fresher.
Great Tasting Dark Chocolate - I'm a fan!,"As I get older I prefer darker chocolates to the more sweeter milk chocolates I liked as a younger person.  Now I find it hard to get tasty dark chocolates that are made with the quality you would expect for the price.  Dark chocolate in high percentages - 50 to 70% cocoa (or higher) are usually fairly pricey.  If you are planning to look for organic on top of that, then expect to pay even more.  I was very excited to try Newman's Own Organics Chocolate - not only is it a trustworthy brand name, but Amazon's prices make it the perfect fit for my dark chocolate cravings.  I feel a lot less guilty about buying high quality, thanks Newman's... thanks Amazon."
my chihuahaus like them,"but they liked the chicken wrapped sweet potatoes better. The do love bacon (from the table) but they weren't as enthusiastic about these. Don't get me wrong, they did eat them but you could tell they liked the chicken better. When they DON'T like some treat, they let you know because they won't touch it."
Delicious,I am not really much on reviewing candy but these are far by the best gummi bears I have ever eaten.  They are soft and not overly chewy to where you need to work like a cows mouth to chew them.  The flavors are all good and I read somewhere there was a banana flavored but I couldn't really tell there was one.  I don't usually eat candy until I have a stomach ache but that was my reward for eating so many.  Even with my stomach in pain I had to eat at least one more to be satisfied.  My kids don't really eat much candy but loved these and since they are easy to chew for them they like them even more.  If you love gummi bears this is probably your best option but when I bought mine I did not realize there were two bags so now I have quite a bit to go through.  Just keep in mind that they are easy to get carried away with when eating.
"Soft, Chewable, Yummy Treats for Your Aging/Arthritic Dog","I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better."
Better then store brand beef sticks.,"These are realy great.  They have a nice tangy smoke flavor, that goes great with the heat.  They're also alot less salty then other beef sticks I've had.  I guess they use the smoke to perserve them.  Instead of using lots of salt.<br /><br />The heat is not super intense.  It might be to much if you are sensitive to heat, but in that case.  Buffalo Bills has a mild version."
Barley Malt Syrup?,"I bought this product for my father because he is enthusiastic about making bread. when it arrived I looked at the bottle and it said ""Barley Malt Extract"" 22 onces, not the Barley Malt Syrup I purchased that was 16 onces. I was very confused, I went onto the Barry Farms website and found this article under sweeteners.<br />well we used it as directed on their website and the bread turned out GREAT. it has a more complex flavor to it and my dad was totally excited about my gift."
Amazingly good,"We've had our Keurig since December and love it.  We tried the Twinings Earl Grey tea K-cups and, although the coffee is uniformly great, we had a bit of pessimism whether a Keurig could ""brew"" a good cup of tea.  The Twinings K-cups more than passed the test and have become a favorite in our household.  The tea is brewed just right, flavorful and refreshing.  Twinings (and Keurig) have become a big hit in our home."
I love Himalayan salt,I will never use regular salt again. It is tasty and strong. They say it is pristine and has lots of trace minerals in it. I hope that is true. I know some animals will walk across a continent to get salt. I am glad to get my salt in this natural form.
super handy,"I love keeping this on hand at all times because I never seem to get through a half gallon of buttermilk before it goes bad, but I like to have it for use in biscuits, breads, and to brine chicken before frying. This stuff is very economical and super convenient. It does require refrigeration once opened, but that's no big deal to me. I mix up batches of biscuit mix and pancake mix in advance, then just add the liquid ingredients when I need it. I can store large quantities in the freezer and whip up buttermilk pancakes for breakfast in a flash. Love it. This is a pantry staple for me."
Organo Gold Coffee from Amazon -  a winner!!,Love this product and enjoy the taste.  I recommend only one per day<br />as it does have a de-toxifying effect. The Latte tastes wonderful and<br />is a personal favorite. The Organo Gold Black Coffee has no bitter after<br />taste at all.  I normally use creamer but could drink this without it if<br />I had to. Will order from the same seller as before and probably buy the<br />Organo Gold Black since it is a little more economical with 30 packets<br />per box. Excellent product and great taste!
This one I liked,"I had the opportunity to try the Sweet Tea version of this prior to trying this one.<br /><br />After tasting the sweet tea one I was a little disappointed. However, I was intrigued enough to give this one a shot. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It had a nice flavor to it. It wasn't over powering but it wasn't completely dilluted water either.<br /><br />The delivery of this product is very good. It's a small compact bottle. Easy to use. You can add more/less flavor to suit your tastes. Personally, I hope they expand their flavor options. I would willingly try different flavors. The sweet tea one isn't for me, but this one certainly is."
Great green tea,"My husband works a high stress job. He comes home at night and instead of a glass of wine, he now has green tea. Naturally his online studies after work have improved and he sleeps better. Thanks. Phyllis"
A little stale,"I usually love these, but somehow, on arrival, they were actually a little stale.. although the dates were good.. I would not buy them again through Amazon.. We could still eat them, but when I have bought them in the store before, they were nice and crisp.??"
"Delicious, says my cat; messy, says I...","It's a cute idea to produce a cat food that is similar to people food, and Petite Cuisine seems to fill the nutrition needs of cats, if you can believe the label. However, the ""in sauce"" makes things a little messy, especially with the ""Chicken Pot Pie"" entree. There's so much sauce (aka gravy/water/whatever) that my cat would pull the pieces of food out onto the floor and slurp up the sauce afterward. There's just too much liquid in this cat food. The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.<br /><br />Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication. And I have to admit it smells pretty darn good, not like a lot of cat foods. (Of course, funky smells have never bothered my cat -- the more odorous the better, in her opinion). The daily serving size suggestions are a bit too generous:  1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight. That means 3 to 6 cans for an 8-pound cat, and if you've got a healthy 10-pounder, that means 4 to 8 cans a day? No way.<br /><br />I don't think we'll be using this as a daily food, but rather as an occasional change of pace. It's certainly palatable, but the messiness is a negative. I say 3 stars, and my cat says 5, for a 4-star average..."
Ideal for traveling,"Those bottles are ideal for traveling. Unlike the 2 oz bottles, they don't come with a ring and nipple. However the same ring and nipple fits both bottles. Since my baby only likes silicon nipples, I use the Evenflo ring and nipple and they fit well.<br />If you're not using the Similac nipple, avoid twisting the ring too tight, to allow some air to enter the bottle as baby is drinking, and you need to interrupt baby's drinking every now and then to let air in the bottle. However if you're using the original Similac ring and nipple, baby can drink non stop as the air enters the bottle regularly (Similac nipple has holes designed for that). Hope this helps!"
great stuff,"my first and only visit to the islands I was introduced to this coffee in a local walmart and i found it to be mild and gentle yet still have an amazing hazelnut coffee flavor that almost does not require any creamer to be a delicious and palatable morning treat.  i have not found a coffee like this since returning to the states, tho many other brands advertise as being ""kona hazelnut.""  i believe you would not be disappointed if you tried this coffee."
TOO HIGH PRICED..I'M VERY SAD...,TODAY I FOUND THIS SAME PRODUCT IN THE TOP'S ADD FOR 13.99 FOR 15.5 POUNDS THAT FIGURES OUT .90 PER POUND..I PAID $ 1.52 PER POUND..I REALLY FEEL I WAS JIPPED....
Love this stuff!,"I've been using Ultra Gel for 10 years. It makes great gravy, keeps my salsa from going runny, thickens soups, and lets me cut the fat in my white sauces in half! I love my home-canned jars of apple pie filling. And that's not even the full breadth of the applications."
"Quick, easy, and authentic...",Do you have some people coming for coffee in an hour?  Grab this mix and whip up a batch of authentic Irish Scones to wow them completely! Great product!! Thank you Garveys!!!
The best bottled water,"At first, I was cruising Amazon looking for random products to review. What could be less deserving of a review than bottled water? But then I discovered that you can buy Fiji water on Amazon, and that's worth an actual, serious review.<br /><br />At the time of this review, the idea of bottled water is in question. It's harvested in one location, shipped to another location for filtering a bottling, and then shipped all over the world. You've got the plastic bottles and the energy used by the processing and shipping industry. I'm not a 'green' fanatic, but I know a lot of people seem to care about this. Fiji actually goes to great lengths to give back to the environment by way of protecting the areas where they find the water, by planting new trees, and probably other ways. According to their website, they'll soon be carbon negative. Personally, I don't think bottled water is that terrible. When you think about all the other industries polluting so much more, bottled water seems pretty harmless. Nevertheless, some people care, and those people can feel good about Figi water.<br /><br />Now on to taste. Water is water, right? Not when it's Fiji water. This is the single most pure-tasting water available. I've had all the premium brands, but I keep going back to Fiji. It uses a complex filtration system, explained in detail on their website. It is certainly more than glorified tap water. Unbelievably, the majority of bottled waters are tap water from wherever the packing center is located, maybe with a few added minerals for taste. Fiji is one of the few waters that is actually different than what comes out of your faucet at home.<br /><br />Fiji is plenty expensive, but it can't be beat. Enjoy."
not pleased,"these granola bars my be good for some, but in my error i over looked a key word on the description.  pack of 12!  i figured, like the other granola bar orders i was viewing, that it was 12 packs bundle together and there would be 12 of them. looking at the picture of the box is what I did wrong in my understanding of the order.  the granola bars are not worth the $2+ price!  they are very difficult to chew and we had to warm them up just to eat them and even then were not the best granola bar we have tried.  i will not order these again."
Good Flavor,I have been looking for a melon flavor to add to my drinks - this is really good flavored drink mix.  I have been making smoothies with milk but have wanted to get away from adding milk so I only make this with water and it's really good.  More refreshing than with milk and the flavor holds up with water and ice.  I use about 3 tablespoons to 16oz water and top off with ice in a 20oz thermos and sip on it all day. It really does taste like honeydew melon.<br /><br />I've just ordered the mango and will give a review on that when it arrives.  Very good line of fruit based smoothies.
Not your average Spam,"Actually it tastes a lot like the deviled ham that comes in those tiny little cans wrapped in paper, only better.<br /><br />I sliced the turkey spam with my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W26466"">MIU France Stainless Steel Lunch Meat Slicer</a>, fried it and turned it into a yummy spamburger with a little lettuce, tomato and mayo.<br /><br />I also use the slicer to make diced spam for spam salad with mayo, pickle relish, chopped onion and diced hard boiled eggs and it's tasty diced, lightly fried and scrambled into eggs with a little hot sauce.<br />As you can see, I like turkey spam best with a variety of other bland foods.  This because it has a lot of flavor and a way too much salt."
"Light, healthy snack","Very good line of snacks, and this one is my favorite of all the Pirate's Booty items. Plenty of taste, but not overpowering."
Nice Dark Tea,"Nice rich flavor, I like it as an addition to my usual Numi Organic Gunpowder Green Tea! A little expensive, but that seems the norm for organic puerh..."
good if you use the right amount,"brews a pretty good cup of coffee, though I have to use five 2oz scoops for my mr coffee 8 cup coffee maker"
Maple Syrup by Coombs,"the price is excellent and I've done the price comparisons, so I know I'm getting value for my money.  The taste is strong maple and not too sweet for me.  We use it to make maple ice cream and it comes out tasting wonderful."
"Great heavy duty bone, though they smell a once chewed.","These are a great heavy duty bone for vigorous chewers.  Only thing wrong is they smell pretty bad after they have been chewed on a bit.  Normally chewed rawhide doesn't smell much, these not the case.  Still a great value, and I will just live with the smell since the girls love them."
This Nylabone is a great toy for hard chewing dogs,I have a shih-poo dog and she is a very aggressive chewer. She goes through toys in a matter of minutes. The nylabone chew toy lasts a very long time and she loves to chew them in all flavors. Great bone for the money and it lasts and lasts
"Fruity, smooth, rich","The best EVOO under $40. We live in the Bay Area where there are tons of artisan producers of EVOO and this stuff is by far the best in its price range. There are better ones for 50+ for this size but this oil has a smooth taste, silky in texture and a wonderfully fruity and fresh bouquet and taste. Your mouth will definitely love this! Also rated #1 by America's Test Kitchen and Consumer Reports."
Dingo Munchy Stix made my dog very sick,"Please don't buy these for your dog. These have artificial colors and pork in them that is not listed on the product description online. These made my dog very ill. He had diarrhea and was throwing up for a week. I was very worried about him. This was the only change in his diet, I feed him all natural food with no artificial anything. I thought these were made of chicken & natural accourding to the online description but they are not."
Impressed!!!,I was very pleased with these finishing salts. They add depth and one up the presentation factor. Thanks for the quickness of shipping and I highly recommend this product.
Sturdy and decorative,"I purchased this gumball machine to dispense candy at my office.  It is sturdy and easy to work- just add candy in the top and remove coins as necessary.  I was able to follow the instructions to take the machine apart to control the amount dispensed and allow it to dispense without coins (""freeplay"") in about 20 minutes.  The most this machine will dispense at a time is about two small Cadbury chocolates, which works for doling out chocolate to my co-workers. :-)<br /><br />The machine was shipped quickly in sturdy packaging and arrived intact.  The medium model was about the size I expected.  I might get the smaller version if I was going to use this for decoration at home."
YUK!,I am obsessed with kale chip lately so I thought I would try these. They were inedible. I was so dissapointed. I could do wonderous things with Kale Chips but apparently Kaia missed the mark. What I didn't know when I ordered them is that they were topped with what tasted like bird seeds. I tried to give the bag away to several visitors but no one would take them!!! They left a terrible taste in my mouth. The only good thing is that they sent me a free apple fruit roll like they knew they had to make up for the chips.
My dog's favorite!,"My dogs love these! It seems like they are working to keep their teeth clean, so I like giving them to them."
the best ever,i purchased the original biscotti and ate the whole box of them (10) at 1 sitting and then went to the store the next day for more-  they taste just like my mother used to make and i am not kidding  they are the best ever!!!
Better values elsewhere,Check the description before you buy. The price I paid was for a single packet.  Don't assume that because the price is similar to what you might pay for 8 or 10 of these packets at your local grocery store that you are getting more than a single packet. That didn't pan out so well for me and I am returning the item.
terrible,"firstly, the packaging. all of the tubs were opened, plastic cracked, tubs lids do not fit the bowls so they can't actually close and seal the contents, it looked like one tub was eaten out of, apricots missing. Looks like this stuff gets shipped from turkey and they repackage it in Brooklyn into really lousy packaging that does not fit. i used to live in Brooklyn, that place is full of rats. the fact that all the tubs came opened, lids don't fit, and plastic seal is broken is beyond disgusting. i can only imagine under what circumstances they were repacked down there in brooklyn. again disgusting.<br /><br />finally these are not Natural Apricots, they are full of Sulfur Dioxide for preservative. If i could give this mess a negative 5 stars I would."
"Delightful, High Quality Extract","The previous reviewer is clearly confused.  An ""extract"" is the essence of the plant or fruit (orange, in this case), mixed with alcohol.  No alcohol, no extract.<br /><br />That said, this extract is excellent and an astonishing bargain at its current price of $6.99.<br /><br />The aroma is pleasant and, not surprisingly, smells just like oranges.<br /><br />It adds delightful orange flavor to any dish.  I made lemon poppy seed bread for Christmas and, instead of putting all lemon extract, put half lemon and half orange extract.  Every single person who ate the bread said it was the best they ever had.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the confused and uninformed reviewer, this orange extract is excellent."
pleasing plus healthy,Our dogs adore getting treated but one has reactions to some dog treats.  I am satisfied that these treats are healthy and they definately are enjoyed.
must try item,"If you've never tried these rolls but love a bit of sweetness in your bread, these are the rolls to get.  They are so soft and just seem to melt in your mouth.  they make terrific little sandwichs for a snack or a light lunch when you want abit of substance.<br />The absolute best bread to have with some fried chicken.  So if your having KFC, instead of getting a heavy biscuit eat one of these little jewels instead.  You'll find yourself wanting to keep them on hand.  I buy the packages, seperate them into 4 rolls and freeze them. They are delicious!"
Tic Tacs,"I was pleased with the fast shipment, however, they were supposed to be orange tic tacs and they were all white. I didn't know this until the bridal shower when people opened them b/c the package was a dark orange and made the tic tacs appear to be orange too. Too late to send back at that point."
Best tasting Mint tea for the price,"I go thru a lot of this brand, and hope I can find some more cases on amazon."
DOUBLED IN PRICE WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS,"The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online."
Nice and strong - the way I like it.,"I consider myself somewhat of a coffee expert.  I have tried all types and prices of coffee brewed in every type of container (from french presses to drip makers to keurig and pod devices to cappuccino machines).  Most coffee can be made successfully if it is allowed to steep the properly ground coffee beans for the right amount of time at the right temperature.  Assuming you have the temperature and time calibrated right the end product will show its true nature to you.  In the instance if Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, its true nature is quite good.  It has an earthy, exotic, African flavor that is bold and strong - just the way I like my coffee.  It makes for a perfect after dinner coffee - to be enjoyed with friends and good conversation.  I took off one star for the price, as I feel it is a bit overpriced as sold.  Otherwise enjoy this great coffee!"
Just what I wanted,"For the money this is a nice necklace. The shark tooth is a bit small but is still a descent size. One thing worth mentioning is that the necklace uses a simple hook clasp. This means the necklace could possibly fly off during strenuous activity or if you're in the water. But I replaced it with a barrel clasp so it will not come off and this costed only a dime. Overall, this necklace is exactly what I wanted."
"Closest thing to ""real"" bread for the gluten free life","When I was introduced to this bread, the person who baked it became my angel. I've tried lots of gluten free breads over the last 10 years. This one allowed me to actually make a sandwich! A rare treat for me. Freeze two pieces at a time and pop out for toast! Awesome!"
My Favorite Flavor!,"I like the fruit flavored versions of Yummy Earth, but roadside root beer drops are simply awesome. It's better than any other hard root beer flavored candy I've tried. I never get tired of the flavor, and a bag this size can last a long time, sometimes for months."
"Good start on quality, Great price!","I have 3 terriers and one is an allergy dog. She's got both seasonal allergies and is sensitive to food ingredients. After years of treating the symptoms with drugs I started reading about how a ""species appropriate"" diet would help with her allergies. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098253311X"">Dr. Becker's Real Food for Healthy Dogs and Cats: Simple Homemade Food</a> I never knew by reading the label on dog food what was good or bad, now after learning about how dog food is made, what ingredients are most important and what I should avoid, I've started feeding ""grain free"" and as low a carbohydrate feed as I can find commercially. We must be careful that dog food isn't overrun by ingredients that have too many carbs like potatoes (sweet or otherwise) peas and grains. Dogs wouldn't get those in their natural diet unless in the stomach of prey. Be careful, when a food ingredient is listed on the label multiple times, the food is mostly that ingredient. So it could be all potato and not meat. Anyway... In an ideal world I would be cooking for my dogs, but I just don't have the time or the freezer space for that. After much research, trial and error, I've found Merrick's Whole Earth Farms Adult Chunky Loaf Dog Food, to have quality ingredients for a really decent price. While there's a slightly higher proportion of carbs from carrots, sweet potato and peas and a little less in protein, its a good place to start. My dogs love it, it smells good and I rotate this every other day with a higher quality feed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFR4S"">Instinct Grain-Free Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food by Nature's Variety, 13.2-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> to keep my costs down. This line of feed from Merrick is made with high quality ingredients and even though I leave kibble out all day, my pups dance around the bowl at dinner time to get this canned food.  What's nice is that since they don't use grain or too many carbs, my dogs get good nutrition and their stool (yeah it gross but that's a factor in buying dog food) is more firm, small and less odoriferous. sometimes when changing food, you must introduce the new brand slowly so that their system can adjust. My allergy girl is doing well and I only have to treat seasonally when its really bad outside.  If you'd like some help to determine if the food you buy is really good for your dog, I've found www(dot)DogFoodAdvisor(dot)com to be the best place for reviews of both wet and dry dog food. I may not agree with everything they say, but its a wonderful place to start. I know that your 4-legged friend will do well with this brand. The only reason it got 4 stars was that it needs a wee bit less in the carbs."
Works great,"I've had this about a week.  It didn't kick in for several days.  Nothing happened.  Then, the next day, flies covered the top of all the water.  Another day, and they're several layers deep.  Still hasn't really started to stink, as others report."
Surprised and happy,Enjoyed this product.  It is excellent for people that have Diabetes 2. I can now make my favorite pasta dishes
Where's the meat?,"Not good,not bad. Not worth the price. I used it as a base and added a can of shrimp for some flavor."
Yummy!,Love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor.  The price is good and I love the single packs.  This is not a flavor available to me locally.
Love SPORTea!,I have been drinking Sportea for almost 20years. I love the refreshing lemon ginger taste.  Its very thirstquenching & also has electrolytes and ginseng in it.  Its the perfect pre or post workout drink that has no calories and is actually good for you!
My dog would do anything for this treat,"By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!"
will definately buy from amazon again,I was sooo impressed by how this came in the mail.  It was tightly wrapped with bubble wrap (an added bonus- baby's siblings were thrilled) and a lot of heavy tape.  Despite my 8 year old dropping the box in her exuberance to get it to me all the jars were perfectly fine.  I ordered it also with the peas selection and that is what I have given the baby first- but it seems to be the right consistancy and the baby likes it- so it gets a two thumbs up.
A Guilt-Free Indulgence,"Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Bars are especially good for people who are on a wheat-free, gluten-free, and/or non-dairy diet. However, people like me who don't have these restrictions enjoy them just for the great taste! As a big fan of oatmeal, coconut, and chocolate, I know that many products containing these ingredients are not good for me. That's why I'm thrilled that I discovered Pamela's products. I can enjoy what I love without a guilty conscience! Instead of picking up a candy bar, I have a Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Bar instead. Delicious!"
A very mellow peppermint,"I prefer a much fresher peppermint and Stash seems bland or stale to me. For a brisk peppermint, Twinings is far better."
still a favorite,"This was my favorite hot sauce when we lived in California. We relocated to Tennessee in 2000 and this brand was not available locally. I found this sauce available on Amazon and ordered 4 bottles. The prduct has not changed in 10 years, it is a fairly spicy sauce that is not overpowered by vinegar. This is a good general use sauce in that it is lively without being excessively hot."
chemical candy like flavor,"If this had been the first MIO I tried, I wouldn't have risked any other flavor.<br /><br />The concept is great, sugar and caffeine free, portable and an option for people who dislike plain water or who are on sugar-restricted diets. Since hydration is an issue for people who drink too much coffee or soda, it's a great idea.<br /><br />This flavor reminds me of candy more than fruit. How some fruit flavored candies don't taste anything like the fruit they are supposed to be. The artificial sweetener makes the chemical taste worse. I liked the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG"">MIO Mango Peach)</a>, this missed the mark for me.<br /><br />So why two extra stars? My son disagrees with me, and likes the peach flavor quite a bit. He also likes it mixed into homemade yogurt.<br /><br />If you like sweetness and flavor, this maybe better for you than it was for me. I'll stick the Mango Peach when I'm out and want a bit of flavor and sweetness. When at home, I prefer chilled brewed herbal teas to hydrate with flavor."
Good popcorn,I was told this was a good low-fat popcorn to eat on Weight Watchers.  It is good and you can eat alot but there is a funny after taste.  I could not find it in the city I live in so I had to order a whole case.  I don't know if I like it well enough to eat it all.
Herbal tea drinker,"Good, full bodied, cup of tea that does not get bitter, not as fruity as one might expect. Goes well with most desserts and is good at night if one wants something stronger than a mint or chamomille tea"
It works!,"I have used this product for quite some time on and off.  It is easy to use, drink a cup before bed and<br />excellent results in the morning.  It is very beneficial for those times when life gets you out of sync."
Absolutely addictive,"My son discovered these somehow so we purchased some from the grocery store. Yummy. Very salty (but not as much as the buffalo wing flavor), and yes, not as ""good"" for you as the regular pretzel, but hey, they taste 10 times better. Bag gone in 10 minutes. Thanks to the other reviews I now have no fear getting the box of 12..."
My Favorite Chocolate Trifecta,"In an effort to reform my omnipresent sweet tooth, I thankfully have acquired a taste for small, almost daily doses of dark chocolate.  I have tried numerous dark chocloate brands but the one I always come back to is Hershey's dark chocolate assortment.  I love the small thin, little wrapped squares and the smooth, rich taste. Alas, when my favorite squares with the blueberries and almonds are gone I long for them and I am tempted to buy another bag to replenish, but I resist and enjoy the others...almost as much (I sometimes eat them along with a few roasted almonds). I realize Hershey's makes the larger bars with the blueberries and nuts...but it's just not the same as those little thin squares which make it so much easier to constrain yourself. One suggestion for Hershey's:  please give your customers an option to customize the assortment, similar to what m&m's does with the personilized orders - it would make my day :)"
very little foam,"Cappuccinos are supposed to be mostly foam  I got a ""little foam"" on top<br />and practically all milk very disappointing called tassimo and they are sending<br />more milk but I think maybe it might be the machine"
Stick to the original,"Quaker Instant Oatmeal Lower Sugar Maple & Brown Sugar is what you should get if you're interested in this type of oatmeal.  It's still available for purchase and tastes MUCH better than this version.  Skip the box with the picture of the fitness guru giving you 'super' advice and go for the original.  I have no idea what they did to this version but the taste is horrible and very noticeable when you've had the version I've mentioned above.  It's edible, but so are some varieties of garbage, not recommended."
"Good, healthier alternative","We've tried the vanilla and now regularly order the oatmeal version for our kids' snack. Both are very good.  The oatmeal variety has more ""texture"" but our 5 year old still loves them. I also eat them occasionally and also prefer oatmeal; they are sweet but not too sweet and make a great snack!"
the best Caffe ever,"strong ... and fantastic coffee brand... I like it and most of my Italian friends love it.<br /><br />I've made 6 cup of illy coffee in my office, almost whole offices around mine get smell like coffee.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />1. don't drink it late afternoon or evening, you'll have diffcuilty to sleep at night.<br /><br />2. after opining keep it in dry cold area.<br /><br />3. the best time to drink the coffee in early morning and after lunch...<br /><br />best regards,...."
Great kitten food,"My kitten is 8 months old and we've seen such a change in his coat since switching to this brand of food. Previously we fed him the Fancy Feast kitten food and he liked it but after reading horror stories about the ingredients in most commercial cat foods we decided to switch to something more natural. He loves this one too and as previsouly mentioned, we've seen such a change in his fur - softer and much shinier."
Decent Sushi Ginger,"I bought this product because of the 5 star reviews for it.  I did see a one star review that said it was overly spicy, but since I like spicy things I thought I'd try them.  It is a decent ginger product, but is less than restaurant quality (unless you go to a restaurant that serves this bottle!).  It is more spicy than the other ginger I have tried at restaurants, but that did not bother me.  The issue I have with this product is that the after taste is not fresh.  When I first bit into the ginger I thought it was going to be great because initially it tastes just like I remember restaurant quality ginger.  The aftertaste is the disappointment."
"A perfect sweet treat, the best lollypops ever!","I was sent a box of these by a friend in Los Angeles and I have fallen in love.  Of course, since I live in North Carolina, there is obviously no See's store here.  My favorite flavor is definitely the Root Beer, but flavors like butterscotch and vanilla are AMAZING. I never thought that anything like this could ever be consider a lollypop by North Carolina standards, but trust me, once you taste one of these, you won't want to switch back.  They have great flavors, melt in your mouth, and stay with you once you're done, and once you have one, you can't stop there.  A great gift to any friend!"
Beware new formula!,"Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.  The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures).  Do your homework before buying this product.  The company changed the formula without notifying the public.  Would give zero stars if possible."
Amazing!,"Love this stuff! Great product, healthy and received quickly.  Love it so much that I signed up for regular delivery."
seems to work!,"I got this for my cat. Our other cat died several weeks ago, and our surviving cat has been very agitated and upset since then. I put 4 drops in a spoonful of water once a day and put it over the dry cat food. He laps up the water and eats the pellets and is a lot calmer. My cat doesn't have a good sense of smell, and the first time he ate the doctored food he looked a little surprised, but he eats it without a fuss. Definitely worth a try.<br /><br />The regular Rescue Remedy has an alcohol base, and the pet (and child's) version has a glycerine base. All the other ingredients are the same."
Fantastic!,"Despite what the picture shows, you do not get ground mustard powder, it is the seeds. Each pound comes in a foil bag that should last for years if stored in a cool place.<br /><br />I only opened one bag, but I didn't see any ""extras"" in the bag - just mustard seed. This is so much cheaper than buying from the grocery store. I was paying  $2.50 for 1.5 oz there. Here it's not even $4/lb."
Flaxseed,I really like the flaxseed-I use it everyday in my cereal. The product itself is very good. I only have a problem with Amazon when they sent me 2 orders. Thanks.
Sweet potato chews,My dog loves these as a treat!  She thinks she is entitled to one each day and actually waits and barks where we keep them if we forget!
Best green tea ever,"By far the best-tasting green tea i've had. Many are weak tasting, like little more than water. This has an undeniable flavor. Even long steeping time (my preference) doesn't bring out as much bitterness as other green teas.<br /><br />As if the flavor weren't enough to give this 5 stars, it's organic, cultivated by hand, not irradiated, and prepared according to traditional Japanese methods. I'll spare all the details here, but if you will please buy some and read the insides of the box, you'll be just as hooked as i am.<br /><br />Oh, and the tea bag paper is unbleached too. This just keeps getting better!  (Why on earth bleach a tea bag, anyway?!)  Did i mention the price is a steal too, especially for an imported organic product?<br /><br />I don't even drink coffee every morning anymore, if you can believe that. This is a pleasing, comforting hot beverage, and my kidneys are thanking me for the reduced caffeine intake."
good eatin',"this product was recommandet by the dogtrainer. at first i thought it is too expensive, but when you consider that you need to feed much less than of the ""bargain-brand"" it doesnt look so bad anymore. plus there is less waste to pick up. and: the dog likes it. with gasprices going up this is an  additional plus: free homedelivery. i wish i could buy everything this way and be as happy with the product as with this."
Exactly what I needed!!,"This is such a great product. Its the perfect thing to get me started on Indian cooking. I can try some recipes, see which ones I like the most, see which spices I will need the most and save money in the long run. Otherwise I would have to go to the store and buy a ton of full size spices and who knows if I would even use all of them? Some could go to waste. That's why I love this product. Perfectly packaged for me to try out a couple recipes and then I can see what I actually need to get from the store."
refreshing,Tazo's wild sweet orange herbal tea is good hot or iced.  It has become my favorite. I really look forward to relaxing with a good book and some of it iced in the afternoons after work.
Justin's Honey Almond is UNREAL!,Words alone cannot describe the flavor that results from the right combination of a just a few natural ingredients.  All I can say is that you will not be disappointed.  This stuff is fantastic.
exactly what I want,"One of my favourite chocolate in China, however, I can't find it in local store so I find it on amazon! Although there is a one-star review that leads to my hesitation for a while, I ordered this when there is no shipping fees and the taste is exactly the same. Maybe I will order this again later."
Choking hazard for 6 month old,"A piece of this biscuit broke off and got stuck to the roof of my 6 month old grandson's mouth. He was gaging, but I couldn't feel anything in his mouth.  It was terrifying! I finally swept my finger aggressivley in his mouth and found it stuck to the roof of his mouth. This product should be taken off the market."
Waste of money,"Might be good for people sensitive to caffeine, but I was unable to ascertain an effect beyond an initial rush from having shot a mentholated product into my nasal cavity. Much too little caffeine, I believe."
electric fence,Works really well keeps my dogs in fence!  They learned really quick to quit digging out I was having trouble keeping her in she is a boxer/catahoula curr kept digging out everyday but this worked highly recommended!
Kitty cat food,"all these well known brands are now owned by one Big huge company which doesn't really care about what it puts in the food... read ingredients labels.. and you'll be surprised! (we are all duped into thinking our cats are getting great nutrition.. but as it seems we are really just falling for the name brand.. if you read the label it has By-products and the only ""nutrients"" it has in it is artificial vitamins and minerals.. (which your cats body can't digest and use) Now... basic human reasoning would bring us to the conclusion that that the best way to get nutrients is from whole foods NOT added artificial vitamins and minerals made in a lab... soo..  I'd suggest doing a little bit of research on what is really health for your pet.... you'll be happy you did in the long run when you don't have to go to the vet with a cat with one of the many new diseases our Poor domesticated malnourished pets get from the bad food that we give them!.<br />if you can afford it look into EVO or Organic pet food. or even if you have the time try Switching them to Raw.. its the best thing you can do for them and its well worth it..<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />oh.. also... the diarrhea that you speak of is natural for the first week of switching any animals food (dogs and cats).<br /><br />Good luck with finding a good kitty cat food!<br /><br />:-)"
"Well, maybe the tins are a keeper.","This tea is terrible; cheap store tea bags taste better. All of the flavors blend together to make the green tea taste like a mixture of earl gray, raspberry, and peach. This tea is Picard's worst nightmare; maybe only Locutus would drink this. Even Neelix would be repelled. Sorry for geeking out, point is, the tea is not worth your money."
the best,Within a week of using this product my 2 dog's coats were both much fluffier and softer and snugglier. Expensive but worth it!
Great coffee,Better than Starbucks at a great price! I run the packet twice to get a bigger cup of coffee. The coffee has a rich flavor without the bitterness.
old stock,"There was only one in stock--tea bags with strings.  The others were round bags without strings apparently the new style.  The bags were discolored and the tea apparently old, judging from the taste.  Probably my fault for ordering the last one one of a discontinued item.  I have used the tea in round bags and found it excellent."
Not as good!,I usually order the Sumatra coffee but I thought I would try this Dark Roast because you get 2 more pods.  It was not nearly as good as the Sumatra.  Very hard tasting and somewhat bitter.
soothing,"Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is. I will continue to use this tea. I do think it helps with your mood."
Overpriced,You can buy the same bag of chocolate at any Michaels store for $2.99.  I got a ton of bags on sale for $1.99 there!  Don't waste your money or your time waiting for this bag
"I Love my coconut oil, this one especially","This brand is the best I have come across.  I will continue to order their products.  The smooth taste and smoothness of the product do not compare to others.  I am using coconut in replace of my canola oils and butters...it helps in so many area's...its so worth trying...on so many levels.  Pick up a book while your at it too, about the benefits of coconut...so worth it..."
Pleasantly Surprised,I purchased this based solely on the reviews (highly unlike me) and I have to say I have not been disappointed with this product.  I do not recommend using a lot of it at first.  I suggest using a little bit at a time to learn your tolerance and avoid getting an upset stomach.  If you are trying to use less sugar (or no sugar) give this a try.
Excellent dog food!,This large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog. It's also worth purchasing this larger sized bag (or get two of them at once) in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time.
teaching cookies,These cookies are just enough when you crave a sweet little snack.  My 3 yr.old granddaughter likes to say the letter<br />before she pops it in her mouth.
5 seconds flat,I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.
Too Strong,"I LOVE honeybush tea.  However, this is too strong and a little bitter.  So far my favorite brands are Stash & Numi.  If you get Stash, make sure to get the tea bag and not the lose tea.  Their lose tea have a lot of sediments due to fine tea leafs.  I heard that Numi lose tea is bigger but haven't tried it yet.  Anyhow, I would not purchase this again."
Needless entry to a crowded market,"With the rush of `flavored water' drinks on the market I decided to give ""Vitamin Squeeze"" a try. I will admit to a level of apprehension but thought it could be really good. There are a lot of them.<br /><br /> Opening the cylinder the concentrate was a light red color that looked like Hawaiian Punch and had a faint scent like Kool Aid. OK I thought, so far so good. I poured out a small glass of water. Following the directions added a squeeze of the syrup.<br /><br />It had the color of Hawaiian Punch  but was cloudy, still had the same scent. So far so good. Then I tasted it. there was a faint fruity taste but also a chemically taste that was less pleasant. ""Maybe I didn't use enough."" I added another squirt hoping it would increase the flavor. It did. Unfortunately the wrong flavor. The fruit flavor had faded entirely, overwhelmed by the chemical flavor. In short, bleah!<br /><br />The label says ""Nutritious & Delicious."" Well they may have gotten one of those right but to quote John Lithgow in the movie ""2010""  ""If it has to taste like this, I don't care if my electrolytes are balanced."""
Best ever for serious dark choc fans,"This chocolate is absolute heaven on earth for hard-core chocolate fans. This is not your sweet and creamy hershey's though. I actually prefer the 70% dark as I like my chocolate a little sweeter; but, I think this stuff is yummy anyway and my sister and mother LOVE this stuff!!!!"
These are the best!,I love these bars and run out of them quickly. I don't feel guilty about this snack - they are tasty yet healthy.
Horrible Texture!!!,I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they really really bad. Good luck to all who are brave enough to gamble their $$$
"Kibble is not ""softer""","I got this for my 12 year old cat who stopped eating his regular dry food, as the kibble was a little too hard for his teeth.  I ordered this because it was described as having soft kibble, but was just as hard and looked exactly the same as the Science Diet I had been feeding him.  He eagerly went for the food when presented, but stopped eating it after a few bites because it was too hard.  Luckily, I didn't buy a huge bag, as this food is expensive."
Best dry cat food and I've tried a lot of them,"I've been feeding my cats EVO for about three years.  Before that I was changing food about once a year.  I have three cats and my older cat is a picky eater.  When I fed her this food she immediately liked it better than any other food I've given her.  She also had a LOT more energy.  It was amazing!  I couldn't believe it.  She started running around the house, chasing the little fur mousies and batting them around.  My other cats like it and do well on it too.  This food is 50% protein so beware of the warnings to consult a vet if your cat has kidney problems."
Rocky Road,"Slightly upset that the candy box was open but not the candies weren't. Just the candy box. This is a gift to my father and it is his favorite candy in the world. I do hope that he loves this candy that I'm sending him, cause he has to travel for over 1 1/2 hour drive to buy Rocky Roads. See how he loves them. Well Happy Holidays."
Great Deal!,The Gloria Jeans K cups were a huge success for my live-in guest during the Thanksgiving Holiday!  Ready when they were.  The price was the best around!  Thanks!
Dog Show Crack,"Bought this at a dog show vendor.  If I'd have known how much the dogs would love it, I'd have bought lots more than I did.  And so, here I am, hunting it down...<br />  We used it for Nationals week and constantly went back to it for dog show bait.  Super easy to break into very tiny pieces and the dogs can't resist it."
Yummy!!!,"I have to eat a completely gluten free diet and these fruity burst crispy bars are just great!!  I love them, they have bits of fruit in them and taste sweet & great!!  I take one as a snack with me to work almost every day.  I give these crispy bars 5 stars and will defiantly buy them again!"
You learn something every day,"I always thought aerators and decanters were BS.  We drink premium wine and it never bothered me to just dump it from the bottle down my gullet.  Someone gave us one of these as a gift and we tried it.  It actually works!  The wine is smoother and the upfront bite of some reds is eliminated.  We like the little holder for it, so we can keep it right by the sink since we're usually on a drip-feed of wine all evening.  I'd forget the big holder -- more junk for the countertop.  Oh, did I say -- it actually works!"
I sneak it in!,"My youngest loves this flavor straight out of the pounch and my older kids enjoy it without even knowing.<br /><br />My youngest often takes this in her lunchbox to preschool to enjoy during the day since she can recap it as many times as she would like.<br /><br />For my older kids, this is my favorite product to hide in all of their ""treats""!  The apple & cherry flavoring is delicious in smooties, brownies, cupcakes and makes everything healthier."
NOT SATISFIED,"I was trying to give the product the benifit of a dought for 11 or more days to be sucessful.<br />Well i still haven't trap a gopher but i can surely say i have alot more holes in the lawn,<br />pretty impressive. i do not advise anyone to buy this product. I had better results using gas bombs<br />a little more expensive but atleast i got results!!!!"
The Best Stuff to use,I am a Backpacker and when I go on backpacking trips this is a great product for me to bring along.
PopChips,"This is a great product for those attempting to loose weight.  I currently participating in Weight Watches, they have a product that is similar but with less taste.  I prefer the popchips because of the flavor and it counts for the same amount of points in Weight Watchers.<br /><br />Thank you."
Yuck!,"I have ordered Breakfast Blend over the last three years.  The last order I received through Amazon was just awful! Bitter, burnt, undrinkable.....what are they doing to my once favorite coffee??"
NOT involved in the recall,I have used this Wellness fish formula for 8 years for my dogs. This food is a super high quality food for dogs as well as having some healing attributes that make it very healthy for seizures and liver issues. My Schipperke's are doing very well on this formula and no longer require Phenabarb or any seizure medication and the liver studies on their blood work are almost normal at 13 years of age after serious liver problems 8 years ago.<br /><br />Wellness tests All batches for problems prior to distribution. They did give a voluntary recall on the puppy formula even when it tested out with no contamination. I also feed the senior dog formula to my 100 pound German Shepherd dog as I believe it has given him wonderful joint health help as he ages.
confusion amongst them,sometimes seeds dont germinate well. no biggy for 7$ when seed packs from most dealers like burpee will cost on average around 2$ so you spend 5$ for a nice planter. one with a low profile to keep the cats from KOing it onto the floor and rolling in the dirt... my cats dig my mums out when i bring them in from the cold. and they knock my smaller pots down so i will be purchasing these types of products to distract them.<br /><br />i believe the cat grass is an annual and wont keep growing and growing.<br /><br />but then i didnt research this. if the cats eat it all down it might die just like grass that is cut too low. but wouldnt it come back. i will have to pull my books out.
Great for long distance cycling,"Been using this product for over 10 years on long distance rides, including centuries.  Have tried them all.  As another reviewer said, this isn't a ""tasty"" drink to have on the patio, but if you want to keep your legs from cramping, this stuff WORKS!!  I won't go on a long ride without it."
Quick and easy,"This is very good for a quick and easy meal, its easy to prepare..just add water, and its very tasty..."
Marianne,"I love Salsa and have tried many on the market. I served Dippin Fiesta at a recent Sunday football get together and got rave reviews. Maybe the best Salsa I have ever tasted and served. If you want to taste the best, try this one."
Perfect gift,"Gave this to two people as gifts for Christmas. I was amazed how large the bottles were and they were too. One person told me this is the Chef that trained Emiel, you know the BAM guy on the food network--who knew. The other person is just really into marinades. Have to really say this its a great price for how much you get. AWESOME...never did get a call to come over for dinner lol"
6 Star Dog Food,"After trying the 6 lb bag of Go Grain Free Endurance, and watching my Border Collie's skin allergy problem begin to disappear, this had to be one of the reasons its gone now. All I can say is this dog food is the best. I will never go back to standard-cheap-filled with whatever-dog food as I think my dog is worth the extra natural goodness in Go. End of story..."
Really terrible! Try another flavor. Don't waste your money!,"I am a big fan of Primal Strips. In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The ""lime"" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer."
An Excellent Food,"Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference!"
Flavor-Lessly Light Coffee,"ok-i've tried & liked many Green Mountain coffees, but this isn't one of them.  It should be labeled ""VERY light"" (aka...extremely(!) weak).  Even using the small water size cup, we found it bland.<br />won't be a repeat customer of this one.<br />Note:  for some reason, these boxes had no expiration date printed on them, whereas, all previous orders have.(?)"
Great treat just like all Zuke products,"My dog loves these, will do anything for them. They are a great training treat also and are easy to break in half. I also use the Zuke mini treats which also are awsome treats. I have repurchased these multiple times because they are so awsome. I also love that Zuke's uses quality natual ingredients. Nothing bad to say about these treats."
Good strong coffee,One of the better k-cup coffee out there.  Most k-cup coffee I've tried are pretty weak but this one is definitely a keeper.
awesome taste,this product was hard to find.  I was thrilled to find it at Amazon.  If you like figs and dark chocolate (not a candy coating) - this is the bar for  you!
excellent cookies!,"I purchased these cookies blind, I had not tasted this brand. They were a little crumbly, but not enough to affect the taste. I thought they were wonderful, with only a few broken ones in my delivered box. I would order these again."
Sumatra coffee,"We like this coffee, but can't get locally any more.  It is cheaper to order than it was to buy at local store when it was available."
Clogs brewer,"While the taste of this coffee is good, for some reason, it tends to clog in the brewing process.  I've used it in 3 different brewers with the same problem.  To prevent this problem, the K-cup has to be shaken immediately prior to brewing.  Perhaps the coffee is ground too fine and is getting packed down as the water is being pressed through the K-cup.  I probably wouldn't buy this brand again."
"Big bag, Great Taste","The same great taste! I looked for Life Savers in several stores.<br />Apparently Live Savers do not sell well enough for stores to stock them anymore. But, Good ole Amazon came through with all the flavors and excellent pricing."
Superb!,"This matcha green tea is perfect for the price and the quantity! As both a baker and a green tea lover, it will be utilized immensely! This is a fabulous product!"
Tasty and light,"Pop Chips are delicious, light and tasty. I bought a box of the Parmesan Garlic and it almost dissapeared before I had a chance to eat some of them."
Good salt,Love this salt. Was very hard to find in stores and Amazon made it easy. This is not your ordinary table salt...and may have some health benefit!
Pepto Please,this product is like a laxative.  It made me go twice after the first bite
K-Cup Carousel,"This is a sturdy, handy little gadget.  Love the color.  Holds 18 cups- plenty of choices.  We keep it right by the machine.  Love it!"
Great Gluten Free Cakemix,"After trying a few Gluten Free cake mix products and not being very satisfied with the results, I was extremely excited to finally find a product that makes a wonderful cake that has great texture and taste.  I have taken cakes to parties and everyone is enjoying the dessert without even knowing it is Gluten Free."
Sort of have moldy after taste,"I've only bought one roll of these at the store. The first taste is OK, but there is a really weird aftertaste that I can only describe as tasting ""moldy""? Bought the wintergreen version as well and they definitely do NOT have the odd aftertaste."
"Small bars of chocolate, but easy on the conscience","I wish they had shipped me the correct box of chocolate... instead, I ended up with the cherry dark chocolate.  Still good, but not what I ordered.  The bars are very small, compared to a typical bar of chocolate, but I suppose that's what happens when you ask for the switch to organic."
PASS THE PASTA,"THIS IS A GREAT PASTA. GOOD FOR USUAL SERVING, LIKE VARIOUS SAUCES, BUT MAKES EXCELLENT PASTA SALADS AND IS DELICIOUS IN HOME MADE SOUP"
Very Good,"These are very good - not as good as the gluten counterpart, but nonetheless, good.  I like to keep these on hand so when we feel like having pizza at the last minute, I don't have to spend a couple of hours preparing the crust.  Good job!"
Excellent product,I know it's a good product but would like to know how to use it there are no instructions how much or what to use it in.
5 Star rating for CytoSport - Cytomax - 4.5lbs - Go Grape,Great value - great taste for sports drink-fare.  This is the only drink I use these days on the trails.  Very easy on the system!  No bad after taste. The 4.5 lbs cans are an awesome value.
Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips,"Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around."
great product over priced shipping,"The product was excellent but, the shipping was extremely over priced.<br />Would find a better way to order the product in the future."
Just the right amount of cinnamon,"I like this tea a lot, especially for the first cup of the day.  Mild, yet distinct cinnamon flavor that is not overpowering like some cinnamon teas.  And healthy green tea is a plus."
Watch Out Whole Foods,"The chips are great, with a family of seven the only shelf life I worry about is keeping them there.  Really though, did you see the price?  Like $1.12 a bag. Whole foods may finnally have someone to hold them accountable destroying health food stores.  Thanks Amazon, for carring the brands whole foods wont bother with any more and for having prices that you can feed families with."
So good!,We love this hazelnut coffee. It is very finely ground and has a great flavor. We use it in a coffee maker that uses a permanent filter as opposed to disposable filters.
Love these,"I wasn't sure if these would be fresh, they are perfect. I recommend them and they're one of my favorite candies."
TO White Tea,"Delicious, light, organic white tea. Flavor is consistent time after time. I use an automatic tea maker with two tea bags for this on the strong flavor setting for best results. The tea is never bitter, and I drink it unsweetened. The price per case through subscribe and save is very economical. I highly recommend this tea for its great antioxidant properties."
"Good value, not oily, crisp, fresh, but dominated by the potato variety","Overall one of the better veggie stix I have tried. I liked that they have much less of an oil taste than other brands I have tried; very fresh tasting. Also better than store bought price especially if you use subscribe and save.<br /><br />I got these in late December and they had around a 3 month expiration date. The have the standard potato, tomato, and spinach flavors. And like most brands I have bought in store they are not evenly placed in the bag, the potato flavor dominates. But not more than other brands, and these taste better and better priced at Amazon. Recommended."
REEEEAAAALYYYY YUMMY!,"This apple cider is sooooo yummy!  I was a little skeptical because even the good coffee K-Cups are not that great, but the cider is really great.  If you add some ground cinnamon it almost tastes homemade."
smells like turpentine,"I did not open right away, I had ordered another kind of cereal and started that kind first.  Therefore was not able to return, as I missed the deadline by a couple of days. The cereal smells like turpentine. Will not be ordering this again.  After a while smell comes through and even the box starts to smell like this.  I have asked others about it just to make sure it was as I had perceived it.  No one else had a different opinion.  They too say it stinks.<br />I will feed the grandkids the sugar-laden cereals before this ""healthy"" one."
My daughter and I both loved it and we enjoy vastly different drinks,"This drink is a bit tart, reflecting the natural flavors of white grape, apple and lemon juices. With 70% of the contents pure juice concentrates, a small can contains the equivalent of a lot of fruit juice. The drink contains no caffeine and most of the balance of the liquid is sparkling water. There are also no refined sugars or preservatives in the mixture.<br /> I found it very refreshing and in general I do not like tart drinks. The tartness is light; the sparkling water largely offsets it, giving it just enough fizz to give you a carbonation buzz. My daughter also enjoyed it; her favorite pop is sugared root beer, while mine is Diet Coke. If this drink can satisfy tastes on both ends of that spectrum, then most people will find it within their happy taste zone."
Good blend,"This is a good all around blend that falls near the middle of the light to dark roast spectrum. This is the roast they use as a base for their coffee coolers. My personal favorite is Caribou's Obsidian blend, however.<br /><br />Note: If you're going to buy it, for Heaven's sake, just get it directly from Caribou. This price of $19.99 for 12 ounces is ridiculous! Caribou sells it online and in their stores for $10.99/lb. They often have free shipping sales, too. And on Mondays at their stores, you can get a pound of it for only $8.99. Don't get ripped off!"
Adds a touch of class to ice cream,This product adds a touch of real flavor to normally bland ice cream. The flavors make a real fruit<br />flavor come alive and add excitement to any dish.
I love this stuff!,"OK, let me start out by saying that chocolate is always in my house and office. I always have milk chocolate and dark chocolate, sometimes white chocolate. I bought this because I have tried a bunch of the Lindt flavors and sent them to my pen pal overseas. Yes, people in this day and age still have pen pals! I was explaining in one of my letters that our grocery store has a span of 5 to 6 Lindt bars in various flavors at all times. She asked me what I was talking about because chocolate comes in milk and dark where she lives. So... I bought up what my grocery store had then sent it off to Northern Europe. My pen pal's family loved trying the various flavors.<br /><br />So... when my local grocery store ran out of ""new"" flavors to send I came to Amazon for help. I put this in my cart, along with every other unusual chocolate flavor I could find (from Lindt and others). When each box of 12 arrived I shared a few bars with the office staff and sent a few bars to my pen pal. This box of chocolate bars DISAPPEARED right before my eyes! I think I sent 3 bars to Europe and the remaining bars were devoured at work. Any buyer of chocolate for an office crew KNOWS when the chocolate is way above par because the pleading eyes come from every corner of the building to grovel for more chocolate.<br /><br />I would buy this again, and again, and again. The box has 12 bars so it should last a few days depending on how many mouths there are to feed. I would certainly stock up in April or May for the warmer summer months (unless you live in the extreme south of the USA, then I would order in the coolest months and stock pile for all the rest of the year).<br /><br />This is a smooth, creamy chocolate. The aroma is fantastic and certainly reminiscent of chocolate. It has a subtle creamy, milk flavor without feeling or tasting burned. The bar is sufficiently sweet without being cloying. The vanilla aroma is pure and delicate but noticeable. If anyone likes white chocolate I think they will LOVE this particular white chocolate."
Popchips BBQ Potato Chips,"By accident, I stumbled on this product a few months ago.  Absolutely love the Popchips BBQ Potato Chips.  I've tried ALL the flavors, but BBQ is my favorite.  I'm on Weight Watchers, and this is a great alternative to regular chips...and I don't feel one bit guilty after eating a bag!  I get the individual sized bags by the case...so they're always available.  Can't find them locally, but Amazon.com is the next best thing!"
Amazing taste!,"I purchased these chips because I love sweet potato chips in general, but these far surpass the taste of your ordinary sweet potato chip. These are crisp and crunchy and not as sweet as the standard variety. That they are kosher, trans fat free, and gluten free are an added bonus. The 1.5 oz. bags are perfect for an afternoon snack, and only around 200 calories. I love them so much I now have Amazon ship a case every month."
Love this tea!,"I drink tea everyday and this is by far my favorite. I see some negative reviews and they just go to show you that everyone has different tastes. I REALLY like this tea and, so far, everyone I have let try it has liked it too."
My cats beg for this,My cats love this because it has a lot of sauce. They like the regular Whiskas tender bites wet food also but end up licking off the sauce and leaving most of the food behind. This is their new favorite food.
Just one cup of coffee,"I received a single cup coffee maker for Christmas.then I went to buy the pods and found that the store was limited in thier choices.Then I found them on amazon,and at a  good price. Makes a good cup of coffee."
My dogs love it :),"One of my little dogs was starting to get bad breath.  After about one month on Wellness, the bad breath is gone!  I guess the previous diet I had them on had a lot of non-digestible ingredients.  Whatever the reason, I'm happy :)"
Spaghetti Order Review !,I ordered a Package case of 6 items BUT some how the order was changed and only 1 item  was shipped and was received on the promised day ! In addition I have been charged $ 6.99 for the one item which is too much ! I'd still like to CASE at ? when aviable !<br /><br />Galen Jim) Miller
"Compact, effective, EASY","This sprouter is awesome. Its small and inconspicuous, works very effectively and is extremely easy to use. I tend to forget about my sprouts on day two, so far i have only sprouted various beans and wheat berries, some cashews and sunflower seeds. I have tried quinoa, and the quinoa is so small it just got stuck in the holes of the sprouter. Other than that, this is an awesome little system. I have sprouted in jars and this is more convenient. I like that I can add onto it when I get more adventurous with my sprouting, and that this is still small enough to take camping."
Clear Men Scalp Therapy does it again!,"After using H&S for many years I thought it was high time to try something else and see if I couldn't improve my current shampoo situation. Clear Men Scalp Therapy sounded interesting so I figured ""what the heck"" ! You get almost 11 ounces in this bottle which is a bit less than my current brand.<br /><br />The bottle is easy to grasp and manage in the shower without becoming slippery from the water and opening is a breeze thanks to the push down lid. I found that while the consistency of this shampoo seemed a bit thin to me, very little was actually needed to achieve a full head of suds and to clean my overly oily hair and scalp.<br /><br />After using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for 45 days I can happily report at least the same dandruff reducing results as I got my my mainstay Head and Shoulders. But since the shampoo is apparently more concentrated, I used less and it actually rinsed out faster.<br /><br />I wanted to try the Clean & Refresh variety and it feels both great to use and leaves a nice subtle scent. As with all my other Clear shampoo products this will leave your hair thoroughly cleaned but not oily feeling. Plenty of lather and an easy rinse off are what I have found to be the case with all the Clear shampoos I have tried so far.  (I have tried AND used 3 varieties) They all smell good and not overpowering and they ALL get my hair very clean.<br /><br />Basically all the varieties of Clear I have used employ a varying special formulation that includes tea tree among other ingredients. Some with conditioner, some without. Now I am no expert but honestly my hair is much more manageable after a weeks use of Clear brand shampoo as opposed to H&S and the anti dandruff ingredients do the trick 100%!  Give it a try! I like it, maybe you will too."
2 servings GONE! :-),"My 5 month old LOVES these mixtures. I promised I would never feed him something that I wouldn't eat myself. They ALL taste good. I would eat any of them if I was so inclined to eat a pureed meal. They are easy to pack & throw in the diaper back/suit case for travel. I had no worry about them leaking (like a small plastic tupperware).  The price is right, shipping was quick, and they store really well in the pantry in the ready made box."
yum?,"I can't really say that the food is yum, because I'm a vegetarian and won't eat it!  However, all three cats go exuberantly wild whenever I serve it to them, and, like a good mommy, I'm happy that it is so healthy.<br /><br />On a more superficial note, due to my visceral dislike of touching meat, I'm pleased with the fact that the chicken/turkey and turkey/chicken (what??) slide very easily out of the can.<br /><br />The doggie likes the dog variety even better."
Powerful punch,"Wow, these chips bite back. I loves me some salt and pepper potato chips, but these have little bit too much spice for my liking. Also, the portion is a little too much. If you like spice, then dive in."
GOOD COFFEE,Great Coffee!<br /><br />Extra Bold Hazelnut is my favorite.  The others I have to make using the smallest cup size because to me they are watered down if you try to make a full cup.
Buyer beware,"I ordered this item, and was instead shipped a different item (ginger beer).  There is a difference, and the company that makes this makes both.  However, Amazon's warehouses are too stupid to recognize the difference.  When I politely pointed out to them that they had shipped me the wrong item, they very politely apologized, and promised to send me the right item...whereupon they sent me exactly the same wrong item again.  When I complained again, and asked them to either find the right item, or refund my money, they ignored me.  If you really want ginger ale, you can buy this mix on the Internet from other suppliers.  Don't say I didn't warn you."
Lunchables for Grown-Ups,"I first stumbled across the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBNKC2"">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Turkey Stick + Crunch, 3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> at an overpriced airport store.  I dutifully shelled out six bucks for this rescue from a delayed flight; I loved it.  Since then, I have been sampling each flavor that interests me.<br /><br />This box is the front runner so far.  As much as I loved the turkey stick box, this one feels more like a meal.  Maybe it's the process of stacking a cracker and pepperoni slice with a smear of cheese. Sure, the pepperoni is greasy, buy hey!  It's pepperoni.  At under 300 calories, you would be hard pressed to find a treat this satisfying to compare. I definitely like this better than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBNJQ4"">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Steak Nuggets + Cheese, 3.-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  I just placed my next GoPicnic order; I'm looking forward to the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBP6Q0"">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Hummus + Crackers, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>."
Success!,"I bought my mother this gift basket for Mother's Day and she loved it!  The Vidalia Hot Sauce, especially, is a hit in our house."
Works per advertised,Right amount of caffeine to wake you up.  Flavor and strength are fine too.  I will buy these again as soon as I run out.
"Effervescent, bubbly & tastes like vitamins","Bubbly, effervescent drink mix. Pour SLOWLY into water! Will overflow. Like pouring pop-rocks into water. Tastes a lot like vitamins that are in these.<br /><br />They are OK. Some of  the flavor comes through, but mostly tastes like vitamins masked by flavors - not a great meld.<br /><br />If you need vitamins, take the separately, unless you like the tastes of vitamins. Acidic, punchy taste. Doesn't set well with an upset stomach.<br /><br />Not my favorite tastes, but OK. A lot like Tang with a punchy, vitamin flavor."
Weak brew,No instructions on packaging that I could find. So first I put a pod into K cup machine. This is NOT for K cup machines. No taste. I do brew tea bags in same machine with great results.<br /><br />Then I put a pod in a cup and covered it with hot water and let steep quite a while.  Weak. Not my cup of coffee.
Good enough,This is the first food item i have ever ordered online so i wasn't expecting much. I'm over seas so i think the taste of the muffins was a little odd at first due to the distance factor. Over all they are still the muffins i love at a resonable price so they are good enough for me.
Too Weak For My Taste,"I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though."
jerky,"pieces are small, not like a regular piece of jerky.  It had a good flavor though.  After purchasing them here, found them a lot cheaper at local warehouse store."
kind bars,"The only problem with this bar is that once you try it you can't seem to do without it, it tastes that good.<br />Dr. OZ mentioned these bars on his show so we thought we would try one, WOW! we love them.<br />This particular one, (KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew) if you read the ingredients you will find not one thing that is bad for you. Finally a treat that won't harm you......unless you eat about six a day...(calories)<br />We checked quite a few places that handle this product and Amazon is by far the best price."
5-Star Gourmet Breakfast,"Since I tried Bob's Red Mill Creamy Buckwheat Cereal it's become my favorite day starter, like this:  timed at 4:30 min. @ 70% microwave, then a further 1 min, 40 sec. to thaw added 1 cup frozen blueberries.  Top with a hefty dollop of vanilla ice cream (instead of milk). This is pure breakfast joy!  Pour a cup of coffee, line up your vitamins, and have a great day.<br />Lorraine Keesh"
Eggcellent Product!,"This egg protein is great!<br />First off, it is sweetened with Stevia, a natural herb, and not some artificial sweetener like aspartame or sucralose.<br />Next, it is very easy on the stomach, even whey without lactose is a lot harder on my digestion system it seems.<br />It tastes good, mixes well, and is a good value.<br />I bought all 3 flavors and found I prefer the vanilla.<br />Goes really well with some almond milk and blueberries.<br />I'm glad I've found a pure protein source that is dairy and soy free."
Excellent product. Excellent service from company.,"I've used this product for years, but I have difficulty finding it where I live. Amazon had the product shipped to my door overnight, and didn't charge me for shipping. The 56-oz. size will last a long time, but when I need it again, I'll know where to get it. I use toasted sesame oil in my salad dressing. It provides a tasty spin in traditional oil and vinegar dressings."
so many uses...,"i was totally satisfied with the product.  i too use the oil for the skin as well as for cooking.  it's great at high temperatures, good to drizzle on salads, and yes it is more mild but if you want the stronger flavour  you should try their toasted sesame oil."
"Love, Love, LOVE this oatmeal","Love, Love, LOVE this oatmeal.  Really.<br />Filling and nutritious.  Has been great for my blood sugars too!  Am actually looking forward to my next cholesterol test to see what, if any, impact it has had.  I understand that there is a quicker version, but I have been hesitant to switch because I like this one so much."
Great for hot cocoa,Not much beyond the review title to say...this stuff makes great hot cocoa.  It tastes decidedly more decadent than a pure fat-free cocoa powder should... But I'll take it!
Really good!,"I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more juicy. I look forward to trying the other varieties.<br />I just tried the Texas Bar-b-que, and I really like this flavor as well. This version seems to be a bit less ""saucy"", but just as moist and delicious. It does have a ""stringy"" texture to it that makes dental floss a must! In the search for a good veggie jerky, I am leaning towards the Primal line."
Surprizing lil' chocolate shots.,"I recieved my Athon Berg chocolates today, 12-9-10. They were here earlier then expected, and in perfect condition. No leaks or any crushed. I took them to share at a Christmas party. Everyone loved them! I hide a whole bunch! I loved the Grande Marinier and the Southern Comfort the most. I love the burn and kick these little confections give. They are awesome! I WILL be buying them again as well as recommending them to my friends and family. Thank you to the thenewmall as well as Amazon. Meep meep"
Great alternative to the same flavors over and over again,"This assortment is a great alternative to the same flavors over and over again. I do find that they arent as filling as others but I think that has to do with the ""cream"" aspect. I gave all the peaches away as I don't like peach but everything else is delicious. I was also pleased to see that there are not many  more calories in these as the regular flavors"
Taste like paste,"Granted, I tried to doctor this mix up based upon some other reviews and my own baking experience pre-gluten-free, but I imagine if these muffins tasted as bad as they did doctored up, this is a pretty sorry mix.  It is possible that I just got a bad bag, but the expiration date was still 11 months away so no excuse.  I added orange juice and yogurt in place of water for moisture, and added 1/3C brown sugar as a sweetener.  I threw in a large dash of flax seed meal (which I add to everything I bake GF for fiber and protein).  I added butter (whirred with the brown sugar to start) in place of oil, and 1C frozen blueberries since the goal was blueberry muffins.  They were awful enough, literally like paste, that I had to spit out what I ate and so did my husband.  But the kids had fun making them and actually like them.  Good thing I made banana bread muffins from scratch the same day or I would have been really disappointed."
Dream in a Cup,"I've just finished my first cup of Green Tea Tropical in Pouch......and brewed a second cup with the same pouch, and I'm IN LOVE!!!!  This is the SMOOTHEST flavored green tea I've ever tasted, and it is delicious!  I was afraid to try it because it's a tad pricier than most tea bag teas, but it is well worth the price, especially since you can steep it twice!  The leaves unfurled and swelled in the pouch and created an aroma that had my students commenting on it!  I cannot wait to sample more teas from this company!!! Well done, MIGHTY LEAF!!!"
Great on baked potatoes too!,"On my Presto Powerpop corn this is one of my favorites.  I dump into a large bowl, spray a little oil, season, and then a second light spray of oil to lock in place.  Remove the top half or so of popcorn to a second bowl and repeat the seasoning process.  With a Misto or small perfume type sprayer, I can get down to as little as one teaspoon of oil and 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning per 2 quart batch of popcorn.<br /><br />It also works great on baked potatoes.  My rankings:<br /><br />1. Parmesan/garlic<br />2. Tie for sour cream and onion with ranch<br />4. Tie for nacho cheese and white cheddar<br />6. Butter<br />7. Barbeque - still good, but grind is coarser, lack of salt requires double the amount of seasoning."
One of the best flavored K-cups I've tried,"Often with coffee in general, and especially k-cups in my experience, flavors don't work too well. I was ordering a book and needing to get to over $25 for free shipping when I spotted these in my Quick Picks section and went ahead and added them to my order. One of my favorite coffees from when I was a college student was a pump of raspberry syrup into my coffee. This is surprisingly very similar and very good. It's now the third Van Houtte k-cup I've tried and I've been pleased with every choice, but most pleased with this one. I added a packet of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ"">Stevia Supreme-50pkts - 1.8 oz - Packet</a> and some half and half and it's a wonderful dessert coffee.<br /><br />I feel this is a much better option than those sugar laden artificially flavored non-dairy coffee creamers. My top two flavored k-cups are now <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WRHQRA"">Green Mountain 15535 Pumpkin Spice K-Cups, Light, 18 pods</a> and this one.<br /><br />I hope this winter that they come out with a peppermint k-cup!"
Love This Rice!,"I first found this rice in a local grocery store... then they stopped stocking it, and I could no longer find it at any local grocery chain. I was so disappointed as I love the tiny bit spicy coconut/ginger taste. This rice goes especially well as a side dish to 'bland' meats such as baked chicken. So yummy and easy to make. Good old Amazon...I get six boxes at one time and simply reorder as needed. Try it..you'll love it too!"
Love This Stuff!,"Absolutely delicious! The 4-ounce size is great, although there is kind of a lot of packaging. I like to enjoy some with a nice cold beer."
Fantastic quality,"I buy vanilla beans to make homemade vanilla instead of store bought extract. I decided to order some because my local grocer didn't carry them anymore and the only other place in town wanted a mint for a few beans that looked more like dried sticks. Amazon here i come!<br />The beans were large and full, not whimpy little string bean looking beans i buy normally. And the taste...wonderful!<br />And the best part is the price! i had enough beans to make vanilla for a few friends, and now there are Homemade Vanilla converts as well."
"Good robust flavor, lots of jitters!","I enjoy a rich, robust cup of coffee, this coffee fits the ticket if you like the same.  AFter reading the reviews, I decdied to try it.  It seemed to be priced well in comparison to other Italian Roasts out there. I will say though that it must be packed full of caffene.  I can only drink one cup of this stuff, it gets me pretty wound up."
deer grilln,we grilled deermeat with this marinade at a tailgating party at a reasent football game and everyone loved it i injected it andit was the best thing we grilled allday everyone there asks about the marinade its good but hard to find in the stores
Ingredients list wrong,"I bought this because the ingredients listed on Amazon say all natural ingredients. When I received this and read the package, the third ingredient is ""artificial flavor"". I contacted the company and they said if you want all natural ingredients you need to order the 24 bag boxes."
Angelo Pietro Sesame Miso dressing,"My daughter in law was able to purchase this wonderful dressing at a market in Atlanta.  When that market closed, she was not able to find it no matter where she looked.  She was able to order from the manufacturer by the case (6 units) on line.  When I sampled the dressing, I loved it as much as she did. I was unable to find it in my home town of Macon, Georgia, however and was relegated to order a case unit on line. I too ordered on line from the manufacturer. I had no problems with my order, and I would rate the service excellent.  I really wish the dressing was more readily available in the local market in quantities more customer friendly."
i LOVE this almond milk,"i LOVE this almond milk and hope it hasn't been discontinued due to the american public's love of all things junky. it's the only honest product out there, with no added sugar and no added fillers like sunflower oil, etc.  i have been to a couple of stores these past two weeks and have been unable to find it any longer.  there isn't a single almond milk out there that meets my expectations... so if they stop making this one, i will have to start making my own, phooey!"
FAVORITE COFFEE,THIS gEVALIA ONE OF MY FAVORITES COFFEE. GOOD FLAVOR AND AROMA AND GOOD PRICE. HOPE THAT IT HAD MORE AROMA BUT STILL GREAT.
We love these bars!,"We love these granola bars!  Our family goes through a box a day, so we were excited to see them on the subscribe and save program!  They are organic, so we feel good about letting our kids consume them."
Best veg jerky,"I think its interesting how spread out the reviews are on this product.  I guess its one of those love it or hate it type things.  Personally, I LOVE this jerky and cannot get enough!!  My favorite flavors are the hot pastrami and teriyaki. You do have to chew quite a bit but its not the same weird chewy texture some other veg jerkys have, like primal strips.  I hate primal strips but I had them about 10 years ago and never ate once since, so if the formula has changes on those then disregard...  So maybe try a small bag of this before ordering in bulk."
Don't let the GMO Haters Scare You Off!!!,"Let's get this out of the way first: THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH GMO CORN OIL! Several un-informed reviewers on here feel it is their duty to bad mouth this ingredient and thus the overall product.  GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism.  In other words, food that has had its DNA altered.  The reasons for such alterations are for better, disease and insect resistant crops.  Wow, really a BAD thing huh?  After over 15 years of GMO products being in wide use, the statistics show that not only are these products NOT bad for you, in many instances they are BETTER for you! But some people cannot wrap their head around the fact that humanity has improved upon nature.<br /><br />Now about these pea snacks.  Awesome!  Tastier and much better for you than a tube of Pringles."
Stash Tea Bags,"I was disappointed and suprised that the 100 count tea bags were sent loose in an unmarked box. Also, the tea, when brewed, does not seem to be as strong as when I have purchased the same blend from traditional grocery stores. I question the freshness and authenticity of the product. I will not buy this product again in this manner."
Great Product,Great product quick delivery and just as it is shown on the picture. really happy with the product.
Yum-o!,I really liked these cherries.  They are sweet-- but not too sweet.  Great by themselves and awesome when added to my breakfast oatmeal.  A real hit!
absolutely delicious,"i love apple cider, but this was genious to put the caramel with it.  it melts in your mouth & is a warm comforting beverage.  love it!"
Can't Decide,"I was looking to lose a few extra pounds but I LOVE pasta. So I bought this and some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TOB8QW"">Walden Farms Calorie Free Pasta Sauce Alfredo -- 12 fl oz</a>. I lost the weight but I was able to notice a texture difference with these. I know for some people that is a big deal. I just manned up and dealt with it. Having said that, I stink at making noodles and can never get them right. I have friends that make them and they turn out lots better. So would I recommend them, definitely. Who wouldn't love the no calorie deal and if you team it up with the walden calorie free stuff your meal is basically calorie free. Its a great way to cut your calories down for one meal a day. Dont drop your calories too low though. Thats not a healthy thing to do."
GREAT DOG FOOD,I have to buy this dog food for my Dashound because of allergies to food. This is the only dry dog food I have been able to find that will not cause him to break out with bumps. Beside he loves it. I will continue to buy this as long as I can find it.<br /><br />He has had no adverse reactions since being on the this food. It is better than the stuff the vet was selling me for allergy's.
Great product but poor advertising on Amazon's part,"Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!"
COSTS TOO MUCH!,Just purchased this at Safeway for $15.99 per 8.8 oz. can which of course is $31.98 for the two that Amazon is offering here for more than $35.00(too expensive) however for ready ground coffee it is AMAZING.  It actually smells and tastes as if one had just put it through the grinder seconds before it went into the machine.
Incredible Chocolate tea!  Hershey's anyone?,"I tell everyone I know to buy this tea.  It's the ONLY chocolate tea I've found that actually tastes like chocolate!  It's not overwhelming and although I'm not normally a fan of hazelnut, it really only serves to act as a flavor enhancer to the chocolate.  It's just awesome, hands down, not weak either, although it is decaf.  The price here is a bit high - you can get this in the store that begins and ends with a t here in the States for about two dollars and a quarter for the 18 bag size.  Great, incredible stuff, I'm almost out again!  Highly, highly recommend!"
Tasty Carbonated Orange Juice,"If you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product.  Tasty and refreshing.  However, like all juice it is not low in calories, so don't buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored sport drink."
hard to find,"I needed fenugreek seeds to make my own curry powder...but couldn't find it locally. As always, Amazon helped me out.  The details also indicated that these seeds can be eaten or planted, so I'll be planting a few in a few weeks to see what happens."
Healing Oolong Tea,"I have occasional bouts of eczema like rashes that take months to go away.  When I drink this tea, the rash does gradually go away.<br />Bigelow seems to be the best Oolong in bag tea.  There are stronger kinds in loose tea but they are inconvenient."
Like crack,"These things are like crack, I can't stop eating them!! Hence why I buy them in 12 packs :)"
Good -,"I liked the single-serving bowls, but understand this is more 'green' because it requires less packaging. My only complaint is if you don't eat it quickly enough it gets rubber-y. But I LOVE that it has the fiber in it for so few calories!!"
The Best Gummi Bears!,I've loved these since I was a kid.  These are the best Gummi Bears I have ever had.  You can't compare the taste and texture to any other gummi bear out there.
My cats like them,"I have two big cats (over 15 lbs each) and they eat mostly canned food.  I don't feed them dry food except as a treat.  Both cats come running when I shake the can.  They eat them up and beg for more.  OK, the packaging is excessive to say the least.  They come in a paint can when a plastic zip bag would easily suffice.  I'm taking a star away for the paint can which is only about 1/3 full when you put in the treats."
Amazing tea!!,"I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?"
Delicious,"I made these brownies with Light Yoplait Vanilla Yogurt and they were amazing!  They were so moist and delicious.  I have recommended them to everyone I know!  They do stick to the pan a little more than average brownies, but I'll take that over super fatty brownies any day.  When you first start mixing these it may seem like there isn't enough yogurt in them to smooth out, but with a lot of stirring they'll end up mixing wonderfully.  I love these brownies and recommend them to anyone!"
"Good product, great quality","Why I would give it five stars: Quick shipment of a quality, fresh, consistent product.  I have never been disappointed when ordering from Haribo through Amazon.<br /><br />Why 4 stars instead?  The one star less is completely due to the taste of the Techno Bears as per personal taste preferences.  I brought the product to the office as a change of pace from the usual gummy bears.  Most people preferred the traditional bears to these as they are generally larger, chewier, and with stranger tastes.  These different tastes did not agree with most people, although I found them to be a nice change (though certainly not better)."
gross,Tasted horrible . It made me want to puke. Totally riuned my salad. What a waste.I cant believe I wasted my money on this and none of my friends that tried it liked it either.
Too Much Sugar!,"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack."
Happy with this Nylabone,"My GSD is happy with her new Nylabone chew bone.  She had the smooth one last time and seems to like this one even more, great for keeping those teeth clean."
The Very Best,"I have been using Alber's Yellow Corn Meal for about 40 years.  I have their recipe for cornbread memorized as it is the best, most pure cornbread I have ever eaten. After moving to the south and not being able to find it I began going through a withdrawal.  I tried all different kinds of ""corn meal"", which, being in the south usually meant more of a ""corn FLOUR""!  I was eating cakie, heavy cornbread and couldn't stand it.  It was in desperation that I checked Amazon and found that I could order my very favorite!  Now I have to admit that 4-40 oz boxes is a bit much for 2 old people but I put 2 boxes in the freezer and gave one to my daughter who declared that it made the best cornbread she had ever had also.  (She had forgotten the cornbread of her youth!)  So, if you are looking for the best, most pure and authentic cornbread ever, stop messing around the cheap copies and get the real thing - Albers!"
Excellent cinnamon!,Now THIS is real cinnamon! Wonderful flavor - just absolutely makes all other cinnamon pale in comparison - I have never had such strong flavored real cinnamon before this- If you use it - do yourself a favor & try some of this brand - You will use only 1/8th as much to even get close to previous flavors of cinnamon...
Seeds are good... shipping too much.,"Seeds are nice and tasty... However, shipping almost doubles the price.  Found a local organic seller of seeds and the price is much better."
My favorite shaved ice syrup.,"I love snowcones. Year 'round. Even more than ice cream, if that's possible. Hawaiian Shaved Ice is my favorite brand of snowcone syrup. That's why I'm a repeat customer with them. They have a great selection of flavors. I have my favorites, of course, but I haven't found a bad one in the bunch. The classics are all here, along with some fun wacky flavors, as well. The concentration of the syrup and the nuances of flavoring are just right. I use a little snowcone machine that gets the ice to the proper consistency, put it in an ice ice cream cup, and then with the Hawaiian brand syrup it's as good as they have at the amusement park. If I have any little complaint, it's merely that the last bottle I ordered didn't have the little smiley face sun character on the label anymore. I say ""bring him back!"""
More sweet than Pomegranate,"Most of Newman's Own products are delicious. I've been a fan of his pasta sauce for several years, so I was happy to try their Licorice Twists. I typically prefer black Licorice and expect licorice to have at least some licorice flavor, if not a texture that is somewhere between chewy and hard. I found the texture of the Newman's Own Licorice to be overly soft, but find the flavor to be overpoweringly sweet. So much so that the pomegranate flavor is nearly undetectable."
One of the best,"This one of the best mixes I've had, it was best to me when I used only water, no egg or oil. A dap of natural peanut butter on top and warm maple syrup is hard to beat. Don't be affraid of omitting the egg or oil, you can add a spoonfull of yogurt when mixing if you like moister pancakes."
Nuts Over These Nuts,"I can't say enough about these nuts, they are fantastic!  I stopped buying them years ago because they were way too expensive but at Amazon's price I'm now a subscription customer.  The only problem with these nuts is that once you open the can you don't want to stop eating them.  They have a Kona Coffee glaze and have just a hint of coffee flavor. I highly recommend this product."
Wonderful product!!,"This salt is so pink and taste like the ocean, I love it. Make sure to buy a grinder of some sort if you plan to use it on salads or sprinkle on cold dishes."
Love it!,"I can't get this product at any local super market or WallyWorld store. I use it for Tacos, burrito,homemade chili, chimichungas. It has all the seasonings but with none of the red stuff like other mixs."
"smells less, tracks more",This seems to reduce the smell but does track out of box A LOT. Rather than tiny sand like pieces in your house theres big pebbles of this stuff.<br />If this was a much smaller size that didnt track as much it would be great!
tasty!,I USED TO PURCHASE THESE AT MY LOCAL WAL-MART BUT THEY DO NOT CARRY THEM ANYMORE AND WHEN I LOOKED AT OTHER STORES THEY WERE SOOOO EXPENSIVE.<br />I DECIDED TO CHECK ONLINE AND WAS ABLE TO ORDER THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND RECEIVED THEM PRETTY QUICK.<br />NOW I AM A HAPPY AND CONTENT CUSTOMER
Great taste!,The best coconut water...it is much better in the bottle than the paper box. I would recommend it. It even tastes great at room temperature.
Old Horseradish,"I was excited to eat the Atomic Horseradish I had tryed at a Beverly Hills steakhouse.  I opened a couple jars last night for a 10lb Prime Rib.  No burn, no sinus clearing, very bland.  I dont know how long it has to sit to lose its heat, but this was awful.  It has been in my fridge in prep for the holidays. It isnt expired, best by 2/29/2012 M1174. Very Disappointed."
Excellent Product,Terra Exotic Vegetable Chips are the very best chips on the market. They have a good taste and are not greasy like so many similar products.
My Lab just ate the whole thing!,"OMG, I gave this to my 1 year old, 110 lab and he ran outside with it. I got distracted and when I went to check he had already eaten the entire thing. The only thing I could find were two horrible splinter pieces!! Now I'm at this moment terrified!!! I read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these...I'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay. It's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch. I've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway. Plus he had already eaten his dinner so I'm hoping his ""full"" tummy will help the bone to pass. Needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before I handed it out. But we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and I'm not thinking clearly as it is. I soooo wish I could turn back time and have never given it to him!! Please stay away from this bone and please, if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while I wait, I'm open to them as I am worried sick!!! I've already lost my 14 year old lab in Sept and this one we got in Oct and he his my Angel!!! I would die if anything happened to him!!!"
Soup,"My girlfriend started to heat up a pack of this stuff and the whole house smelled like cock in no time!  All kidding aside, the product has a salty taste, but lots of flavor."
Best of the Quaker Instants....,"I have this low-sugar oatmeal several times a week.  It's got good fiber without being pastey -- and best of all, it's not so cloyingly sweet as the other instant oatmeals.  I'm guessing<br />Quaker uses the sugar in their regular instants to entice children to eat oatmeal (it makes the oatmeal more like eating a cupcake or a pop-tart,) but I always go for the addition of more fruit over more sugar.<br /><br />And well done Amazon for always having fresh stock on hand.  My local market (out here in the middle of the desert nowhere) must get their stock from an un-air-conditioned warehouse that buys palettes and lets them sit for 2-3 years at a time.  Theirs never stays fresh past the first week or two -- while a box I misplaced from Amazon was still perfectly fresh when I found it 3 months later.<br />(applause)"
Good (for the most part),"I try to drink 1-3 cups of green tea everyday and this was a great way to try out so many different Stash green teas at once.<br /><br />The varieties included were (ordered May 2010):<br /><br />Chai Green - Very good chai, one of my favorites. Better than Celestial<br />Fusion Breakfast - Too much going on- mix of Indian Assam, Indonesian Black, Chinese Green, Japanese Green, African Black, and Japanese Matcha<br />Fusion Green & White - Good if you can't decide to have white tea or green tea, which happens every so often to me<br />Ginger Peach - not my cuppa, too much ginger and difficult to find the peach flavor<br />Organic Premium Green - very good<br />Moroccan Mint - Excellent, not quite as minty as peppermint herbal tea, but a nice balance of mint and green flavors<br />Pomegranate Raspberry - meh, okay when you're craving fruity but I wouldn't invest in a case of this<br />Premium Green - very good<br />Decaf Premium Green - Excellent, my kids drink this often<br /><br />After drinking tea for years with or without sweetener (no milk) I made a mistake one morning and put <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC"">Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup</a> into my tea with some cream (thinking it was coffee!) and I was blown away with the smooth, mellow taste. I now drink my tea with a little vanilla syrup and cream (less than I would use in coffee) and it's such an amazing flavor - like dessert. My daughter thinks it tastes like Yoplait vanilla yogurt. I highly recommend this!!!"
can be used espresso and regular drip,always liked lavazza.  there is no bitter aftertaste and find it both good for esspresso maker and regular drip depending on the strength that you like.  it was a great deal from amazon.
Expected More...,"I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food."
"Works great, but it's small and lets grinds through","I work with a vietnamese gentleman who turned me on to their style of coffee brewing, so I figured I'd check this out. After unboxing it I was surprised by how small the filter was. I like a good sized cup of coffee in the morning, so being so small was one downside for me at least. Assembly and use are easy and straight forward, but getting that screw top adjustment just right is a bit of a pain. I brew with this using true Hung Nguyen coffee and it does a great job, if not for the fact that it lets some coffee grinds through. For me, getting coffee grinds in my mouth triggers kind of a gag reflex, so I have to fish them out before drinking. Overall though, I'd say I'm happy with the product. It works well and was cheap enough to be worth it."
Spot on!,"First off, if you have never tried this on a steak, do yourself a favor and order this right now and try it. You can thank me later. Seriously, after you try this on your next steak, you will happily go to your frig and throw out the Heinz 57, A1, Lea and Perins etc. because from now on, you know. You have been enlightened, you have come to the light and found truth and taste. HP is that good. Nothing else tastes like it, sweet, savory, tangy, just right.  You will love it!"
Went bad,"I ordered this product in Sept. 2010.  I enjoyed this product very much.  I was introduced to Horchata through my aide who is from El Salvador.  I went to a BBQ and they had me try it.  I loved it so much I searched online and found this.  The first couple of boxes were excellent.  I have 1 open container in the fridge now.  I went to have some and it seems as though it fermented or just plain went bad.  I looked on the container and the best by date says  May 2011.  I have like 2 containers left, not open.  I'm afraid to try them."
Feline pine original cat litter.,"I have no problem with the shipping.  However, my cats don't like this litter.  I have mixed it with one they like better and I am hoping that things will get better."
Yummy Fruit Leather,"These are great!  Portable, tasty and natural.  It would be nice if they were organic.  I give these to my child in place of processed, sugary, so-called  ""fruit snacks""."
Smooth Coffee,"I absolutely love Community Coffee Dark Roast.  I enjoy it two ways.  I start my mornings off with a cup of it black. In the afternoon I have a cup with sugar & cream.  Its smooth, rich taste lets me enjoy it both ways!"
Broadway Strawberry Danish Ribbon Delfa Rolls,This is the candy that I would buy at the IGA Lopez in Ironwood Mi. back in the 1970's and when I found it back in production I had to buy it. Great old fashion type of licorice and fun to eat. they fit in your pocket and easy to share.
We have started putting it on everything,"My son-in-law first introduced us to Cavender's Greek Seasoning a few years ago. We started by adding it to shrimp and steaks but quickly found so many more things we enjoy it on as well. Grilled vegetables, hamburgers, baked french fries are just some of the foods this seasoning goes great on. Not overly salty or peppery, it's a hard to describe taste. Just that it seems to make any food that it's added to even more flavorful!"
Enjoyable Chai Experience,"****<br />Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as ""cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice"" and ""medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.<br /><br />The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.<br />****"
Not as flavorful as Makara Cinnamon,"I was hoping for a much stronger cinnamon flavor. But this cinnamon is more like the store bought McCormick cinnamon. Nothing realy fancy about it.  I am sticking with the Cinnabon Makara Cinnamon for my baking needs. Otherwise, this a ""standard"" cinnamon. Nothing special."
Wolfgang Puck Breakfast in Bed,This is my daughter's favorite K-cup product. Mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having Wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen.
Good Stuff!!,"I really like this mix - made it alongside a prime rib and mixed with buttered brussels sprouts - came out tender and succulent!<br /><br />Haven't tried in a soup, but it would probably be great in a vegetable soup.<br /><br />Good stuff!!"
Best popcorn Ever! Two thumbs way up,"The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPQOFO"">India Tree Paloma de Colores Popcorn, 3.4  lb</a> is just great. My wife and I purchased this as an alternative to microwave popcorn when we heard about all the chemicals present that were in microwave popcorn. Very few unpopped kernels and excelent flavor. And yes the differnet colored popcorn tasted differnet and have a slightly different shade once popped (still white). We ordered the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUWA"">Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper</a> to pop the popcorn. This product is also very good. Our 2yr old daugher loves making popcorn this way because she can watch. The only drawback to this method - VERY NOISY. My wife and I cant make popcorn for our evening movie because this wakes our daughter up. But all things considered. It is worth it."
It worked better for some than others,"This was a fun night. I got together a bunch of friends and we tried a bunch of different foods.  Some of the people had a much stronger reaction to it, but I didn't get too much from it.  Sour patch kids felt like they should have been sour, but they weren't at all.  Guinness did not taste like chocolate milk or a milk shake to anyone attending.  I think that is a myth put forward to sell more Guinness.  It was interesting for a night.  They didn't last very long though.  We each went through two tablets just to make it through the many foods we had."
Great Stuff,"Works great and as described, really helps when you have a lot to do. Similar to Red Bull. But cheaper @ W-mart..."
Great product for a great price!,"packed very well, arrived very quickly, very good $value<br />i love to use garlic pepper for about everything, it adds a great flavor to your meals, used for about past 6 years...."
These are awesome,"I love these bars.  It is almost like eating a piece of cherry pie, but so much better for you.  I wish I could afford to have them all the time!"
I'm in LOVE with this tea!,It is sinfully delicious and a nice way to end the day. But wait...I drink it all day! Yum!
Quality cat food,"I gave this to the family cat for Christmas this year and he likes it. He's not a very picky eater for a cat, but he turns his nose up at some things occasionally--this food was not one of those things. The ingredients that are used in the food are surprisingly ""sophisticated"",and should draw-in some of Amazon's more bourgeois pet owners."
Great tasting tea.,"We usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local Zen center. It is extremely easy to make, put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea.<br /><br />This tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass. Lemon grass has many health benefits. It is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels, this is important if you have gout.<br /><br />Because you get such a large quantity here on Amazon it should last you quite a while. Caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea.<br /><br />Give it a try!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review."
Great for long college classes,"I've only tried these a couple of years ago and don't remember my experience. This semester I have an advanced college class from 5pm to 10pm every Wednesday and it's after a couple hours of work and another class. I usually drink coffee in the morning so I don't want to push it and drink more before a long class late in the day.<br /><br />I ordered the 12 pack of Pomegranate last week and yesterday just before class I drank my 1st bottle. Within two minutes I was actually feeling more alert and energized. I'm a 22 year old guy who's somewhat active but not exactly in shape, and this made me feel like going out and exercising even though I had been rushing around most of the day. I would say the effects lasted past the 5-hour mark as I was still feeling awake and alert around midnight (7 hours after drinking a full bottle). Of course results will vary but mine excellent on the first try. I'll update next week or anytime thereafter if I have any negative or interesting effects.<br /><br />UPDATE 2-10-2011:<br />I held out and didn't try another bottle until my Wednesday class came around again and I had the same effects as last week. I was alert and able to enjoy the class while others were fatigued from the long day. I ended up staying awake until 4am and I'm not sure if that was because of the 5 Hour Energy but I don't usually stay up after 1am if I have work the following day, so beware if you're interested in this for late night applications."
Booda bones,My dog really enjoys the Booda bones.  I was very pleased with the price I received and also the fact that they arrived  earlier than expected.
Not for fine hair,no matter how I tried to massage this into my dry scalp it ended up all over my hair<br />okay this could be user error but it took some time to wash out<br /><br />It has a good feel and consistency however just did not work on my hair<br /><br />It is the consistency of a thick Valvoline --nice scent and my hand felt good after trying to apply it but not for thin hair
Good Coffee but expensive,"This is the first time I splurged on full Kona coffee.  I have been curious on how good this coffee would be.  It is very good coffee but this will be he last time I buy it.  For the cost, it is not worth it.  Amazon sells some great coffee for half the price of this one.  If you have unlimited cash flow than go for it as it is good and very smooth."
After Months Got it!,"I finally got the big fat gopher that has been ruining my garden. We dug down where I saw the activity and found the hole. We set the trap with no bait, covered it up and within a 1/2 hour he was caught. This trap works.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBMFDO"">Victor 0625 The BlackBox Gopher Trap</a>"
spaghetti sauce,just a short review about the case of spaghetti sauce i ordered...only had one problem...5 or 6 of the cans were dented...of course it did not affect the flavor or usability...thanks guys!!
Very delicious,These guys are delicious. Just make sure you air-tight seal them. They get stale fast and become rock hard. But they taste as good as any name brand gummies at the store.
It's not $32 a bottle.,"I make my own simple syrup, so anything over a buck is too much for me. But I guess you guys did not noice that it's 6 twelve oz. bottles for $32, which comes to $5.32 each. Still way too much in my opinion, but not 6X as much. Just sayin'."
Dogs like it,One 58 pound mixed breed and 2 chi babies all like this food and it is rated well on nutrition on analysis sites
Our family loves it!,"We love this chocolate syrup! After reading the ingredients in other brands I was so happy<br />to find this syrup. Organic and no HFCS. My whole family loves the taste. We use it for<br />chocolate milk, hot chocolate and over ice cream. Delicious!"
medium-grade tea with no distinctive apricot taste,"[Edit to add: A friend stayed at my house for a week recently and said ""This is the most delicious tea I've ever had in my life.""  She's a huge tea fan, so that is definitely saying something.  So, I've upped my star rating to a 4 (that's the average of my opinion (3) and her opinion (5)).  In light of her reaction, this tea may well be worth a try.]<br /><br />Original review:<br />I live in Japan where we drink oolong tea daily.  I usually buy my flavored teas in the US, because here in Japan they emphasize the aroma of the tea as it is brews rather than the taste, whereas in the US they emphasize the quality of the taste over the quality of the aroma.  This offers nothing outstanding in either area.  The aroma is present but nothing fantastic, and I can't taste the apricot in this at all.<br /><br />This is an upper medium-grade oolong tea, not the delicate high-grade Chinese oolong I was expecting at this price.  This is important because oolong tea is stunning when high-grade, perfectly nasty when low-grade, and merely OK when medium-grade.  It's upper medium-grade, so still very good, but not the stunning flavor I was expecting at this price.  (On reflection, perhaps the high price comes from the fact that it is organic, rather than from using only the highest-grade tea leaves.)<br /><br />Visually all the teas from this series are very appealing and they are ready to give ""as is"" if you need a housewarming gift, gift for your child's teacher, etc.  The package closes securely so you don't need to worry about the tea leaves not keeping well."
VERY DISAPPOINTED,I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
Awesome Marinade!,"I recently purchased this marinade when I was looking for something different to do to a pork loin.  My husband and I are big fans of smokey flavors (grilled, BBQ'd, etc.), so when I saw this item, I decided to give it a try.  I did cut holes in the pork loin and stuffed in whole cloves of garlic and also sprinkled the whole thing with meat tenderizer as well as this marinade (which I injected into the meat about every 2 inches or so).  I then put the whole thing in a zipper bag and marinaded it for 24 hours.  I then baked the loin in a shallow pan at 325 for about an hour (maybe a little longer).  When I cut into this loin, the juices just ran out all over it!  The pork was so tender and juicy and the flavor is just fantastic!!  I think this is just about the best marinade I've ever had!  If you like the taste of soy-ish flavored items, you'll love this.  It looks and smells a great deal like soy sauce, but has a smokey flavor.  My husband says this is WAY better than any of those pre-seasoned pork loins you buy in the store.  I also shared it with my best friend (who is an AWESOME cook) and she really liked it.  Gotta give this item a try!  I give it 10 out of 5 stars, because 5 isn't quite enough...."
Beware if you are allergic to Phenylalanine,"This product does not state it is ""Low Calorie Sugar Free"" you only find out when it arrives.  There is a small yellow flag stating it on the box.  I cannot use any artificial sweeteners as they cause a severe allergy attack.  This product has ""Phenylalanine"" an older artificial sweetener.  Grocery items are NOT ELIGIBLE for return.  Amazon did work with me and gave me a refund because it was not stated in the description.  As of today the product description has not changed so BEWARE."
Amazing crackers!!,"These crackers are so good that even my non-celiac partner and my son love them! We have them with all sorts of dips and cheeses- they have a great texture, a lot like pita crackers.We highly recommend them!!"
"Great, flavorful coffee","This is my breakfast coffee of choice.  Satifying, deep rich flavor gets the day started with a little oomph.  Two cups and I am ready to face the working world."
Cats seem to like it.,"The price was better than at the store. My cats seem to enjoy these shreds of ""meat"" in ""gravy"" (it doesn't look like meat or gravy to me). I add a little bit of water, but the like it the same without water added. I like the poultry flavors better than the seafood ones because they don't smell as much (and/or make the cats breath stink so badly)."
Yummy,"Do you like chocolate? Do you like marshmallows? Yeah, me too! I love mallomars! I hadn't had one in a long time when I received this package. Lets just say they didn't last long in my house. They were very fresh and the cookies were not broken even for being delivered in the mail. They taste fantastic."
Excellent!,"I don't generally crave candy or sweets that often, but if I have a weakness, it's sour lemon-flavored candy.  Here's the problem: I can never find one that satisfies me.<br /><br />Until now!  I have bought all sorts of different brands and types of sour lemon candies, in a bit of a ""search for the Holy Grail"" quest, and I believe I've found it.  These are absolutely great from start to finish.  They are sour all the way through, not like other candies that are coated with sour sugar, which gives you about 15 seconds of sour, and then are super-sweet the rest of the way.<br /><br />Everything about these is great, they're not too big and not too small.  And there's a bonus waiting for you in the middle:  A section of extra-sour lemony goodness that'll make ya pucker a little.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these aren't annoying sour, like Warheads (which again, only are sour on the outside), but they are certainly have more kick than, say, your average lemon drop by Brach's or similar products.<br /><br />I recently got my order of 2 lbs. of these, which will last me a while, but I will certainly be re-ordering these again when I run out.  I've shared these with other lemon-loving friends of mine and they have all agreed on the quality.<br /><br />The only con:  They are slightly pricey, but I feel like I got my money's worth so I would absolutely buy these again."
misses the mark,"This is a seitan (wheat protien) product with a strong anise (licorice) flavor that dominates the thai peanut taste. If you like black licorice, you may like this. Count me out."
Great Ice tea,Tried this out hot it is very tasty and it also makes the best ice tea. Wife makes 3  quarts at a time...8 bags and add a half cup of sugar and that is it !!!
$26 is too much...,"Just in case you don't know - these are about $4 a box at the store, so anything more than $12 for a 3 pack is not worth it.  This is a great product, though (that's what the 4 stars are for).  The pancakes & pizza dough are great, I make them all the time."
Much better than decaf,"Just got my first can of Pero at Whole Foods. It's absolutely delicious and does not give you the buzz like decaf sometimes does. It tastes similar to Taster's Choice decaf, but without the acidity! So far very happy with it, looked for a very long time and glad that I finally found it! In case anyone cares, it's made in Germany."
A high quality product - initially I misjudged this item,"I wrote a negative review as I was uncertain that this was truly blanched...the packaging is very clean and organic, and sure enough, it is blanched.  It was wonderful that the seller responded to my rating within hours...informing me of my error...so I tried it!  Nummy waffles this morning!  Thank you Anthony's Almonds for a great product at a really competitive price."
Great Deal,My dogs love the Veggie Life treats and the sell for much more in pet stores. Amazon price is the best I've seen and the treats are healthy for your puppies!
Not as good as I hoped,"Container is the round cup style, not the bowl style picture when I ordered. Noodles are a good cut and texture. Dried veggies are not as small as some (positive) with some decent mushroom pieces. However, the overall taste is not good enough that I could recommend or that I would buy again. I am basically saving the remainder for when I run low on groceries and for an emergency stash."
Good for a K-cup,No K-cup is going to be as good as a brewed coffee unless you like it weak but this is pretty good.  A bold rating is a necessity on K-cups just to get medium strong coffee.  If you buy several at once (because free shipping is at the $60 level) 11th Street Coffee is a couple of bucks cheaper.  Coupon codes are also easy to find for them.
Reese Anchovy stuffed olives,I love the Reese Anchovy stuffed olives.  They are not too salty but salty enough.  My mom and brother loves them too hence the purchase of two boxes.  One for them to share and the other all for me:)
Delicious Buy!,This French Tarlette is so great! I was very happy with my purchase. It is great to bring as a dessert to any type of occasion. Get it!
Good Tea Great Price,"This was just what I was looking for, a good Earl Grey Tea for an affordable price. If you like Earl Grey, you won't be disappointed with this."
Sencha Shot is the way to go.,Yes it does have a bold taste.  But I enjoy it.  If your a coffee drinker or you enjoy black tea you will like the taste of Sencha shot.  It's a bold taste with wonderful health benefits.
break easily- would NOT recommend,"I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby. The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray. Luckily I was right there because the utensils broken and shattered into small pieces that were very sharp. I think they could be very dangerous if he swallowed a shard or put the broken end in his mouth. I would not recommend these at all. Instead try the Green Sprouts silicone toddler spoon. It is soft and flexible and has not yet broken for me."
my dog love this,my dogs love this dog food.  their fur is healthier looking nicer and softer. the small bits are  great for my smaller dogs.
Horrible,I normally love Stash Tea but this flavor is bad. It has a very weird chemical type taste. At first I thought it might just be me so I made my wife a cup and she yelled out to me from the other room that this is the worst tea that I have made for her. Too bad I bought the 100 count! I guess I will have to look for another flavor.
Soda Substitute that tastes Similar to the Original,"I'm always on the lookout for soda's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals. Switch's ingredients are: Filtered Water, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). It also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy. One can contains 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin A. It also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it.<br /><br />The taste of Switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has. I personally don't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet. I can see kid's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda. 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8.3 ounces of a drink. I would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids."
Pugs love ZiwiPeak!!!,"A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.<br /><br />From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:<br />After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!"
Very Nice Shampoo,"This is a thick shampoo that lathers well and has a good scent that is not too strong. I normally only use non-sulfate shampoos, but this shampoo was pretty moisturizing and left my hair soft. I have long, thick wavy hair that gets frizzy and dry easily. I sometimes use coconut oil to keep my hair in an up-do during the day and this shampoo washes it out with no problems. I would still alternate this shampoo with a non-sulfate one since I wash my hair daily, but overall it's a good shampoo. It comes in one of those nice flat type bottles that you can turn upside down when the amount gets low.<br /><br />One complaint about the packaging - It arrived in an envelope and the shampoo had exploded out. The bottle was wrapped in plastic, so it was easy to unwrap and clean with a towel, but I hope that customers ordering this product receive it with better packaging."
My cats love it!,My 3 cats can't get enough of these treats. A great product at a great price AND fast shipping. What more can 3 cats ask for?
Terrific,"Not only are the Redskins real Redskins and not little peanuts with their coats on, the service is incredible...  I mentioned a slight shipping issue when initially reviewing, and they sent me a complimentary 40 oz can...<br /><br />  I cannot recommend them HIGHLY enough.<br /><br />Thank you very much,<br /><br />Bill Condon"
Great value compared to purchasing from Vet,"My 5-year old lab mix gets one of the X-Large chews every evening, and he loves them.  I've never had to have his teeth cleaned because the chews, combined with a little brushing every now and then, really work well at keeping build-up off of his teeth.  A bit of a warning. . .don't let the dog have one of these when you're not around.  More than once my dog has tried to swallow the last ""little"" piece which gets stuck in his throat and has to be removed."
very pleased,"I am very pleased with the product, the service and the price.  The Guar Gum is great to use to thicken smoothies and low in calories."
a little too strong,I found the coffee to be a little to strong for my taste. Many times I had to let the pod<br />go a second time to get the coffee I like
Picky cat loves this,I have a cat with chronic liver disease and she is very picky about what she eats.  This is one of the few cat foods I can get her to eat.
LOVE!,These are great and it's a wonderful way to get a taste of chocolate each day. It contains chocolate with almonds and dark chocolate which in a sizeable amount for your daily chocolate fix.
open bags,Product came in open and leaking in the box. I contacted Amazon and a full refund was issued no fuss no muss. I then ordered the same product only in the little plastic buckets. That worked out much better.
Great vanilla beans!,These beans were nice and plump and full of flavor. Not dry and shriveled at all. They were exactly what I was hoping for. Would definitely recommend!
This is what converted me,"Brewed coffee is almost non-existent where I am from, and we in our family would almost always buy instant coffee. Brewed coffee never tasted quite right or coffee like to me before. But one day my brother brought home some free samples of this. Then I understood why people loves brewed coffee. The flavor and taste simply blew me away."
Great way to start my day!,"I have one large mug of lychee tea every morning and I really like this brand.  The aroma is delicate and not overpowering in the morning.  This company's tea is the nicest I have found.  The leaves are also nice and large, not little dust mites!!!  I have been drinking this flavor for several years and truly enjoy it.  Much nicer than other brands I have also tasted/tested :)  Hope you enjoy it as well."
I am not sure how to do reviews about water,"Like another review said, ""It's water.""<br /><br />Clear, refreshing, water.  The taste?  Watery.  Meaning next to no taste.<br />After effects?  I was hydrated, just like most water does.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I could buy this water, be hydrated and it doesn't have any funky taste.  But I could do the same thing with my water filter."
Eden kukicha tea,"I love this tea, hard to find in stores, great that I can get it on auto ship and know I will have it."
Delicious,"I love these Just Grapes snacks!  They are so yummy and addicting.  Slightly chewy, and very sweet.  Highly recommended."
My 3 cats all eat it!,"I was very happy to see a natural dry cat food at Walmart.  I've fed my three cats (ages 11, 6, and 5) this food for months and they all like it.  No diarrhea, no barfing, no problems.  I checked the FDA recall list and it is NOT on it.  The closest search match on the FDA site is NUTRO Natural, not the same product..."
Poor copy,"This jerky is; tough, fat, has gristle, and does not taste like teriyaki. They do not even try to make it with the right flavorings. If you like teriyaki get another product."
Perfect Shower Favor,Hosting a baby or wedding shower with lots of attendees? Choose these. Relatively cheap and easy to order. The distributor did an excellent job in accommodating my request for delivery.
LOVE!!!!,i LOVE this!!! It has such a good flavor and fills you up. I felt full longer than most other bars!
They have a strange taste. Much worse than baked Lays or Pringles.,"I was disappointed with the taste of these chips (regular and barbecue). I can't really taste the potato, so it is almost like eating a badly-flavored foam chip. It tastes like it is stale even though it is fresh, and it also has an odd chemical-like taste. The similar baked lays and pringles chips are very tasty. My kids finally ate the rest of these chips, but only after all of the other chips were gone."
Wow,That's all I can say.  Wow.  I like the saag but this one is much better.
Disappointed,I've been eating these bars for years and I've notice that lately that the quality is not<br />as good as they were before.  They have these hard things in them that can break your<br />teeth! So quality control is not being monitored and I'm going to call the company and<br />let them know that the last 4 boxes I've purchased are not up to par. They taste really<br />good as long as you don't bite into something hard. It's like biting into a nutshell<br />and they need to know this asap.
Delicious and great price,These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.  You can't find this flavor in most stores and the typical Blue Diamond can is much more expensive else where.
liza,I ordered these items very close to halloween and thought that I would not receive them on time.  To my surprise I received the package a few days early.  All items were packaged  individually which made it very easy to pass out.  The time it took between my order and the receipt of the candy was very prompt and everything was in perfect order.
The best Kona yet,"There are many claimants to the title of Best Kona Coffee. Like Lancelot searching for a king worthy enough to serve I have tried many Kona brands and found most to be wanting. When Starbucks was worth their reputation good Kona was available from them by phone order only. That was 15 years ago. It's been pretty disappointing but the good news is that Blue Horse Kona Coffee is making up for lost time. With a little imagination you can actually taste the black soil of Hawaii and feel the Trade Winds in this coffee. There is no other way to describe the smooth, delicious flavor and aroma that seems simple but has the complexity of a good wine wih several flavors one experiences during the beginning, middle and the wonderful finish."
Caution: Kettle Chips are addictive!,These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese...it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters (like me)will enjoy these.
McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal,"This is a great product; however, don't do what I did.  Make sure to look for recipes specific to steel cut oatmeal.  My first coffee cake was a disaster because I substituted this for old-fashioned oatmeal.  The coffee cake could have broken someone's teeth! :-)  Since then I've located some recipes to use that are specifically for steel cut oatmeal.  I'll definitely buy this product again when we're out.  Love it!!!"
Delicious and cheaper than the 4-pack,Precious Divinity Chai is the most delicious beverage mix I have ever purchased. It's addictive. Buying the three-pound single bag provides the same amount of chai mix as the four-pack but for $4 cheaper. Only downside is I wish I had kept the old containers so that I could keep one at work and one at home!
Too Expensive Here,"I like the product itself but price here is too high. Now (Apr 2011) you can buy the same set of 12 tomato paste jars at vitacost for $33.54, it's 64% of current Amazon price."
Love all HappyBaby Tots!,"My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!"
Tasty,This is a good combo of ingredients.  The batch I received was fresh enough and had no problems with it.  Had plenty of healthy ingredients in it and would get it again if on sale again like when I got it.
We love this tea.,We have ordered this product twice and the quality and freshness is always optimal.  We are always amazed at the quick delivery by Amazon.  Thank you!!  Steve and Debi Watson
Tastes pretty good!,"I'm not a fan of the milky, sugary ""chai tea"" that you get in coffee houses, but I do like all of the spices that go into masala chai.  (FYI - according to Wikipedia, the word ""chai"" means ""tea"".  Masala chai refers to the spiced tea.  ""Chai tea"" means ""tea tea"".)  This particular version of Masala Chai contains Assam black tea (that's from India), cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, cloves, and ""natural flavors"".  I'm not sure what those ""natural flavors"" are, but I like the other ones.  (OK, to be honest, I'm not sure what plain cardamon tastes like, but I frequently put cinnamon and cloves in my plain tea, and the cardamon doesn't seem to be screwing up the flavor of this tea.)<br /><br />I steeped the tea for 3 minutes.  It tasted fine, but it tasted a little better with about a quarter teaspoon of sweetener.  That punched up the cinnamon, ginger, and clove flavors (and probably the cardamon's too) without making it sweet.<br /><br />As of this writing, you can get 6 boxes of this for $18 on subscribe & save.  This is definitely worth $3 for a box of 20.  This has a lot of flavor without tasting like Kool Aid."
Smooth and Delish,"First I want to say that it's absolutely horrible that Libby is selling dented cans through Amazon.  That is just shameful, and I'm assuming this results from the fact that Libby was purchased by Nestle, a company with a less than stellar reputation.<br /><br />In any case, what I wanted to comment on was the actual pumpkin part of the experience.  And here I have no complaints.  The ONLY ingredient listed is 'Pumpkin'.  And for those of you who have nut allergies like me, you should know that there are NO warning notes on the can.  (One should always check though because different cans could come from different factories.)  But on the cans I have there is no mention that there 'might' be nuts.<br /><br />In consistency, I've always found the puree to be flawless.  No lumps or dark spots.  To all appearances a wholesome product which is high in Vitamins C and A.<br /><br />Good for pies and muffins.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/pie maker"
delicious cruelty-free crackers!,these are the best animal crackers i've ever tasted! the chocolate simply adds to the deliciousness. they taste like mini-cookies. they are vegan and thus cruelty-free! organic and yummy. what more can be asked of an animal cracker!
Wonderful food!,"I highly recommend this product. It's a great source of protein, amino acids and It keeps me regular :)...I mix it with rice milk, rice protein, coconut milk, banana and blueberries. It just delicious!  A lot people have this misconception that hemp will make you high. But It doesn't. They don't add any chemicals to it. Remember It comes from the seeds. I love hemp protein! I used to spend a lot of money at Lassesns,  but not anymore :)"
Very Happy Dog,"And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating."
AMAZING!,"I can't say enough good things about this food. Our puppy (American Staffordshire) was on Puppy Chow when we got her. After reviewing many different foods I decided to switch her to Blue Buffalo. We did a slow transition mixing first a quarter cup, then half, and so on until she was fully switched. Her stool was fine and her coat immediately began showing the difference. Her energy picked up and she loves it! We also mix in a tablespoon or so of the Blue Buffalo canned food which just adds to the flavor for her. This is a great product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality dog food at a reasonable price."
"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
"Yummy - good enough for me to eat, let alone the baby!","Very good baby food, good taste and texture.  The baby gobbled it down and I snuck a taste to find it was really good.  I like the organic nature of it - I feel good feeding him something that I feel is better than processed food."
Dogs love it,"I have 2 big dogs and they LOVE these treats in their everlasting balls.  My Golden Retriever can make one treat last 2 days, but the black lab cruches the ball and eats the entire thing in 30 minutes."
Nostalgia,"I used this product alot back home and couldn't find it halal anywhere close by when I came to the US. I hit upon this page by chance and ordered one for myself. Package arrived a few days later in good condition with a load of time left before expiry (around an year left). Very satisfied, I'll be ordering this item frequently."
My favorite pretzels,I don't eat Gluten so I am always looking for good Gluten Free snacks. Most are  like sawdust -- These taste better than regular pretzels.  I highly recommend them.
Cooks In Can,My wife takes these with her when she is traveling since they cook in the can.  I've never eaten them.  The can is too small at 10.75 ounces for a big eater like me.
The absolute best herbal tea,"My sister suggested this tea to me.  I was looking for a good herbal tea to limit my caffeine, and one I could have in the evening.  Most herbal teas seem very weak to me.  I'm not a big licorice fan, but this doesn't taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.  It's great in the evening when I'm craving something sweet - and no calories or caffeine!"
M&M's,"it is difficult to review a product that I never received, but paid for, however, that being said, I purchase M&M's often and they are an excellent item and they are enjoyed by my staff at work.  Just wish I would have received what I ordered especially since I could have purchased for half the prioe at Costco"
Excellent tool,Excellent tool for those who cannot stir natural peanut butters without painting the kitchen in it.
Awesome taste!,The banana bread taste better then most banana breads we have tasted.  Pancake made with this mix are light and fluffy and taste great too. I can't wait to make cookies from it too. Finding good tasting gluten free mix is hard to do but we have found the best!
My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!,"When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old."
So Far So Good,"I saw these new Zoe treats <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QRPH78"">Zoe Low Calorie 6.2-Ounce Chew Sticks, Small</a>and decide to try them. My dog (My Best Friend) Sophie is an 8 year old 9 pound Poodle Maltese mix with a very sensitive stomach. I've found very few treats that she can eat without throwing them up. I thought I would try Zoe treats since they had all natural ingredients and I have very few choices so far that Sophie likes. Well - So far so good, Sophie loves the treats and no problems with her stomach. Because of Sophie's sensitive stomach and size I give her ½ of a stick at a time and she likes then so well she begs for more. It's nice to find a healthy treat that my Sophie likes."
AWFUL TASTE,"Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called ""Vinegar and Sea Salt"" - not ""Sea Salt and Vinegar""."
Yuck!  Far too salty!,"Same complaint I made elsewhere.  This product is so horribly salty I can't taste the seasoning.  I won't buy it again.  Now, I won't throw it away, though.  I'll use it as salt.  That's all it is.  It's just salt, and when I put on the appropriate amount of salt, I won't expect to taste any seasoning (despite the claim on the package that when it's salty enough, it's seasoned to perfection).  My partner says he used to use Tony's many years ago, and that something has changed.  Says it wasn't so dreadfully salty back then."
Time for tea!,"This tea is lovely for a refreshing iced tea, a comforting hot tea or mixed into a light Sangria.  'Hard to find, but worth the effort."
Yummy & super easy.,My baby loves these. & we can bring them anywhere since they're not glass and we don't need anything since he can just suck on it as is. & have to love the fact it's organic.
Tastes Good and Healthy and Bubbly,"I quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them.  I do, however, like bubbly drinks, but I don't need the sugar or sodium.  That's why this product is perfect.  It is 100% fruit juice, carbonated for the bubbliness.<br /><br />Orange is one of my favorite flavors.  This drink is the perfect drink.<br /><br />I think this product is even better than orange soda; orange soda is sticky, but this product is not.  It has the perfect amount of sharpness - which I love.  Because it is 100% fruit juice, it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness.<br /><br />So this product is all the good things rolled into one:<br /><br />100% fruit juice<br />No added sugar<br />Bubbly<br />Awesome orange flavor<br /><br />It's so good, it's hard to believe you're drinking something healthy."
safety concern,"This container was delivered about an hour ago in a cardboard box with other food items. So far no problem, but after taking this 24 oz container out of the box I noticed it had no tight plastic wrapping around it that could protect it from tampering.<br />After opening the cover i noticed there was a round paper right under the cover that is supposed to be glued completely around the top of the container. This paper was only glued half way around the container.... in other words, there is the possibility of tampering with this product. I cannot trust it, so even though the parmesan cheese smells good i would rather not take chances on that one."
Good Stuff,"Not sure of the calorie count, but this is a good product.  It beats the national brand as far as quality. C'mon, can you go wrong with Larry?"
Everyone Loves 'Em,This is an almost unique product that everyone we serve them to loves.  It has a great taste and far less fat and calories than similar snacks.  A real winner.
Nice Flavors,The pops are less expensive at my local Wally World.  Additionally I could not help but think that the products were factory seconds. Too many ill formed pops.  They taste the same though.
Not What I Expected,"I ordered these sugarless Twizzlers to replace the regular Twizzlers I love so much. My goal was to still eat Twizzlers, but cut down on calories.<br /><br />It didn't work. The first thing I saw on the package was ""Not a low calorie food."" Bummer! As far as taste was concerned, it wasn't bad, but these Twizzlers tasted a bit on the dry side, unlike the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the regular product.<br /><br />So, while it was a good try, these Twizzlers did not replace regular Twizzlers and I will probably not be purchasing them again."
"Taste great, not messy","My daughter officially gives these 5 stars - she just loves them.  These were her first finger food, and they remain her favorite.  I'll add my own 5 stars because they're an easy, convenient snack, and unlike Cheerios, they don't make a mess when the child is just learning to eat (the Cheerios were dribbling out of her mouth and onto her clothes); I suspect it's because the fruit puffs dissolve more quickly.  I'm not crazy about the price - 1.48 oz. isn't exactly a huge amount - but on the other hand, I don't give her that many, so a canister lasts a few weeks (vs. the recommended six servings).  Giving it in smaller quantities should also alleviate concerns about sugar in the product (sugar is the fifth ingredient in the banana puffs)."
Kamut is a type of wheat,"Was trying to get a wheat free cereal only to discover that Kamut is a type of wheat.  Live and Learn!<br />It's very tasty, smells wonderful, my husband loves it.  It's super-sized puffed exotic wheat."
"Not up to the hype, caused bloody stools in my puppy","I purchased this food upon recommendation from my vet. They told me that they had previously used the Holistic brand but it had merged with this company & they did not have experience with Eagle Pack but that they thought it was the same. I slowly added the food to my puppy's old food over the next week and she seemed to like it just fine. Well, she started having a lot of loose stools, many of which were completely liquid and even bloody for the next couple of weeks. I decided to try another food and everything completely resolved. I have since tried a couple of puppy foods equal in quality/price/reputation with no problems. Her stools are completely better, now soft but formed (like they should be!) with no sign of blood whatsoever. She has not had any gastrointestinal problems on numerous different kinds of treats either. She has been fine on 3 puppy foods, a dozen different kinds of treats...you do the math.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what the problem may have been from the ingredient list and my concern is the ""triple animal proteins"" combining chicken, pork and fish meals. This is just an invitation for food intolerance because there are more potential allergens. I think the pork is the problem. I know she tolerates chicken & chicken meal fine, not sure about fish but I've seen that frequently in other foods while I have yet to find another quality food that contains pork meal. Pig does not seem akin to a domestic dog's ""natural"" diet anyway. If they got rid of the pork, I might consider trying it again but until then I'd recommend you try another food for your puppy. I think (hope) they are generally a good company and I do see that some people's dogs have been fine on this brand, but I'm not sure this is the safest food for baby animals. I will NOT be purchasing this again & I will be contacting my vet recommending that they no longer carry it in their store. There are so many better, safer options out there. If you care about your puppy's health and happiness, save her weeks of misery and buy something else!"
Coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine,"I figured I would give this 11-ounce package of ""Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored"" a chance to prove my bias against flavored coffees was groundless. The smell of the flavoring--be it real vanilla, imitation vanilla, or something that isn't vanilla at all but smells like someone's idea of vanilla--escapes even from the sealed bag to the point I decided not to keep this coffee near the rest of my stash. After opening the bag, I involuntarily snapped my head away, fearing my olfactory system might be under siege by the sickly sweet smell.<br /><br />Next was to try this coffee, and I admit my courage faltered when I considered what an unadulterated cup of this vanilla flavored coffee might taste like in the morning as I prepared the coffee and set the timer. So I mixed in a good dose of regular coffee, probably three-fifths regular, two-fifths vanilla flavored.<br /><br />Well, first impression is that using the word ""natural"" to describe this flavor would be a reach until I remembered that just because something does not have an appealing smell does not mean it is not natural and that perhaps these vanilla bean received the same treatment as civet coffee. The coffee seems to burn slightly as it goes down, and tastes overly sweet even without any extra sweetener. I needed that second cup at 6:15 a.m. far more than I wanted it, and I will not be drinking this brew again except as iced coffee and even then, not without cutting it with some regular coffee to help constrain the cloying flavor that coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine."
Great product,"Based on what other reviewers said about how this was just prunes and nothing else, I bought this product hoping they were correct and there are no preservatives, and there aren't. I'm allergic to the sulfites usually used as preservatives with dried fruit, so to get this--organic, without preservatives--was perfect.<br /><br />The prunes are excellent quality--large, soft, moist without being overly mushy. One reviewer said they were dry, but I didn't experience that.<br /><br />The package also says clearly to refrigerate after opening, so I did that. It was nice to see the reminder.<br /><br />The package is easy to tear open and resealable, which was great since I had to put it in the fridge.<br /><br />Overall, excellent product.<br /><br />Camy"
Super product,"This Chi is amazing! Could get it at Sams Club before but they stopped suppling it all of a sudden. Amazon was a good price and if I ordered enough, I got free shipping yeah! Saved gas money going to Sams!. Wish I could get it in the 320z cans from Amazon though."
"I have had better ""Jalapeno Kettle Chips""","These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could."
so-so,"These are pretty flavorful, and fairly tasty, however there is trans fat in them (even though its not listed in the nutritional info, anything with 'hydrogenated' or 'partially hydrogenated' anything is a trans fat, but since it is less than a gram per serving they don't have to list it).<br /><br />There are much better candies out there, and there are also worse candies out there."
Organic,My family really likes that this is organic chocolate syrup.  It tastes great and we haven't had a problem mixing it with cold milk for chocolate milk.  We also use it on ice cream.  We're so glad that Amazon is including this item.
Huge Rip Off!,Wow! I've been buying dog treats for over 40 years and this one takes the cake! Pay no attention to the photo in the advertisement for this product. What you get is two (2) small chews in each of three (3) shrink wrapped over cardboard packages. That's a total of six (6) small chews for $30.00 not including shipping! I couldn't return my order quick enough.
My Dogs Love It,"I have 3 dogs - a Greyhound, a Boston Terrier, and a Rat Terrier mix.  They all love the Purina Beneful Original Dog Food and anxiously will sit and wait for me to serve it to them.  They all have received healthy vet reports, so I know it's good for them.  Of course, I do not overfeed them and exercise them as regularly as possible.  I highly recommend this product."
Potentially messy but my dog loves it.,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is ""All-Natural with Vitamins,"" that there is only ""1 calorie in every 10 licks"" and that there are ""over 500 licks per bottle.""  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week."
Reminds me of Sunday at Nanna's,"These are so delicious and dense with pistachios. They are soft but chewy, and not overly sweet compared to some other brands.  They arrived fresh from Amazon.  I have been eating torrone since childhood, and this brand is now one of my favorites."
Love these bars!,"I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them."
Tasty stuff,"I tend to like hot cereals, and thought that our family could give these grits a try. They're pretty darn good! I haven't had grits before, though, so I don't know how 'authentic' they are."
YAY!!! first 5 star rating,This was my first time with marzipan and right off the bat I was thinking s#!+ that's more than I want to pay for so little candy but when it came in and I saw my wife's face light up it was worth every penny she said it brought her back to when her grandma would bring her some all in all well worth it
Wow its good!,"I would recommend this product to everyone. There are no bones nor skin, just the meat of the salmon. It is a very good product."
Horrible Texture!!!,I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they really really bad. Good luck to all who are brave enough to gamble their $$$
The Best!,"This is definitely the best canned tuna I have ever had. No off taste at all, almost chicken like in taste and texture. I drained most of the oil, added a squeeze of lemon and simply enjoyed. Awesome!"
Tasty.  Not sure about health claims.,"I have no idea whether this aids your digestion in any way or not.  I doubt it, actually.  But this is a tasty, high energy snack.  It's easy to eat too much, actually, due to the great mixture of flavors.  Would be great for hiking and camping.<br /><br />Mine seemed fresh, was shipped promptly, and arrived in good condition."
excellent product,"Excellent product,  tastes great, easy to make, no negatives as far as I can see......"
Looks better than the pictures shows,"I've been a Megaman fan all my life, and although I don't ""collect"" a lot of megaman items. I do enjoy collecting different kinds of unique bottles, glasses, drinks etc. So this made a nice little addition to my collection.<br /><br />The picture shown doesn't do it justice. I was very happy with the picture quality, and looks a lot better than they show on here."
New Look and some flavors changed too without notice,"suddenly there is papaya, passion fruit and strawberry. Lemon, green apple and ?? are gone.  Bag says ""New look! Same great taste"".  Maybe this will break my addiction.  NO GRAPE!"
Yes gluten free and tastes GOOD!,"I have Celiacs disease and must eat a gluten free diet or I get very ill.  It is great to find a cereal that NEVER makes me ill! It is 100% gluten free!<br /><br />I also love the taste of this gluten free cereal! This cereal is like corn flakes but without being boring! In fact, I mix them with plain puffed rice to lessen the fruity flavor because I like milder tastes and do not have a big sweet tooth.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this cereal and highly recommend it to people on gluten free diets...<br />BUT if you can eat whole grain cereals like wheat and oats EAT THOSE INSTEAD because they contain FIBER which is very needed in keeping your digestive tract healthy.<br />This cereal is created and designed for those of us who cannot eat whole grains.<br /><br />MY FAVORITE CEREAL MIX:<br />1. Gorella munch<br />2. Gluten Free Rice puffs<br />3. Amazon Flakes<br />The mixture is SO good that even non-Celiacs want to eat it!"
My every morning tea,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
cheaper but still taste good,"This review is for French roast<br /><br />With a pinch of dark brown sugar make it tastes the way i like.<br />This Kcup is lighter than regular brand only 11g(others 14-16g)Made with thin plastic cup & foil.<br />The label is cute, bold enough for me & cheaper than others brand."
I wish the food I ate was so reliably healthy,Reading up on this company I'm blown away by the care and knowledge that goes into this food.  I can't even know if I'm getting gentically modified food or other junk when I go eat lunch today but here there is an approach to pet food I hope I can enjoy one day as a human.  I would trust anything this company puts on the market!  I hope this level on integrity catches on with other companies.
Green Tea Moisturizer,Feels great on my skin. The only thing about it that bothers me at all is the smell. It's not a bad smell and it's not that strong but I'm pretty sensitive to scents. It probably wouldn't bother most people at all but you might want to be aware if you have allergies or are really sensitive to smells.  I only mention it because I suffer from migraines and scents can be a trigger for me. The product works wonderful for my skin and I love the way green tea makes my skin feel so refreshed.
Terrible Tea,"This has to be some of the worst tasting tea I have ever tried.  It leaves my tongue with a somewhat raw feeling.  The flavors must be all artificial and not natural,and there really isn't much of any flavor that can be tasted.  If someone handed you a cup of tea it would be pretty hard to tell the flavor.  Don't waste your money on this.  You can get much better tea at Walmart that cost a lot less.  The box the tea comes in is very cheap, and relly isn't worth anything.<br />Jim"
A has-been,"I used to use this brand all the time and loved it, but they've changed their formula.  The latest is marked ""gluten free"" and has virtually no heat and little taste.  Now I'm searching for a new brand."
Love this!,"I bought this coffee for my in-laws because I know they like organic. Because the order came with three bags, I decided to take a bag for myself. I bought the whole bean and was immediately impressed with the condition and appearance of the beans. They were somewhat oily and appeared to be fresh. The coffee its self was fantastic. I didn't know if I would like the chocolate, but that flavor is very mild and actually a nice touch. Well, long story short, I am now ""subscribed"" to this coffee for regular monthly orders. Thanks Amazon!"
vipsusie,Butterfinger hot chocolate is very good. It taste like a butterfinger candy bar. I like using it with my coffee for special treat. I get the satisfaction of the candy bar with a lot less calories and being warm/hot it is extremely comforting.
FREIGHT POSTAGE OUTRAGEOUS,"GREAT, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED, ARRIVED ON TIME, OR AT LEAST AS BEST AS I CAN RECALL NOW. MUST FIND ANOTHER WAY TO ORDER THIS POSTAGE OUTRAGEOUS"
This is not coconut oil,"I'm using Nutiva coconutoil since 2008, and I always bought 54oz pacakge. This time I bought 15oz and it's nothing compared to the 54 oz. This is not cocnut oil at all. It is more like dalda(vanaspati)in cosistency and has no coconut flavor/smell at all. I'm disappointed in this product!"
"Great Size, Great Bag, Great Candy",Worked out perfectly for the candy bar at my wedding!  Great size.  Resealable bag works well.  Arrived perfectly fresh.  Good crowd pleaser!
Coconut bars?,"These are good but not as good as the other Kind bars I've had.  I think it was because the coconut seems to overwhelm the other flavors.  I love apricot, which is why I ordered these, but I can barely taste the apricot due to the strong coconut flavor."
Pure Jalapeno Powder,Excelent product. Smells and tastes just like it is supposed to - jalapenos. Adds great flavor to any dish requiring jalapenos. I've added it to hamburgers - very good flavor!
Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillet Kit,"The prep on this item is super easy, requiring only about 15-20 minutes of my time to create a full meal for two. So that's pretty awesome. As far as taste (even more important), it's really good, nothing that great or life changing, but definitely tasty. So, a quick, easy, nice tasting meal is a good meal in my book."
What a great value!!,Fantastic Nylabones!!  $8 a piece at ANY store.  Nylabones are the only bones my dogs  can eat without destroying it in 5 minutes.  They last me about 2-3 weeks.  Great value!!
Lacking,"A so so presentation sealed in plastic, and tied with a bow, of 2 packages 12 oz. pasta, one bottle 22 oz. sauce and 3 sealed Biscotti (age of ingredients indeterminate), with a thin cotton towel, all nestled within a stainless colander.  If purchased separately at retail, approximately $27. Quality of ingredients typical of what can be obtained locally. I'm just not impressed by any of it."
These are freaking delicious.,"My sister discovered these not too long ago and raved about them, and finally this morning I ate one for breakfast before a sprint triathlon. YUM YUM YUM. By the lightness of the package I would've thought it was a piece of cardboard, but no, it's a flat waffle-shaped piece of heaven. It's really the first non-gross food geared toward working out I have come across. Excuse me while I buy out Amazon's entire supply. FRICKIN DELICIOUS."
Delicious!,I love the Phillippine dried mango products because they are not too dry and have a very authentic mango flavor.  One of my favorite snacks.
Better than regular Jello,"I purchased Jeanies jello after a street fair in NYC where our bar was serving jello shots for the occasion. But because I'm a vegetarian and do not eat gelatin, I was left out of the fun and realized a bunch of other people had<br />the same issue and they asked if there was any that were gelatin free. So that night I ordered Jeanies animal free jello and could not believe how amazing it was. Way better than traditional jello!! There is no difference with the texture and it honestly tastes more flavorful. I ordered all strawberry flavored and the nice people at Jeanies sent me a flavor sampler pack to try in addition to my order. Our restaurant now only serves animal free jello due to the tramendous customer response."
"Great tea, and a great deal",The tea is excellent and buying bulk allowed me to pay a much cheaper price w/o tax AND it was delivered to my door.  What more could ask other than to have the UPS guy come in and make the tea for me. I say YES to this purchase if you are considering.
Wonderful cereal,"This is a wonderful GF cereal!  It is crunchy, a touch sweet, and the fruit is a wonderful addition.  This is the first GF cereal that my son will really eat. He frequently has 2 bowls, and he does not eat much!  Highly recommend."
Honey & Sesame--what's not to like?,"I've been enjoying this candy concoction since the late 60s. One used to have to go to a health food store to buy it and it came as a larger bar. A fresh-tasting and satisfying snack. Bought from this seller, each pound is packed in a nice ziplock bag which will no doubt keep it fresh longer--not that it's going to be around that long!"
Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix,Excellent pancakes!  I prefer this product to any of the regular pancake mixes I have used.
All my favorites in one bag,"I recently received a complimentary box of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> from the distributor. After sampling all of the flavors, I realized I really was a traditionalist and loved the fruit flavors the best.<br /><br />While the sampler comes in a beautiful box appropriate for gift giving, let's be honest, it only has 1/2 pound. And this bag has a full pound. Even more, it has a full pound of my favorites.<br /><br />While I do recommend that you try the sample pack for a well rounded experience, you won't go wrong with this package. Made with fruit flavors so real you want to check for seeds, the real flavorings and lack of artificial flavoring is a big plus for me, since I struggle with allergies in this area.<br /><br />David is the original creator of the Jelly Belly, and he has returned, better than ever with these. Where the jelly belly won our hearts with their intensity, these will win out with their true-to-life flavor. It is as though the originals were made for children, these were made for adults.<br /><br />If you are a soda fan, you might want to consider his other mild assortment <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBMAS8"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Soda Fountain Mix</a>.<br /><br />While I appreciated the complimentary samples, now I have a serious problem, I don't ever think I'll be able to eat the lesser varieties without comparing them. I  checked, and I can't buy them locally ... Yet ... But fortunately I can buy them here on Amazon.<br /><br />I really do appreciate good tasting candy, and while it is pricy, it is very good."
Great for getting your fiber up...not for the weak stomach peeps,"I have been eating Fiber One bars for 2 years now, and I've lost 50lbs. I am a runner and I'm always thinking of ways to increase my fiber intake. Luckily Fiber One products have me covered. These bars are so easy to take with you; to the gym, work, lunch, as a snack! I buy them in bulk now and enjoy them in my lunches. The recommended amount of fiber a person should have a day is about 18-25 grams...and this one little bar can take care of 9 of those grams! How awesome is that?!  I love the chocolate ones the best, but they now have a new one call chocolate mocha! And the gas that people have talked about on these reviews goes away once your body is able to handle more fiber. I have none of those side effects now.  Enjoy!"
YUMMMMM!!!!,We have three darling Shitzus.  All of them adore Booda Bones and look forward to this wonderful treat.  Thank you Amazon!!
My favorite flavor,"When you were a kid, did you ever pick a grape fresh off the vine and squeeze the insides of it into your mouth?  If you did and you loved grapes as much as I did, that is exactly what the White Grape flavor tastes like.<br /><br />The Diet Rite products are sweetened with Splenda, and what's more important to me, they have no sodium at all (besides no calories, carbs or caffeine).<br /><br />This flavor tastes nothing like what you'd expect - so if you are expecting what purple grape usually tastes like, this will be a disappointment.  I hate purple grape flavor, this is completely different and tastes great."
Pond water would taste better..,"Stale, tastless crap. Dont bother. The hassle to return is riduclous, you have to pay and it has to be thrown out anyway, Why put customer thru all this for cheap little item."
I agree! $20 cheaper direct from Nespresso!!,"I juat placed my first order through Nespresso.  An assortment of 50 capsules of four different flavors was $36 including shipping.<br /><br />Most pods are 55 cents each.  Some are 62 cents.  Minimum order is 50 pods, so for their BEST blends that is $31 for the pods plus $6 or $7 shipping."
Good quality and a fair price,"For some reason, Thyme leaves have become difficult to obtain in stores in this area.  I'd only been able to find the McCormick ""gourmet"" thyme leaves at almost $4 for a small bottle. The quality of these leaves is every bit as good as the ""gourmet"" leaves and the price is considerably less."
Good Salt of the Earth,"This is truly amazing salt... if you're a salt-a-holic like me, you'll appreciate it's amazing saltiness, but also it's delicate infusion of flavor-enhancing, depth-increasing grace... I've never imagined a ""graceful"" salt, but this is it!  The smoked flavored salt is delightful... although it's very subtle, and I like a more intense flavor of smoke, so I'd take a Salish over this this, but it's a great combo for salt tasters... Worth the price - cheeper than your corner gourmet store, if they had it, which they won't, so don't feel bad about not supporting your local businesses because they most likely won't carry this!"
95% bananas & only 5% strawberries,It's delicious as expected but don't expect to see much of the strawberry.  It is mainly banana.  I know that it's random where one package may have more strawberry than others but still the ratio is not anywhere near 50/50. For every 10 pieces of bananas you will find about 2 pieces of strawberries.
Dogswell Happy Hips - Treats,"My dog loves these treats and I have been buying them from Target. Found them @ Amazon in bulk and for a much lower per pack price. I got my father's dog hooked on these, too. Now he buys them from Amazon!"
Yum,"This is our favorite tomato product: works great in sauces.  Unlike other reviewers, I had no problems with the packaging or dented cans. The 6-pack was well packed in multiple layers of bubble wrap."
Ridiculous Price,"This item is way over priced.  Don't pay $1 / cup.  You can get it around $0.60 / cup anywhere else online.  If you are paying $1 / cup, you might as well go to Dunkin Donuts."
Grrrr...,I'm eating a box of these Nabisco Animal Crackers right now.  The cookies are almost like graham crackers but leave a funny aftertaste in your mouth.  I would not get this again.  Time to go find some milk...
Horrible,"I had already bought this product from another website before and I generally love it. However, the one I bought from this supplier tasted horrible and it also tasted like someone dropped ashes in it.  This comes with 12 packages and I opened 3 to make sure that it was not just a problem with the one package. Because this was so horrible, I could not bring myself to try the rest so the rest of it will be going into the garbage."
Our Favorite,"Green Mountain is our favorite coffee.  We switched from grinding our own to K cups recently.  We still love Vermont Country Blend and Heifer Hope, but this is the ultimate K-cup for us.  A medium roast, rich but not bitter.  It satisfies every time."
Disappointed with freshness,These candy bars were not very fresh. Of course they are Wunderbars and still taste pretty good! They end up costing quite a bit which would be fine if they were fresh!
Sweet but Strong,"The vanilla in this coffee is a prominent flavor.<br />It's a bold tasting coffee sweetened by the natural, ground vanilla beans.<br />I am really not a coffee drinker, but I do like a cup now and then in the cold weather especially and I lie that this coffee is an organic and naturally flavored coffee.<br />It tastes very good and I think anyone who likes vanilla will really enjoy the flavor of this coffee.<br />It is a treat."
good taste - not the overload that most energy drinks have,"Unlike other reviewers here, I happened to like the flavor of the Acai Pomegranate EBOOST, especially compared to other energy supplements. Frankly, my experience with other supplements often leaves me nauseous, but not with the EBOOST.<br /><br />You still get the intensity, which I found more acceptable with a larger (16oz) glass of water. For my purposes, though, I'm not sure I could take this on a daily basis."
Brach's Candy Corn doesn't taste the same...,"The candy corn had many imperfections, was grainier, poorer appearance and just not the same.  As a candy corn officiando, I was taken aback by the foreign black spots found in the candy.  Then I looked at the bag to see where it was made and learned it is now made in Mexico.  So I went on a search for American made candy corn, which I found, so no more Brach's candy corn for this family."
Favorite bread ever,"This has been my favorite bread since I was a kid. I've tried many others. It's still the best. A little sweet but not too much, excellent flavor, and a nice firm softness to it. I guess it's a little healthy too, although I'm sure there are healthier breads, but this bread is just too easy to eat, I can't give it up. It's especially good for sandwiches, and eggs-on-toast. It makes good french toast too.<br /><br />What a price though!!! Don't buy it here online, it's a normal bread price at the store."
Wonderful!,More than I expected.  I received item quickly and it was wonderful.<br />I am very happy with it all.
Treats for the holidays!,These mini cheesecakes are scrumptious and a great addition for your guests who require a gluten free dessert - with the mini sampler size you can offer multiple flavor choices and they are all so tasty!
Good cookie,"This shortbread is a little less moist than I like, but the taste is good. There is no artifical sugar aftertaste. They are a reasonable substitute for those with such diet restrictions."
Just Okay - Hidden Decaf.,Taste is okay.  Not blown away.  Hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee.  Only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box.  Not what I want first thing in the morning.
Yummy!,This is the best syrup we've tried so far and we will be buying it again.
Even my Beagle can't break this toy.,"I am so happy I found this product! Charlie can break through almost any toy but not this one. I was very surprised by how thick the ""jug"" is (I purchased the large.) He loves chewing on the rope which is rubber and so far it has not been broken. The dry food I put inside comes out in the right amount, it doesn't fall out like some toys and it is not to difficult like others. I am very very happy and recommend this toy to anyone with a dog that likes to chew and needs to be kept busy."
Amazing,This chai tea is absolutely delicious. Very creamy and full of flavor. I mix it with the Starbucks Sumatra coffee for a tasty drink.  Buy it - you won't regret it!!
If youre looking for taste this is not it,"If you want an energy drink that tastes good this is not it. This stuff tastes like detergent with bleach flavor, and has the unpleasant aftertaste of artificial sweeteners. However it has the highest caffeine content per can of any other energy drink ive seen, and it surely gets the job done if you need to stay awake after a night of no sleep. Also, it is cheaper per volume then other energy drinks."
wrong flavor,"i ordered mint chocolate and got supreme. i am very unhappy, becouse you cant return it.."
amazing,"I used these for the first time this summer hiking the Grand Canyon and other places out west, we took down bottled sport drink and these tablets to save weight. At home I tried them and thought they taste like watered down grape jello, but not bad. On the trip I was amazed, sports drinks got hot and tasted gross and sticky, made you feel bloated yet still thirsty. These little tabs cover the taste of water, didn't make your mouth feel gross and you could feel the pick up it gave you. Completely satisfied with the product and willing to try other flavors. It was easy to use, pop them in your bottle and they fizz away, a quick shake and your ready to go. Don't pop them in your mouth, as a buddy of mine did thinking thats how you used them, he gagged his way through for quite a while, I still laugh at the memory."
Yum,This is an excellent and bold decaf.  The flavor really reminds me of Cafe du Monde's coffee in New Orleans' French Marketplace!  It also tastes very nice and bold on the 12 oz. cup Keurig setting!
Cheese Crocks,The cheeses were wonderful!  My family enjoyed the variety.  Having the cheese in a crock container ensures freshness till the cheese is gone.
Just average,"First time buyer of these 5 pound bags of coffee. I really like Italian Roast Coffee from 'you know who' and was hoping this would at least be close enough to switch to. Unfortunately it's average at best. No better than Eight O'clock Italian Roast Coffee which I can get at my local grocery. It's flavor seems dull and/or muddy, not at all what I like in my coffee. But it was a good try and many will like it I suppose. All is not lost as I donated the 4+ lbs of the bag to a school employees lounge that I know. I MAY try another from this roaster but I'm not sure."
This stuff kicks A**,"I love this gum and I am sad to see a single, mostly irrelevant review knocking the rating of this gum down near two and a half stars. If you know and love this gum please take the time to rate it."
good but not as pictured,They work very well but they are not as pictured they do not fit the holding base and they lids are all different everything works well they srew to the pump but not as pictured
Packed with Flavor,"These bars blew me away with their chocolate flavor, and my husband liked it when he tried one.  It reminds me of Cocoa Pebbles.  These bars are as nutritious and perfectly moist as the other flavors by EnviroKidz.  Perfect for chocoholics who are also trying to eat healthy."
Not Considered Natural in the Rest of the World,Erythritol is a highly processed sugar alcohol polyol which is considered in Europe as synthetic and is not classed as natural nor organic. These are known as ' fake iols ' in the sweetener business. There are reported problems with eyesight and digestion. Google search erythritol dangers.
Quality Creamer,"This is a bulk case of the same creamer you'd purchase at the store.  Excellent, fresh tasting creamer delivered to your door and at a fraction of what other office supply companies charge.<br /><br />If you have popped containers, blame your mail carrier, not Amazon."
Licorice AND Chocolate...YUM!,"If you like Black Licorice (and is there really any other kind) and chocolate, you will LOVE these.  It's a bit of Heaven!  I've been losing weight this past year, 118 pounds worth, but for Christmas, I will treat myself to one of these.  They are that good, that you can look forward with anticipation for a whole year just to savor one.  Mmmmmmmmmm....."
Delicious and Convenient,I received a sample of this cookie and oh my goodness it didn't let me down.  It was delicious and tastes a lot like a homemade cookie you'd make yourself!  I loved how soft it was as I prefer soft over crunchy cookies.  I'm definitely interested in checking out the different flavors they offer.
Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED,"I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. But I just thought I'd try to give everyone a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying"
All natural and all fun!,"Kind bars are not only all natural but gluten free as well! They are a great tasting snack (can be a meal replacement), that are filling and available in a variety of flavors. And yes - these are made in the US of A. So, you don't have to worry about contamination.<br /><br />I have a personal preference against peanuts and unfortunately that limits your selection but there are still quite a few options. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is my favorite since it not only is all healthy nuts (no peanuts!) but also includes a vegetarian source of Omega 3 - flax seeds.<br /><br />Our four year old loves these bars as well and that makes these truly special (as part of what I can assure you is a very small list of healthy foods!) Amazon's price on these is the best!"
Works great,The product is exactly as pictured. I have had no problems so far and have enjoyed the convenience very much.
Bad Price,"Unlike most other things we've found on Amazon, the price of this formula is terrible.  Diapers.com and Babies R Us offer much better pricing on this item, by almost $10 in some cases."
Good Flavor and Smooth,"An enjoyable tea. I have only tried it hot; not iced, so I don't know how it is cold. It is smooth and has a nice fruity blend of strawberry, raspberry and acai."
"pretty good, could be better",Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.
Best ever for bred machine,I have tried different product and even my own but did not have the good results I have had with this mix. We enjoy the texture of this bread.
Jelly Belly Knows Flavor,"We recently bought a snow cone machine for my daughter.  I wanted to join in the fun, but I have been on a low-carb diet for almost 2 years.  I noticed there were a number of manufacturers making sugar-free snow cone syrups, but I chose Jelly Belly because I assumed that they would make a great-tasting syrup.  I was not dissappointed.  This one tasted as good as I have ever tasted a sugar-free product.  I have since ordered several other of their sugar-free flavors.  Thank you Jelly Belly."
My cat loves it!,"I got my Prowl three days ago (thanks for the fast shipping Amazon!) and tried it out on my one year old half siamese girl kitty.  When I made it up, I noticed it had a strong roasted chicken smell and my girl must have smelled it too since she came running into the kitchen and meowing for it.  After waiting the five minutes for it to rehydrate, it was still a little soupy, but she didn't mind.  She ate it all at once and licked the bowl clean.  This is unusual since she usually takes her time finishing her meals.  After reading the reviews, I followed the suggestion of making it up ahead of time and refrigerating it overnight so it gets more solid.  So the next morning, when I gave her the more solid form of Prowl, she finished it all at one sitting and licked the bowl clean.  It must taste wonderful since she even ate the dehydrated Prowl I accidentally dropped on the floor.  Bottom line for my kitty, she'll eat the Prowl in any form, dry, soupy or solid.  She gives it a four paws up!"
Tasty Olive Oil,I order this oil via subscribe and save - I chose it because of the convenient size and because it is organic. It has a slightly bitter/sharp flavor that makes it too strong for some applications but I use it for all my salad dressings and cooking and have not looked around for any other for many months.
Just OK coffee.,"The coffee is just OK. It's very mild, almost bordering on weak. Would buy it again if the price was right."
Excellent,I ordered this product online because it's small and can easily fit into my backpack.  I use it as a substitute when I go out and there's no artificial sweetner substitute either in restaurants or when I go to friends' places.<br /><br />This product is very handy to have in those times as I have diabetes and I have to be careful about my blood sugar.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it highly.
Very Good,"This is a great tasting coffee. Not only good first thing in the morning, but anytime. Very smooth. Green Mountain puts out great tasting coffee on all flavors and blends"
Healthy and Tasty,"Hemp protein is a low glycemic alternative to whey and soy.  These bars lack nothing in the taste department, and are a good snack or meal replacement."
My dogs gobbled it up,"I wish the ingredients were a little healthier because my two mini dachshunds really love this food. I should have read the ingredients first. The soy ingredients don't bother me as much as the food coloring does. (Added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color).  The green peas and vegetables in the mix aren't really veggies, but a kibble formed into vegetable shapes and colored to look like vegetables. I wish pet food manufacturers would spend less on making dog food look appetizing to humans and more in making it healthy for our pets.<br /><br />Although beef is the first ingredient on the list, most of the rest are grain products including soy, corn and rice. One of our dogs sometimes has a sensitive stomach and it's probably all the soy that doesn't always agree. Another ingredient is animal digest which could contain goodness knows what. I think I prefer the limited ingredient types of foods that my dogs normally eat, ones where I can recognize all the ingredients and they don't sound like something I wouldn't want to eat."
Great for the price,"I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of ""Old Maid"" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $."
no customer service,"The product was ok. I like that it has no dairy, as I was unable to find any that my son, who has a dairy allergy, could have. I ordered 2 vanilla boxes and 2 maple boxs. The vanilla arrived fine, but both maple boxs came broken. I did not feel comfter able giving my babies broken pices. I emailed the company twince to see if they would replace them and I have not heard anything. i also tried to call them, but their coustomer service number doesnt work. I WILL NOT be buying anything from this company again!!"
"excellent decaf, wacky price fluctuation",This decaf is great.<br /><br />I paid $29+ for the 2 boxes last time and now it is $10 more at $39+ I just found that I can buy from green mountain's website for $28 if I start a subscription in their cafe express. You have to buy 4 boxes of coffee but I always do anyway. I buy 2 decaf and 2 regular.
"Great Dog Food, Reasonably Priced","We been feeding our dogs Beneful dog food for years and have been very pleased.  We've tried others but always keep coming back to this brand.  I think the quality is very good and the product is priced well.  I've never been convinced that the expensive ""premium"" brands are really that much better. I'm not aware of any studies that demonstrate that they are better. Our dog really likes this brand.  Although we keep our dog food in a large plastic container, I do appreciate the fact that this comes with  ""ZIP LOCK"" type zipper on the bag.  Overall I am very pleased and can recommend this product."
Smart fries smart idea!,I love smart fries and can't believe the nutritional difference between them and regular chips! I only wish there was a little more seasoning to increase the flavor slightly.  The jalape&ntilde;o is my favorite late night snack!
healthy snack,"Good;, healthy snack for those parents seeking alternatives for the junk food their kids think they want."
Weak coffee,I was very disappointed in this coffee pod. The first few that I tried broke open during the brewing process and got grounds all over. The coffee is not a very bold or strong flavored coffee. Won't purchase this item again.
Chocolate covered Oreo recipe,"Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation."
Fabulous Cookie!,"Recently I was forced to bypass the airport food court because of a series<br /><br />of gate changes.  I finally sat down on my Delta flight exhausted<br /><br />and starving.  Once we were airborn, disappointment was still with<br /><br />me as I thought my lot would be pretzels and bad coffee.  But, soon<br /><br />I was eating these wonderfully delicious cookies and wanting more.<br /><br />I even saved the wrapper (sadly losing it later) hoping I could buy them<br /><br />elsewhere.<br /><br />Voila!  I found them, and they are fantastic. . . ."
Tastes like coconut water from a fresh coconut stored in a plastic jug in the trunk of your car for a few days!,"I've spent at least a hundred bucks on the old Zico boxes.  Those were metal lined, the juice was not from concentrate.  I just got a shipment of the new bottles, took a swig and almost spit it out.  Tastes like plastic.  I gave it a few more swigs, and now my stomach hurts.<br /><br />I immediately logged into Amazon so I could warn others not to buy this crap.  I'm closing the bottle, putting it back in the box and sending it all back to Amazon.  I will never buy Zico again.  YUCK!"
Better than Goldfish,"These cheddar bunnies are perfect snacks for kids who love Goldfish.  They aren't as greasy or salty, and don't have that artificial cheese taste.  Definitely recommended."
Incredible Cookie,"This is a delightful blend of ginger and lemon in a crisp ginger English tea cookie with a lemon creme filling.  Reading the list of all natural ingredients tells you why there is no additive after taste.  They are made in Canada for Carr's of Canada.  As with any number of previously purchased items, it becomes increasingly difficult to find locally.  Once again Amazon comes through to help satisfy our cravings."
One of my year-round faves,"Usually, this tea is only available in stores during October and November. But I like it all year long. It's got a rich, spicy taste and tastes like pumpkin pie when you add a milk product and a sweetener.<br /><br />I'm also glad that the order is for six boxes, so I don't have to ration myself."
Care bears Capsule,"Size of the care bear is bigger than expected. Quality is ok for the price. It didnt come in a box as shown in picture, just packed in a plastic bag. In fact, there are many other exact same products on Amazon. I bought another set from another seller at a much lower price as I thought they are different as the dimensions given are different. But turned out to be the same size and same quality."
Too weak to work- disappointing,"I'm a tea drinker, not a coffee drinker but I find these little tins make a nice change and a peppermint  coffee sounds good for the holidays. Unfortunately the delivery didn't live up to the promise.<br /><br />It smells wonderful. A Christmassy peppermint smell with a thick froth of foam on top. Sitting on a table top perfuming the air it's like a commercial for Christmas. The problem is that the flavor is too weak. After all the promise it just sort of falls flat. I tried to make it with more powder, same effect. It looks and smells wonderful but in the end it just disappoints. Not really worth the money."
happy,I have always loved this dressing. We moved and now i have to get it online. This was the best price as I only  wanted two. Arrived fast and early.
Great snack for young children...,I was introduced to Pirate's Booty with the aged white cheese a few years ago when my eldest was about 1year.  It's the perfect treat to give young kids when you're enjoying popcorn.  No kernals which means no worry about chocking.  Plus it's a healthy snack for the young and the old.  My girls enjoy it so much that I actually have the 10 oz bags shipped from Arizona since I can't find them at our new station.<br />Enjoy.
Rotten and covered in mold,"I decided that i should first research how to germinate acorns, they said you should soak them in hot water for 24 hours. I did. None of the seeds sunk, I know that it is not a completely reliable method to prove the viability of the seeds, but still! out of the 10 acorns that I bought, none sunk! They floated like dead fish. So I decided to open with a hammer 3 acorns to check their appearance. 2 out of the 3 were completely rotten with mold covering their entire surface. I would definitively not buy these seeds again! However, I have bought several species in excellent condition from this seller, that germinated."
Made my yorkie sick,"My yorkie ate this dog chew and the next morning she threw up all of the pieces.  Didn't want to eat all day and was sick.  No more of these for her.  Not worth the risk if it were to get stuck in her intestines.  Not worth making her sick.  Would rate ""O"" stars if I could.  These are awful.... not for small dogs at all!!! Great that they are made in the USA but they are not good for small dogs."
Excellent stuff,"This product contained no artificial thickeners, such as carrageenan, no msg type ingredients such as casein and no fructose or cane sugar. The sweeteners it did contain were the very best, inulin, which is actually a prebiotic, and some stevia.<br />I will definitely be ordering more."
Makes a good cup of decaf,"Sometimes I want a coffee but not the caffeine.<br />Decided to try a box of these cups and was pleasantly rewarded.  Some reviews are too light, some are too string.  I find the ""standard"" Keurig poor is just right for me with about one tablespoon of regular Coffee Mate powder.  Enough body to be flavorful without overpowering."
Pretty decent cup,"Not your gourmet cup of coffee, but a decent, strong, satisfying cup.  My last purchase was the Coffee People Donut Shop- if you like that one, this is similar, but a little stronger.  The reason I switched from Donut Shop was bc the flavor was very weak. This one is definitely a step up, however there is definitely more bitterness to it so it's not as tasty as some others. I am still looking for that strong, flavorful cup... haven't found it yet, but at least Jet Fuel will buy me some time to find it!"
"Great value, would love auto ship",With the free shipping this is a much better value than purchasing them at the store.  My son loves them so I bought him a case for his birthday.  Just wish they have auto ship on this item.
Angel hair is my favorite,"The other reviews got it right! This pasta is delicious, tastes like regular pasta, and I never get tired of it. Angel hair is my favorite. I cook it a few minutes longer than the recommended 5 so it's softer. Then I mix in butter, basil, and a little milk for sauce. I could literally eat that everyday. Yum!"
Dries Out,"I ordered this product with high hopes, but when I got it, all the brown sugar was very dried out.  Even though I rehydrated it according to the directions on the bag, it just dried out again.  Storing it double bagged did not help either."
Extra Ginger Flavored,"Newman's Own Organic Ginger Snaps are loaded with ginger.  Both candied and ground ginger give these small hard cookies a real kick.  Taste is a mixture of wheat flower, sugar and molasses.  The ginger kick arrives late and mostly as an after taste.  For someone who likes ginger, this is a good thing.  Children may find this too overpowering and not care for these.  Nice to have on hand for a late night snack with a cold glass of milk for dunking."
Great Value,I was shocked at the size of the box. 2 Huge bags.<br />Fresh and it will last a long time .
Still Taste Great,"I had eaten Slim Jim's for years. After a decade of abstinence from this delicious treat I decided to order these and they still taste great. Since so many talked about the count of Slim Jim's, I actually counted them. The box I counted had 108 with 3 of these just being sealed empty packaging. I will buy these again."
FLAVOR DOES NOT EQUAL THE CLEVER IDEA,"I really do like  being able to customize how strongly favored a drink is, and I like the handiness of the packaging- the concentration keeps the package size small and portable. However,  as a frequent drinker of diet tea beverages I am disappointed in the taste. I don't expect it to taste real- either the tea  or the sweetener-but this beverage just tastes, well, TOO artificial. I tried various amounts in the same amount of water and never got it to taste good. It's not so bad that I won't<br />finish the package, but not so good that I'm likely to buy it."
Good for dieting,"I am giving up candy and sweets for one month and then going to continue best I can.  I am loving this as an alternative.  It has the hard candy shell which I really need right now. Is a more firm gum so it won't stick.  If you like the really soft gums, then this is not for you. Since I am using it for weight loss I like that I have to chew a bit. Perfect cinnamon bite.  Not too hot, but has that little bite.  Average lasting in flavor.<br />Great for travel."
Not your usual cola.,"If you're used to that cola from Atlanta or in the red white and blue can from New York, you're probably going to be disappointed with the taste.<br /><br />But is it an acceptable cola as colas go? Yes. I'd even say as a mixer, it'd be fine. There is a heavy aftertaste of carmelized sugar, and that does impact the taste of the cola itself but it is drinkable even if the folks used to Atlanta's finest despise it. Muddy it up with something like flavored syrup (cherry, vanilla, etc) or Rum and it isn't as noticeable.<br /><br />Also remember that with cola and other ""dark"" syrups, you have to increase the level of carbonation. I typically do 4-5 buzzes for the right amount of fizz.<br /><br />I'd put it above the tea taste of the Natural root beer as it's drinkable but still below the lemon/lime and Ginger Ale Natural flavors."
very pleased with the service,i received my order in no time at all! also all the seeds germinated and now i have very nice plants in my garden
Clever Way to Hide MSG,"dried autolyzed yeast extract = MSG<br /><br />If you want to find out if there is processed free glutamic acid (MSG) in a product, you must ask the manufacturer for information about ""free glutamic acid.""  Don't ask about ""MSG.""  Manufacturers find it convenient, when speaking to consumers, to tell them that there is no ""MSG"" in their product, meaning that there is no ingredient called ""monosodium glutamate.""  Even if a manufacturer tells you there is no MSG in a product, there may be autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed pea protein, carrageenan, sodium caseinate, enzymes, and a whole slew of other ingredients that contain or create processed free glutamic acid (MSG) during manufacture.<br /><br />If you are told that all of the MSG in a product is ""naturally occurring,"" thank the manufacturer for that meaningless information, but explain that all processed free glutamic acid (MSG) is referred to as ""natural"" by the FDA -- so ""natural"" tells you nothing.  In fact, as the word ""natural"" is defined by the FDA, the food ingredient ""monosodium glutamate"" is ""natural.""<br /><br />It is the amount of processed free glutamic acid in the product that will determine whether or not you might suffer an MSG reaction. (Everyone has a different tolerance for MSG.) If the manufacturer claims not to know whether or not there is processed free glutamic acid (MSG) in his or her product, ask that the product be analyzed for free amino acids, including free glutamic acid. There are tests for measuring free glutamic acid. The AOAC Official Methods of Analysis (1984) gives one method. There are others. The cost of testing should be no more than $150.<br /><br />We have been advised by the FDA that if any such misbranded products are brought to their attention, they will act to correct the situation. To report misbranded products to the FDA, please call the FDA at 888-723-3366 between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., eastern time - and keep a record of your call."
I love this product,Everyone should have a pack of this in their pantry. It gives all your foods that slow cooked flavor we all love. I am so in love with it. I use it all the time.
Good dog food,"My dog didn't seem to like it at first but seems to be fine with it now. Ingredients look right and price isn't horrible. I will probably go back to a different dog food when this is gone, but that's just because of my dog's preference."
My Favorite In The Mocktail Line,"This is definitely my favorite new drink mix in the Mocktail line by Crystal Light.  It's a great tasting lime flavored drink.  The artificial sweetener gives this a very slight aftertaste, but just slight.  And I like the fact that it is only 5 calories per serving.  Each pouch makes enough to fill a large pitcher.  There isn't any type of alcohol flavor, which is fine with me.  It's a very refreshing drink.  I can drink this stuff all day!"
Fantastic chips! The best ever!,Seriously the best tortilla chips - or chips of any kind I have ever had.  Plus they have the added benefit of being nutritious.  Highly recommend them plain or with salsa & cheese!
great sauce maker,"i add two packages to my crock pot for stews and pot roasts, it adds nice flavor and thickens into a nice gravy, been using for years and super market was outrageous at 2.99 each."
Can't Have Coffee,That's right I cannot have coffee without my Torani Syrup.  And thank you Amazon for making so easy and quick to obtain.  I have ordered this item before and will again and again.  Thank You Amazon!!
"Wonderful, Excellent, LOVED by my very finicky spoiled boy!","I have a Coton De Tulear (very rare breed). He's got attitude and is incredibly spoiled. He doesn't eat dog food. I cook for him every night. He does however like a few (very few) dog treats. I recently bought him the Pure Bites Cheddar Cheese, because he LOVES cheese. This dog treat is a homerun. My very finicky boy LOVES this treat. ALOT!!! I recommend it highly!"
Awesome Rawhide Treat!,"I don't get how some people say the rawhide does not last? I have a BIG Black Lab who can chew up a store bought 2 foot rawhide in less than an hour. That being said this one has lasted a week now. I am so pleased with this product that this is our 8th purchase of the different styles offered. Our furry baby just loves them. A PLUS to this product, it is not only good for his hips and joints, but he digests this one easily. Unlike the cheap store bought ones he has choked up and has gotten sick from. We have no complaints about this rawhide at all. Just wish they came even bigger. Best rawhide we have ever bought and we will not go back to the store bought ones now."
great taste,I do Bikram Yoga almost every day and this is by far the best rehydrating drink I have had. It's so refreshing and one of these after class cures my thirst.
Great Sports Bottle,This sports bottle great for my kids. They loved to carry every place on a hot summer day. It is light weight and doesn't taste like plastic.
Like a fresh cappucino put in a can - nice flavor but texture is lacking,"The illy cappucino has a nice unsweetened flavor.  Of course, the challenge is having the texture of a cappucino in a can, and that challenge has not been mastered.  The texture is a little thin and flat.  The instructions say not to shake the can, which I would have though to help.  Overall, it's a fine substitute for convenience."
Did I pay for sugar and water?,This is a poor excuse for lychee product. It is water with sugar and a very faint lychee flavor. You can do better with any brand lychee honey (syrup) from a supermarket in Chinatown<br />which has 20 times the lychee flavor. I ended up throwing the 4 bottles away after a sip.
mona lisa,This was a big disappointment. There was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this. The color is green and not very appealing to look at. However it does work as a great antioxidant.
HANDY SIZE,"I love Spry gum. It doesn't taste too strong, it doesn't stick to dental work, and it supposedly is good for your teeth.  You can get a giant jar and refill this little container for your car or purse."
great for my little one,"I got these for my toddler as she LOVES ranch dressing.  I was tired of paying .50 -.75 at a restaurant just to get a side of ranch so I just carry a few of these in my purse and can have one ready for her no matter what she is eating and not be charged an arm and a leg for her ""dipping sauce"""
"OK, but...","This might be an excellent cereal, but the boxes that I bought had large pieces stuck together that were hard as a rock and dangerous to the fillings in your teeth.  They can be manually broken apart, but that is a lot of extra trouble.  Other than that, the flavor is good.  It does have a significant amount of fiber, and a reasonable amount of protein.  There is a potential problem with sodium deficiency if you eat too many foods low in sodium (that can cause muscle cramps, especially in your legs)."
Best Licorice Ever!,"I was given a sample of this licorice from a friend who bought it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  With so many of the standard brands having little flavor, this was an immediate standout.  I have only tried the strawberry flavor, but it has a rich taste, and is a ""soft"" but still good and chewy licorice.  I love it.  When it wasn't available at Bed Bath, and Beyond, I found it on Amazon, and of course, it is considerably less expensive.  The only downside is that you must buy 12 6 ounce packages at once.  For me, that's not really a problem."
top notch,this is a fine example of mineral-rich himalayan salt. The packaging also keeps it fresh. It comes in a zip-seal pouch.
"Tart, Deep, Flavorful Tea with Hibiscus Flowers","****<br />Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, juicy, red fruits"".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as other teas such as Numi, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.<br />****"
Fruity Tea,"I have been drinking tea for about 50 years or so, and Stash makes a great-tasting full-bodied tea.  This tea has a smooth fruity taste (peach).  It is not overbearing, but a nice subtle peachiness.<br /><br />Individually sealed in a paper/foil pouch for added freshness, this tea is listed as having 100 % natural ingredients.  They are, in the order listed, wuyi oolong tea<br />orange peel, lemongrass, and white peach flavor.<br /><br />It has been said that oolong tea was named after the part of Wuyi mountain, in China, where it was originally produced. It is among the most popular types of teas served in typical Chinese restaurants. (I have also found Jasmine tea and varieties of green tea in typical Chinese restaurants&iexcl;Xand plum wine.  Yum.)<br /><br />It is also suggested that oolong tea is useful for weight loss.  In my (non-medical) opinion (I am not a doctor), like anything else, it can HELP but won&iexcl;¦t carry the load.  Oolong appears to be a diuretic, helping you to loose excess water.  If you lose too much water, you might dehydrate or lose valuable potassium.  So, I suggest that you limit yourself to 24 oz a day.  As with anything else, seek guidance from your health care practitioner.<br /><br />I suggest adding agave cactus juice, unbleached natural brown sugar, or honey, if you want a sweetener.  I like fruity teas often in the evening, and instead of dessert.<br /><br />Darn it!  Now I&iexcl;¦m craving Chinese food and am snowed in--in a blizzard&iexcl;Xwith over 40 inches of snow on the ground.  I wonder if they will deliver? º"
"Easy, quick, and great tasting capsules","I bought the Dolce Gusto machine in 2008, and have been an avid fan of the machine and the capsules ever since.<br />While I do have a couple pointers (not quite complaints, but advice to make your Dolce Gusto experience better) that pertain to the machine itself -- and thus the final coffee product -- I feel the capsules themselves are not at fault for any of the machine's problems.<br />After many days of getting used to the machine, I've found that loosely following the recommended milliliter measurements  on the boxes is a good start, and from there it's up to you. Personally, I do just the recommended amount of milk and then pour the espresso until I see the tiniest hint of transparency in the flow. From there I wait anywhere from half a minute to a few minutes (the longer you wait, the more espresso left in the capsule makes it's way to the bottom ready to get the last flush of hot water...but at the same time, the more the foam melts into the coffee), depending on what other busy morning activities I've gotten myself into while preparing the drink, and then push another few seconds worth of espresso out of the capsule. Does this make a world of difference in strength? I doubt it...but it gives me just that much darker of a drink and it makes me feel like I'm getting the most bang for my buck.<br />Ofcourse, the fact that I can get that much more espresso out of the capsule by waiting a bit isn't necessarily all the capsule's fault, but it is truly my only caveat (I also wonder if it's possible to make recyclable capsules...). Either way, unless I've really overdone the amounts of milk or espresso (or haven't gotten back to the machine in time to turn it off), getting a 'watered-down' cappuccino is not possible and, in my opinion, purely an 'operator problem' (see tip above).<br />Also something to note: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee and the final product shouldn't be any more than 35mL. The instructions on the package tell you to pour about 40mL (and there is exactly 8g of espresso in the capsule). In other words, if you overdo the espresso capsule, you'll be getting a noticeably watered down espresso (as for the whole cappuccino, I usually can't tell if I've overdone it a touch).<br />Guests have always commented on the excellent look (use clear glasses for quite the show), feel, and taste of the foam and milk. I have to agree that compared to using other capsule-based machines where one has to purchase an extra milk-frother (and deal with the clean-up, supplies, etc), this system easily produces a comparable (at least) milk and foam experience, with very little hassle (if any).<br /><br />When it comes to flavors, there's been a long-standing tie between Cappuccino and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O"">Latte Macchiato</a> in my household. We tend to always have a supply of Cappuccino around with the occasional box of Macchiatto every month or two. Cappuccino is definitely a favorite. Top notch. Never had a problem with a bad after-taste, or at least nothing but the great taste of good espresso.<br />For those who like to know where their coffee comes from: the milk is from France and the coffee capsules are from England (although the actual 100% ground and roasted arabica beans themselves, I don't know). Also, there's 8g of ground coffee in the espresso capsules (the Latte Macchiato has less -- in fact, the Macchiato box recommends 50mL of espresso for a capsule that contains 6.5g...in other words, the amount of espresso that you'd find in a fairly small single shot with the amount of water reserved for a small double shot...perhaps one of the reasons I tend to prefer the Cappuccino).<br /><br />And ofcourse, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the subscribe and save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through subscribe and save), AND factoring in the 10 award points you get with every box (with which you can redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 7 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br />And since I'm a money-saving statistics addict, I'm especially happy about the fact that the online rewards program keeps track of all the points you've ever recorded (thus telling me how many boxes I've ever purchased). This helps me calc. how much money I've saved in total in comparison to, say, Starbucks.<br />All in all, if you're not quite willing to shell out major bucks for a real espresso machine, and have limited counter-space to begin with, the Dolce Gusto machine is an easy choice (they just released new and improved versions, too). **And, as of early October '10, they've revamped their boxes, giving them a classier, more matte-like finish (along with a recycle symbol on the bottom) and a cleaner look in terms of pictures and text. Great improvement to the design, and a fun, refreshing face-lift.**<br /><br />In terms of capsules, the Cappuccino is a solid choice -- a staple in my cabinet."
Disappointed,"I really love these nuts and have been eating them for the past twenty five years.  This was my first experience receiving old nuts which were far below the standard I have come to expect.  Instead of a nice white they were brown.  They were not as flavorfull as in the past and I suspect they were just starting to go bad.  The flavoring was clumped instead of being evenly distributed on the nut.  They left a bad taste in my mouth.  I thought I would get a box of six as I have received in the past, but instead, I received six individual cans which were repackaged in plastic.  There were no expiration dates since they were repackaged.  It makes me wonder if they were repackaged because they had expired.  I'm truly disappointed."
Good Food,Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.  I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.
Good coffee,"Most of the reviews I have read were pretty much how the coffee tasted to people. Since everyone's taste is different, I think it's a moot point. What is important is how fresh the coffee is. I found that each cup had the same freshness so that's a nod to consistency. As for my own personal taste preferences, I drank Folgers Classic Roast for years and since that isn't available in K cup, I've been drinking the Caribou Coffee blend as a replacement. It tastes fine to me and the caffeine keeps me going all day.  I haven't had any problems with using the Caribou Coffee K cup either. When company comes, this is one coffee I don't share :)"
has a very good flavor,"strawberry twist has a long-lasting pleasant flavor SWEET-but, not excessively so. delivery is timely and price is just right. Supieror to other TRIDENT flavors! Though, SPEARMINT isn't bad either. My next pick would be blueberry"
Better than OREO's,"I decided to start an organic diet. I started with Newman's cookies.  Amazon had a sale, and I decided to give County Choice a chance.<br />I am SOOOOOOOOO glad I did.  I love them.  They are better than OREO's."
Corn isn't dog food.,"Canidae has been excellent for my dogs. My Siberian can be picky at times but they all seem to like Canidae. The company was open and informative with me.(1.800.398.1600) I'll not be feeding my dogs ANYTHING that comes out of China unless we go flat broke. Many foods(pet & people) say ""Made in America"" but most of the ingredients are from foreign countries and the food is only pressed together and packaged here. I consider this dishonest and immoral. It's also obviously legal thanks to federal policy that favors 'Free-trade/profit' over the health of American children, much less their pets. A premium food, sans fillers and trash, really is no more expensive since you feed less of it. Your dog will be healthier. Call this company and other companies and ask about their ingredients. Science diet and Purina will, for good reason, be way more evasive than Canidae."
Addictive!,No need to cook them. They are best right out of the can dipped in big frank juice!  I have been eating these for at least 30 years.  Whenever we get a can in the house it's a big deal as they are so hard to find these days.  The kids and I try to limit ourselves to 2 franks a day and even that is difficult.  My husband won't eat them as he thinks they smell like dog food.  I can see how someone who isn't accustomed to the taste might not like these.  You either love or hate these.
I can have peanut butter again!,"This stuff sounded too good to be true, but I tried it anyhow, and WOW am I glad that I did! I usually eat PB2 as a snack spread on a chocolate Vitatop muffin. I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar. The powder also tends to repel liquids, so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else. Start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture, then add the peanut powder/water mixture to your recipe."
Best low-fat dog food!,My dog had gotten Pancreatitis (no reason why) but had already been eating the regular whitefish Wellness bag so we switched to this low-fat blend b/c Pancreatitis can be caused by too much fat in a dogs diet (make sure you look at the fat content in any brand you buy) and it's working out great!  It's a great blend and brand for the price!
Favorite Childhood Gum,"The gum is great, the flavor is very intense. The only downside to this gum, and the reason for 4 stars, is its juiciness only lasts for about 10 minutes. The flavor remains, but this is definitely a gum thats only worth about 30-60 minutes, and probably why I enjoyed it so much as a kid before spitting it out or sticking it to a desk &lt;.&lt;"
Gross and WAY too Sweet,"Milk is almost a requirement.  All I pretty much taste is the sweetner.  It barely tastes like coffee.  It tastes weird and like syrup. The packages are sort of annoying because they only tear like 1/3 the way through.  So, unless you don't mind waiting a minute for the stuff to pour out of that small opening you either need to tear it with your teeth or use scissors."
Really Great and a good price,"The other review on this is harsh and incorrect.  This honey is really great, I've bought it twice.  What the other reviewer fails to mention is that in the US the regulations are different and UMF if not a designation recognized by the FDA so it is not required on the packaging. You usually find it on bottles actually imported from New Zealand so if you really want to pay extra for that then go for it. However to call someone a fraud when their company has been in business for so long is rude. If you don't like the honey well then...don't buy it.<br /><br />Their customer service has been great, the only issue I had is that one of the glass bottles I purchased broke in the mail and I left a message which was promptly responded to and a replacement bottle was sent right away with many sincere apologies. I have more trust in a company that has been around for so long and has great Amazon reviews over someone who is adamant about designations, but relies on his sense of 'taste' to evaluate what he is complaining the company isn't evaluating scientifically.<br /><br />This honey is great tasting and worth it!"
I Told You Not To Call Me That At Work.,"Let's cut to the chase.  This is Kellogg's Nut & Honey Crunch dressed in a new box.<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />It tastes good (dry or covered in milk).<br />It stays pretty crunchy down to the last bite.<br />It smells honey nutty.<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />It leaves an aftertaste in your mouth.<br />It's not a healthy cereal.<br /><br />The first 6 ingredients go like this: Milled Corn, Sugar, Peanuts, Honey, Malt Flavoring, Molasses<br /><br />That's a lot of sweetness!  So, I eat it as an after dinner snack/desert.<br /><br />In the end, me and my sweet tooth like it!<br /><br />NOTE: According to the coupon on the side of the box, they are also coming out with ""Roasted Nut & Honey"".  I'm not sure how different that will taste but something to be on the look out for.<br /><br />Search ""80's Nut & Honey Crunch Cereal Commercial"" on YouTube for the reference to my title."
Bitter Brew,"I liked the packaging and the idea behind the company- which was why I decided to try it out- but it's more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The aroma is enticing, but that's where the magic ends.  The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with ""exotic floral and berry beans"" I can't really recommend it too much."
Pets deserve good food too.,"Why didn't I realize sooner that the animals I love deserve food that is wholesome and nutritious?  I recently switched to a top quality dry cat food which I give to our 3 cats daily, but I supplement that with canned ""wet"" food every 2nd or 3rd day.  The cats have adjusted to this new feeding method and really like their new foods.  Newman's Own Organic Chicken and Wild Rice is a fine product and I've ordered it through Amazon's subscription program so that it is sent to me on the interval that works best, and shipping is free.  A very great deal all around."
love the pouch,Easy snack that you can throw into your purse on the way out the door.  My daughter eats them like they are going out of style.  I am so excited to sneak in veggies!
Great Stuff!,"Last summer I was informed by my allergist that I was allergic to coffee. I LOVE coffee, so this was a huge downer for me. I quit drinking coffee and feel much better for it but honestly, tea, hot water and other coffee substitutes just don't have the same satisfying bold taste that coffee does. A friend suggested Teeccino and I thought, ""why not? I've tried everything else."" I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! At first, I drip brewed it in my coffee pot according to the instructions (1 TBSP. per 2 cups water) and it didn't really taste like coffee... kind of but not quite. I have been playing with the mixture and have found that 1 1/2 TSP. per 5 cups of water makes the drink taste EXACTLY like coffee!! Now my mornings are complete again!"
Good Buy,"Better than expected, but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste. This is a good purchase for the price."
great chips but terrible shipping,The chips are awesome.  I first bought them at Costco and now I cannot get them there any more.  The bags at Costco were about 3 times larger than the one I recieved from Amazon.  The arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1/3 full.  I won't waste my money buying them from Amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par.  If you can find the chips retail I would advise buying them that way.  Their website says that super target and Costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently.
LIQUID CHOCOLATE VTIMANS AND MINERALS IS ALWAYS GOOD,IT IS A TYPICAL PURCHASE OF ENSURE. I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE HIGH SHIPPING COST. IT PAYS TO BUY MORE SO IT CAN OFF-SET THE SHIPPING COSTS -- NOT OFF-SET IT -- BUT TO SOMEWHAT JUSTIFY THE PURCHASE OF YOUR ENSURES SOMEWHAT.
Super cute addition to collection!,Every year there is a limited edition M&M holiday dispenser that is cuter than the last.  This year the Nutcracker is just adorable.  A super cute addition to my Christmas decorations . . . I just love him!
"Not green, not good","This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
Tasty!,I purchased this tea based on the reviews here and am glad I did. It's very yummy! I also like to drop a packet into a gourd and mix it up with my yerba mate. The box was sealed in plastic and the tea bags are contained in a large Ziploc bag.
"I like these, plenty of flavor...","I'm sure there's more sodium than I need, but if you don't like the taste you're less likely to eat these and grab something really bad instead. I'll take the trade off and drink more water instead. It's not Doritos, but it's a healthy single serving alternative and a break from less flavorful alternatives..."
great,There is no one anymore that is not low on Magnesium. This is a great product to take before you go to bed. I love that is has Calcium and Potassium right along with it for balance. Helps with night cramps and sleeplessness and heart cramps. It is a must when you take certain medication that will deplete you of Calcium and Potassium!
Awesome,Don't pass this up on baja bobs website.  It is amazing!!! I've tried several items by baja bob and so far they have all been good.
High price but good quality,"Sure you can get them cheaper if you buy them in bulk, but in my house we don't use them a lot. Actually only for spice wine. If we bought a pound of this stuff, we would be throwing out 3/4 of it, if not more. Yes it is expensive, but I got 3 for $29 vice the price at a grocery store of ~$15 a piece (that is if you can even find them)<br />The quality is great, but I give it four stars because even at ~$10 a piece it is still overpriced."
I'm so glad that I came across this honey!,"While searching Amazon for raw honey options, I happened across Ambrosia's Pure Honey.  Since we are a family that consumes a great deal of honey, this item of 4 bottles of 23 oz. raw honey is ideal for us.  I signed up for Subscribe and Save with this honey and the price is too good to be true!  Did I mention that the honey is delicious?"
Adds nicely to a gravy,"I have been taught my Italian family's recipe for ""gravy,"" what I used to call spaghetti sauce. The recipe includes tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, a little wine, garlic, some Italian herbs--and tomato paste. Put it all together and it is a tasy topping for pasta (the family favorite is linguini, but we also use it over tortellini, penne, farfalle, fusilli, and ravioli).<br /><br />The Contadina tomate paste (with Italian herbs) is one of the key components of this gravy."
Fruit Gems,This candy is hard to find other places.  It came on time & in good condition.  The only downside is that shipping costs about as much as the candy itself.
No After Taste!,"When I read that 1 drop equals 1 tsp, I thought, Ok, I'll start with 2 drops in my coffee and then go from there to see how many drops I'll actually need. I put in 2 drops, added my creamer and tasted it. I was amazed!! I didn't need to put any more drops in it. It tastes just like sugar and NO nasty after taste like most of the artificial sweetners. About the only thing I use sugar for is to sweeten my coffee. I just opened my 2nd 2 ounce bottle. The first bottle lasted 5 months. That is NO Exageration!! They state that 1 (2 oz) bottle is equal to 10 lbs of sugar. I have NO doubts about that now. I started using this since I was diagnosed pre-diabetic. Now I'm happy that I found a great substitute to white granular sugar and so is my doctor. I have since ordered more because this is one product I do not want to run out of! Love it!!<br /><br />UPDATE 9/20/12: An added benefit: Since I started using this EZ Sweetz, I haven't used even 1 teaspoon of regular granulated sugar. I also started drinking an 8 oz bottle of Chocolate Flavored Boost Glucose Control. I went to the doctor last week for my 6 month check up and have lost 17 lbs between visits. Since these are the only 2 things I'm doing differently, I attribute the loss to these."
Grove Squares are the Best...,I will order more of this item asap! great stuff. I was hooked the first time that i tried it.
Nescafe Gold Instant Coffee - 3.5oz (100g),We love this kind of instant coffe.we cheched evry retail store but we couldn't find any.i found it online and ordered it.<br />I have no idea how good was the price i paid but i am happy that finally we bought what we wanted.<br />Thanks seller for sending on time.
"Don't bother, you'd get more flavor from pureed lettuce","Some few years ago, I'd use Thai Kitchen sauces and pastes and they tasted pretty good. It's a bit hard here to get lemongrass and other Thai ingredients other than fish sauce. We like Thai food--having traveled extensively in that country and sampled cuisine from north to south.<br /><br />Lately, the pastes and sauces have become absolutely bland, flavorless and nasty. The green curry is no exception. You can pile in the entire contents of this little jar and it will add absolutely no more flavor to a green curry in coconut milk than if you took all the stale lettuce from your vegetable crisper, pureed it into a green mush in your food processor and tried to use it as a curry paste. The result would be about the same.<br /><br />The saddest part of all this is that these products have taken a premier spot on many grocery store shelves and there is no competing brand. I love curry, and even ""good"" cooks will use curry pastes for convenience. (For example, there are Indian curry pastes by Patak that are relatively good, though of course not to the level that a superb cook can create. But they are acceptable.)<br /><br />These are NOT acceptable. If you try to make a green curry out of this, you are wasting time and money."
Instinct Limited Ingredient Dog Food,"I think this dog food is the best on the market. I have three large dogs and have tried different grain free foods and Instinct is the one I trust the most. It's very important to me that its made in the USA. The dogs love it. Their weight stays level, no bad gas or runny stools. Whenever I open a new bag, I sprinkle a handful on the floor and they gobble it up like a treat. Good stuff!"
finally!,"i've searched high and low for a delicious, healthy, meatless jerky product.  i'm a pescatarian, so tuna/salmon/halibut jerky is great, but super expensive and often incredibly high in sodium.  i found these in the aisles of pcc and absolutely fell in love.  first thing i did was search amazon for them, and here they were!  the price is better, and i knew i would eat these every day.  i take two to work and have at least one at home.  i would recommend these to anyone, carnivore or vegan, looking for a delicious, healthy source of protein.  wow!"
"Delectable, Filling Cookies With Low Calories Make a Healthy Snack","These are are crunchy, delectable cookies that come in a variety of flavors, of which, I find The Original & Gingerspice tastier than others - 5 stars. What I find very puzzling is that Amazon has different flavors under Amazon Prime at different times: last week it was The Original and now it is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZM7H0"">Almondina Almond Cookies, Choconut, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJCXX6"">Almondina Almonduo with Pistachio Biscuits, 4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>. Almondina also makes an assorted 8 cookie flavor giftbox but for some reason Amazon does not carry it, as of March 2010. If your favorite flavor is not under Amazon Prime, keep checking, next week it may be!<br /><br />Each cookie has 35 calories and the package lists the serving size as 4 cookies. For me, usually 2 cookies are filling enough and satisfy my hunger. Cookies have roasted almonds, pitachios and resins. Each cookie has 5.5 gm carbohydrate approximately half of which is sugar, but the company claims it to be ""All Natural"". I guess they consider sugar to be natural!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40"">Biscoff Family Pack</a> are also delicious cookies, with 25 calorie per cookie and roughly the same amount of carbohydrates and sugar per cookie as Almondina, but they are't as filling and you end up consuming more calories. May be it is not possible to make delicious cookies with any less sugar. To give you perspective and comparison, Oreo Cookies have double the sugar and carbohydrate and each serving has 160 calories; and they are not filling so you end up consuming a lot more than one serving at a time. I have't found any other delicious cookies with as low carbohydrate content as Almondina. For me, they make a very healthy snack that satiates my hunger and craving for food."
Thank goodness for this,"Having just move to the USA from Canada, I was wondering how I would drink any soft drinks here at all, considering they are all HFCS which tastes awful. However, I was very happy to see Pepsi throwback. Normally Coca-Cola is my preference, but I have now switched to Pepsi thanks to their use of real sugar."
Very Good No Sugar Added Chocolate Drink Mix - Highly Recommended!,"Nesquick No Sugar Added mix is a welcome treat for me since becoming a Type 2 diabetic. It tastes very close to regular chocolate milk or hot chocolate, but has significantly less carbs. That being said, you do have to watch out for the carbs that milk adds to the 7g that is in the Nesquick.<br /><br />Great tasting - Highly Recommended"
Need help giving your cat medication...try these.,"I've been giving my cat medication for a little over a year now and I just hate prying open his mouth and dropping the pill in.  If I get one of these treats ready beforehand it triggers his attention to the treat instead of the pill.  I give him his medication and then immediately give him the treat.  (not in the same fashion, however)  He used to run and hide every time I opened his pill case now at least he sticks around.  It makes it easier for me too."
THE BEST!,"I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics."
Best body wash ever!,"I read some other reviews and saw that Dove's Body Wash for men dried up skin, clogged up pores, etc...  But remember, everyone's body chemistry is different.<br /><br />For me, this is the best body wash ever as it fits my chemistry perfectly.  I've used so many different face washes in the past, from Jack's to, Niveas, to Adidas, Old Spice and all of them caused me to break out on my face.<br /><br />Only this product does not cause me to get more pimples.  Yes it does dry my face out a little (but every face wash does that).  To remedy that, I put lotion on my face after I shower.  HOwever, after about 2-3 weeks of putting lotion on, I started to break out again so I took a 1 week break from putting on lotion and my skin was clear again.<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />Basically, if your body chemistry is anything like mine, this will make your pimples disappear.<br /><br />It also smells really good - not too overpowering so that it'll mess with any cologne I put on.  As for how it works as a body wash, well I'm not too picky and I don't see any difference from this product than Old Spice or any other men's wash.  But for washing my face, this thing is absolute magic."
soo cute,"the tea was cute and just perfect for the three of us, but the pitcher could be a little bigger. I had to steep three seperate times just for ys to all have a cup"
It's sugar free alright... there is NO sweetness to it whatsoever!,Thought this would be awesome since I am now living a Low Carb lifestyle.  Was very disappointed.  It is very bitter and there is not a bit of sweetness to it.  It's like liquid unsweetened chocolate syrup.  Now I use it in my peppermint tea and add splenda to make it palatable.  These  reviews that rave about it boggle my mind.
The worst 'tea' I have ever tried.,I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
Very creative!,"What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the ""worst"" of ""simple sugars"", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and ""Caramel"", are similar, but ""Maca"" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing."
Talk to me treats,I have a very small dog (4 pounds) and it's hard to find treats for her.  She loves the cheese flavored and the mint flavored treats.  They clean her teeth and she gets something special too.  Perfect for smaller pets.
"Clean, taste-friendly protein",I've only been eating/drinking this stuff for a week but it adapts to any flavor combo and doesn't feel chalky or weird like some powders do.  I love it!  Maybe I should add to my review in a month or two after I know what the true results are with it...
Sticky sticky sticky,"I'm an experienced user of pre-made as well as home-made fondants -- having used Wilton (which tastes the worst), Satin Ice, etc. This was my first use of Fondarific, as I needed red fondant in a hurry and it was the only red fondant available on Amazon that would arrive on time.<br /><br />Big mistake. No matter which technique I used, this stuff stuck and stretched and tore. I will not buy any Fondarific fondant again."
Good flavor,"Although I prefer regular grits, this product really comes in handy when I am in a hurry.  The flavor is really good.  Would take a lot of work to duplicate the flavor using plain grits."
Fun!,"I got this as a little end of the semester gift to myself. It's really fun!<br /><br />I followed the directions that came along and after 5 days in my fridge, a soak and daily misting x1 week, I have a handful of mushrooms ready for harvest. I didn't experience any of the problems that other reviewers had, it might be the humid Vermont spring air, but these things are growing like crazy.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this as a gift for a mushroom lover, science nerd, or anyone who likes to grow things- My Dad will be getting one for Christmas.<br /><br />It does take up some space in your fridge during it's dormant stage (think: 8lb whole chicken big), and you need a space for it that is out of direct sunlight, away from heat sources for it to grow. It should come with the caveat that the box needs to be opened within 30 days, important piece of info if you are planning on gifting."
oh my goodness!!!!!!,"well whats to say, they are the best no wheat, no suger, no dairy cookies i have ever had.  in fact they could hold there own against a regular fat & suger filled cookie!!!"
Texture and taste,"This is great baby food.  It has an interesting texture that our baby likes in her mouth, and she loves the taste.  I love that she gets protein that is more than puree, but not so thick she can choke."
Big Bite Giant Gummy Bears,Items arrived sticky and starting to melt.  Discolored - they were all kind of brown.  Super tough and chewy.  Flavors were off.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone.  Overall very disappointed.
Love the sugar cookies!,"It is so great to have a low-fat, low-calorie, yet delicious brand of cookies available! I don't feel guilty after eating a few, and trust me, you will eat a few!!! I have a friend with a gluten allergy and its great to have something to offer her when she comes over that I can enjoy as well.  Definitely worth trying!"
IT WORKS  FOR ME,"I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck"
What's not to love...,"Just right...bold enough to carry the morning without a bite.  Perfect, you will not go wrong with Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold."
Wonderful Croustades (Crispy Cups),"I have been using these croustades for many years, but I am now finding them hard to get.  I am delighted that Amazon will have them.<br /><br />They are extremely versatile.  I use them for both savories and sweets, but sweets are my favorites!  Their only drawback is that many recipes cannot be made far ahead, since the cups do soften, so I make many things ahead, popping goodies into the cups at the last minute.<br /><br />Some things can be made ahead; I make mini pecan pies, using my usual recipe with more, and finer ground pecans.  They bake up in about ten minutes, and keep for weeks.  I also make tartlets ahead by pouring melted chocolate, white, dark or milk, into the shell, tipping to cover to the edges and draining on a rack over a pan.  When set up, these will take chocolate mousse, ganache truffle mixtures, unbaked cheesecake mixtures, lemon curd, etc., and will be crisp for days.  They are beautiful additions to a dessert tray.  I also make mini pumpkin and mince pies, but these will soften eventually.  I quickly fill them and bake them just before dinner, or just before dinner's end, and they are delicious with a dab of brandied whipped cream or hard sauce for the mince.<br /><br />These are less trouble than either phyllo or puff pastry, and are thinner, allowing more of the taste of the filling to dominate.  There are a million uses I haven't mentioned; only your imagination limits you!"
very good,"I found this Bar Harbor lobster bisque at my small ""Shurfine"" grocery store.  It was expensive at $4.69 a can but I bought it to try.  I added about 1/2 can of milk and some port wine and a little salt and I thought it to be very good.  Had plenty of lobster and smelled like lobster.  I didn't find it strong of tomato.  Bisque is made with tomato.  If you want chowder you buy clam chowder.  I guess you can't please everyone's taste buds.  I would definitely purchase again."
Wonderful!,"I used to be a big espresso drinker, but frankly it started to really give my stomach lots of problems.<br />Then, I asked the people at Starbucks what coffee they serve as their drip. They told me it was some medium roast.<br /><br />I went to Costco and purchased this Colombian roast and really have enjoyed it. It is very smooth where the espresso<br />coffee was too acidic for me. I find the value to be fantastic. It sure beats a lot of the prices that I have found in town. I would recommend purchasing it directly from Costco, though."
one of my favorite foods,"This stuff is absolutely amazing. Like everything else I've tried from Artisana, the coconut butter is really something different, in a whole other league from other brands. I eat this right out of the jar. It's great mixed with raw cacao, raw agave nectar and a little sea salt; makes unbelievable raw chocolate fudge (melt coconut butter in a double boiler at 105 degrees, mix all ingredients, spread on wax paper and cool)!"
Grilled Fennel Ciacco Brand,"Tasted this product at a gourmet market in Bainbridge, WA and fell in love...it is delicious over grilled white fish (Halibut etc.) And healthy too!"
This has to be a mistake,Two 3 oz packets of pectin should be about four bucks.  I hope this is a case price but nothing in the information says otherwise.
"Great taste, easy to prepare","Tastes great, very fluffy, just add water.  Doesn't get any easier than this!  Just wish the blueberries weren't artificial."
disappointing,"I liked the fact that it was easily washable and had measurements on the outside. Unfortunately the lettering was illegible in a few spots and got worse with time.  Then.. after only a few months, it started to leak out the bottom. Needless to say, I can't recommend it."
Wicked good,"These are awesome. And good for you to boot. Sure there's probably a little too much salt, but everything in moderation, right..."
CRAZY ABOUT THESE TREATS!!,"These treats come in Salmon and Duck....my dogs LOVE both. They go crazy when they even see the bag.... Perfect size for a training treat. These treats stay moist...I have the Bear Treats also, they are good too, but more of a dried salmon ""meal"" consistency."
ice treats,My dogs love the tasty cubes especially on a hot day.  The only downside to the trays is the cubes are little hard to get out of the tray.  But easy to make and a fun treat for the dogs.
Stevia Liquid,"I do not like wasting calories on sweetening tea, and I drink a lot, so I have been using Splenda and Sweet 'N Low for years.  However, Splenda seems to interfere with my weight loss and I also wonder about the long-term health consequences.<br /><br />My first attempt at using stevia was Sun Crystals, which is half sugar and half stevia.  You could consider it a gateway drug to going natural.  It helped me overcome the bitter aftertaste, which is no longer an issue.  In fact, I prefer stevia over Splenda now!<br /><br />There are many forms of stevia, but I like liquid because it has no filler and mixes easily.  It also goes a long way.  SweetLeaf in particular has a very pure taste and the dropper bottle is great for dosing drinks by the preferred amount.  For baking, which Splenda handles like a pro, I have found Sweetleaf lacking.  The baking process seems to erase the sweetness, even though it holds up to hot tea.  It is also important to use Sweetleaf only in applications where it can be mixed in completely.  As with liquid artificial sweetener, it is very bitter before dilution.<br /><br />SweetLeaf is a pretty perfect way to sweeten drinks, even though it does not work for baking.  If you are brave enough to go through the initial period of ""breaking in"" to stevia flavor, I highly recommend it."
best salt,I read that the Tibetan Pink Sea Salt is the healthiest to use.  That may be true but I like the flavor of this product and I prefer the fine ground because I believe I use a bit less salt due to the fine texture.  I am a happy customer.
Great product!,"After having pup on Taste of the Wild and Solid Gold Barking at the Moon, did some research to find another premium grain-free food but at a lower price and found this.  Excellent stuff.<br /><br />My year and a half old chihuahua has been on it for a few months now and couldn't be doing any better.  Both he and our two cats (who are on Purina but steal the Epigen, which they seem to prefer, out of the dog's bowl) seem to love it. And pellet size is just right for them all, very small.<br /><br />Just purchased a second bag and will continue purchasing this. Very happy with the product and it's price!"
Keurig Pumpkin-spice K-cups,I've ordered the pumpkin-spice K-cups before for my Keurig coffee maker and just love the flavor.  And ordering it through Amazon is so easy and fast!
Good Coffee!,I have bought this coffee in the past through Keurig and was happy to find that Amazon carried it.  It was also a good deal because I ended up getting %25 off the listed price.
Mellow and robust! This is the best.,"When I want a treat that won't break the bank, this is it. Twenty-four mugs of perfect coffee delivered to my door."
Awesome stuff,Texas Pete makes great stuff and this is no diff. If you like honey mustard give this a try. Everyone in my house thinks its great.
Not as bad as the big sellers,"Common brands of mayonnaise (Hellman's) taste horrible to me. Spectrum tastes better. 365 brand mayonnaise (which is also apparently distributed by Whole Foods Market) tastes even better than Spectrum. Spectrum comes in glass (which can break), 365 in plastic. Of course, both glass and plastic are recyclable. Usually, Amazon has very good prices, but this product has been given a much higher price than in the stores."
Keurig coffee refils,Love this decaf that has extra body.  Twin packs arrived on time or earlier and without damage.  Would certainly order again.
Tangy and sweet,"Remember the commercials that said ""A sandwich just isn't a sandwich without the tangy zip of Miracle Whip""?<br />It's not a sandwich, it's something else. Possibly with mayonnaise and mustard, a nice thick slice of ham and a pickle between two pieces of bread. But it is not a sandwich. A sandwich needs Miracle Whip. It also needs American cheese and possibly fried bologna.<br />Miracle Whip has less fat than mayo and a lot more flavor. Lots of spices and a ton of sugar and/or high fructose corn syrup give it that signature sweetness. It's not to everyone's taste. People who grew with Miracle Whip consider it mayonnaise. People who grew up with mayonnaise are surprised to have a sandwich made with this instead.<br />It's also very good mixed with tuna."
Lives Up to illy's Standard,"I'm a big ice coffee drinker but I usually prefer to either make it myself or purchase it from a coffee shop where I know it's at least been made on the premise. Freshness is generally something that you can recognize when it comes to coffee. That's why I avoid drinks like those Starbucks Double Shot cans. They taste generic and fake.<br /><br />I usually use a Tassimo pod based brewer to get my caffeine fix but I've made coffee using illy beans before. It really is great coffee. As far as coffee drinks go, it's pretty hard to beat the illy issimo coffee drink. It actually tastes like coffee and isn't drowned out by preservatives or whatever other junk they put into canned coffee.<br /><br />I tend to take my coffee with as little milk as possible. I found that the milk level in this drink was fine, something that I usually take umbrage with when it comes to canned coffee. I suppose you could add more milk if you really wanted to, but I wouldn't bother.<br /><br />The price for a pack of twelve of these is a bit steep for coffee, but I guess it makes sense considering what the other canned coffees cost. If canned coffee is your thing, certainly go for the illy coffee drink. It really does taste quite good."
My favorite!,"My favorite candy store sold this amazing strawberry licorice in small bags so it never had a brand name. I would go get a small bag every week. suddenly they started stocking a different, horrible licorice after being out of it for a few weeks. The new one was waxy and hard and had no taste whatsoever...well I take that back it had a slight taste of cough syrup. I started searching online based on reviews to find the one they originally stocked and I found it here! This is not hard and waxy...It is firm, but has a  matte look instead of a glossy look. It taste very fruity. This is my favorite strawberry licorice! SO much better than twizzlers and the like. Also, this is a good price on it."
"Arrived Quick, Good","The product arrived right away, was boxed nicely, put in pantry, whenever I want a can of tuna it's there, good price"
Verifiably Vet Approved,"It pains me to have to disagree with reviewer K.Wessel. The information in that review is incorrect. This product is healthy for cats. Maybe not so for humans, but healthy for the digestive tract of a cat. My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans. The ingredients may sound awful to us, but it's not our health we should be concerned with when buying pet food."
Coffee house flavor for about 40 cents a cup,"I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or ""burnt"" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time."
Mother's Taffy Cookies,"We used to enjoy these cookies when we lived in CA where they were made. We missed them terribly when we moved and even bought 8 packs to take with us. When we saw them on Amazon we jumped at the chance to set up a regular shipment to us. They are no longer made in CA but taste exactly the same. They are simply the best and arrive perfectly packed and fresh right on time. There is not another cookie that I know of that's even close!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDGYN8"">Mother's Taffy Sandwich Cookies, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>"
Deeeeeeeee-Licious!!,"After you've had these, I guarantee, you will NOT want or crave real french fries--honestly!! I just finished off my first bag (from a case) of the ""jalapeno trio."" They were absolutely Deeeeee-licious and sooooo satisfying as far as crunchy-nous, salty-nous, and were very flavorful. Loved them! And, so low in calories. A full-bag with only 2 grams of fat and only 110 calories!"
Very disapointed,They shipped the far worse Taiwan version even though they both pictured a different product as well as putting Japanese in the description.
great coffee,"This is a great product.  So easy to use,  makes consistent coffee every time"
HEALTHY AND DELICIOUS,THIS ITEM IS GREAT.  100% FRUIT AND STILL GREAT TASTING.  MY KID LOVES THESE THINGS.  HE IS A LOVER OF FRUIT SNACKS AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS HEALTHY AND TASTEFUL AND I'VE FOUND IT.
Great deal for an excellent tea!,Love this double bergamont Earl Grey Tea!  Very flavorful.  Highly recommend it when the mood is for a black tea.<br />It pays to shop around!  For some reason this box of loose (foil wrapped) bags was cheaper than the retail box of boxes.  Be careful to compare total shipped price and count how many bags you will get.  Some places were selling just a single box of 12 bags for 1/2 the total price of this product!
Gotta love Gerber,"I love buying with Amazon's subscribe and save.  I order enough baby food for a month and at great prices.  It comes right to the house and I don't have to mess with all the little containers in my cart at the grocery store...two kids and a cart full of groceries is enough to contend with!  Love Gerber, love Amazon and love, love Subscribe and Save!"
Good Korean Ginseng Tea,"This is the powdered Korean ginseng tea I had been looking for. It came quickly, in great condition, good value, and I would buy again."
Delicious!,"I am completely addicted to these things and I eat them all day, every day. This is the best brand because they are made only with olive oil, not canola oil. I read the post from the person who thinks they taste like the bottom of the sea, and felt the need to post my opposite opinion. Yes, there are some people who have not acquired a taste for seaweed (my daughter for one). But for anyone who likes sushi, they would probably LOVE these seaweed snacks. I felt in love the first time I bit into one, and always keeps a couple cases at my house."
Love True Lemon!!!,I always ask for lemon with my water. This is a great alternative to real lemons and just as delicious.
My kids (and I) LOVE these!,"I LOVE this product.  My 12 month old and 3 year old can't get enough of them.  I used to buy the Baby Mum-Mums, because it was a choke-free snack that kept babies and toddlers busy and happy, but I always had serious qualms about the fact that they were made in china.  After passing these by in the store forever, I finally picked up the Coco pop cakes at Whole Foods one day and realized it was PERFECT.  It totally melts in baby's mouth, just like the mum-mums, so a great non-chokable snack for anywhere.  My baby loves crunching on it, it makes him so happy and keeps him occupied.  And since they are light and airy, I don't worry that I'm filling my kids up on too many crackers.  Its also very neat.  Don't know why these aren't marketed more towards kids/babies, they'd make a gold mine if they did.<br /><br />Note - I haven't actually purchased these from Amazon yet, only at Whole Foods.  But we go through them so fast at our house (not only do the kids love it, but the adults do too for all types of light snacks), but I plan to buy them from here so that I can get them in bulk."
Interesting taste,"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!"
Great 100 Calorie Treat!!,"I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!"
Wonderful,Wonderful and spicy but don't buy here unless you have money to burn. Go to your local Indian Grocery store. Thats were we buy this product. Its a dollar less plus no shipping cost. Enjoy! Its good.
Decent Set of Flavors But,"You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.  My favorites are Diet Orange, Diet Raspberry/Cranberry, and Diet Energy. Diet Dr. Pete and Diet Root Beer aren't bad either.  They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping."
Folgers Cappuccino Coffee,"I use to buy this product at Walmart, but they do not always carry it.  So I purchased this product on line.  It arrived in the number of days it said it would and if you are a cappuccino lover like I am, it was worth it to buy a case.<br />I'm due for another order soon and this time.....I'm buying TWO cases!!!<br />Excellent product, you will like it also."
Scottish Dogs,"I have know for several years this is the best licorice there is, dut last week I discovered this AWESOME deal. 10 pounds for less than 30 bucks. I was paying more for only 5 pounds! All I can say is this is a fantastic deal! Delicious, fantastic, wonderful, Don't miss out."
chocolatey goodness,"These haven't been available at the stores near here, so I took a chance ordering them. I'm glad I did. When I just want a little chocolate flavor, this is a crunchy and tasty alternative. And they're really good with peanut butter sandwiches--just sweet enough but not overpowering."
Better than Sunkist and Orangina!,"Ever since I learned about the dangers of sugar and chemical sugars, I have avoided them like the plague.  Then when I accidentally discovered an online ad for a ""stevia-sweetened"" soft drink named Zevia, well, let's just say I was hooked.<br /><br />Zevia is an alternative to diet soda that is sweetened with my two favorite sweeteners: erythritol and stevia. Wow! There is no calcium-removing phosphoric acid like you'd find in regular toxic sodas. And the taste is great! I've only tried the Orange and Natural Twist flavors with Orange being my favorite so far. I hear they came out with a new root beer flavor so that makes a total of four different Zevia sodas to choose from.<br /><br />Diabetics and those with Candida will welcome this new alternative to soda. I know me and my father sure did. Can't wait to open a nice cold one right after I write this review. Ahhhhhh!"
Tully's French Roast,"This coffee has turned out to be my very favorite in K-cups.  It is the best of the ""bolds""- full-bodied, rich tasting and is a great way to start my day."
Terrible Customer Service from Euro Food Mart,"I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted. I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. This chocolate bar in particular was disappointing in texture as well. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity. My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service experience with Euro Food Mart.  I would not order from them again."
Best Chai ever!!,I also first tried Mystic Chai Spiced Tea when Sam's Club sold it. But when they stopped I had torn off the label from my last can I had purchased which had their email on it.  Well I just found it about a month ago and immediately emailed the company. They responded quickly letting me know I can still purchase it online at Sam's Club or straight from them but I checked with Amazon just in case and found it. It is just as great as I remember it. I have also tried other chai's but they do not EVEN come close to Mystic Chai.  You will not go wrong with Mystic Chai.
YUMMY!,"I love these bars!  It is hard to find decent gluten-free snacks, and, these are a treasure!  They are packed with crunchy nuts and sweet fruit.  I like that they are all natural, too.  I don't feel guilty indulging with these.  They are great to take along to the office, for lunch or snacks, or on the road, and, considering their size, they are really quite filling and satisfying! They are, of course, a little pricey, but, buying them by the case from Amazon (especially if you use Subscribe and Save) makes them less expensive than they are at the local health food store. Excellent!"
Aromatic Excellence !,"The aroma, taste, quality and excellence will drive you to the kitchen to start preparing your favorite recepies !<br />Stay Safe,<br />F. Wade McReynolds<br />Carmichael, CA"
I like my coffee like I like my women... EXTRA BOLD!!,I've only had my Keurig since March and have been ordering and consuming coffees which are labeled 'extra bold'. I first ordered Green Mountain Double Diamond which I thought was great. I then ordered Starbucks Sumatra which was also good but seemingly inconsistent with regard to taste (strange). I received Jet Fuel today. I thought it was going to be hard to top the Double Diamond but Coffee People have done did it! This stuff is FANTASTIC!! I will definitely be ordering this again and again.
Not too bad!,"I bought this together with the skinless and boneless sardines (105g) made by the same company - Angelo Parodi because the other one was supposed the best sardine in the list of a sardine lover.  I found that is simply not the case.  Strangely, this sardines is actually better than the skinless/boneless one.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />(1) More substance - this can of sardine weighs 120g, only slightly more than the boneless/skinless (105g), however, they actually have a lot more sardines than the other one because the other one only have a few sardines floating in a lot of olive oil.  This one actually have more ""meat"" and at a price of $ 2.89 comparing to the $ 3.69 for the boneless/skinless version, this one is a better buy.<br /><br />(2) Taste - it has a really good and firm texture.  The sizes of the sardines are a little big.  They remind me of the Delmonte sardines in tomato sauce I used to eat when I was young.  They did not have any fishy taste. (*I cannot stand any fishes that have fishy taste) It is just a little bit too salty for me but really not bad.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Like the can of the boneless/skinless sardines, it is very difficult to open the can by pulling the ring.  It is very easy to cut yourself if you are not careful."
The Best Glutenfree Pancakes....,This mix is the best.... The pancakes are so awesome our whole family eats them. They are light and fluffy and very tastey. We serve them to everyone. They don't even realize they are gluten free and they all love them too. We love Pamela's Products because it makes being gluten free so much easier and convenient.
YUM!,I mix 2 tablespoons a day and smear it on rye toast!.....YUM....just like when I was a kid but this time without all the fat and calories!
happy mama,My baby loved it and she can be a picky eater. There are a lot of nutrients in it which is always good. Overall satisfied. The only disadvantage to this cereal is it needs something else added to it. If I didn't add fruit my baby would not eat it. Some of the other baby cereals I've bought she would eat without any fruit in it. But not this one. It had to have fruit.
If you like honey you must try this one!,"This is an amazingly delicious honey.  I was only mildly interested in honey before trying the Breitsamer Golden and now I can't think of a better desert than fresh fruit salad with plain yogurt laced with this divine product.  In fact, I love it so much that just eating a small teaspoon by itself brings a smile to my face.  I'm no honey expert but I can't imagine a more delicious honey than this one.<br /><br />Just thinking about it makes to want to have some more! Now if I can just sneak by my husband and into the kitchen cupboard.  (Unfortunately, he is not as happy as I am about my newfound love for this honey.)  Well, if you like honey, give this one a try.  I don't think you'll be diappointed!"
One of the best!,"This is by far not only one of the best gluten free pastas I've had , but one of the best pastas period.  Meaning I would pick this over most glutenous pastas.  Has a very great taste to it and will continue to buy this pasta for as long as it's around!"
Best jerky size/brand/flavor you can get,"I have personally been on a mission to find my favorite jerky for a few years now.  This is by far my favorite jerky - just a little spicy, great texture, perfect size for a snack, and pretty healthy besides sodium."
Campbells Tomato Juice is absolutley the best!,"As another review notes, the sodium content on this product could be an issue for folks on sodium restricted diets, but for people who do not feel that is an issue (it isn't for me), this tomato juice is far and away the best- and so much less expensive that some other brands- especially those sold at ""whole paycheck"".  If you are on a sodium restricted diet, try Campbells Low Sodium Tomato Juice."
Best Tassimo flavor,"Kenya is the best I have tried for Tassimo. We first got some for an office Tassimo machine at a startup I worked for. After a few weeks, that was all anyone would drink. (Gevalia was our backup.) It reminds me of the coffee we used to get in Vienna at one of my favorite cafes."
Very good product,This is one of the few products that my dog can eat without getting and upset stomach.  I think is one of the best products that you can give to that family member that you love.
Not like Claim Jumper,"Claim Jumper restaurants use Helen Grace's Fudge Topping on their Mud Pie dessert. I had this dessert recently and liked the fudge accent so well I decided to buy some. Unfortunately, my experience at home was that the Fudge Topping out of the jar tastes different from the topping at the restaurant, it's far sweeter out of the jar. It also seemed to be of a different consistency. The Fudge Topping out of the jar, even though it started out warm and smooth, froze instantly into unappetizing globs on top of the ice cream. I'm not sure what the explanation is for these differences, although I suspect Claim Jumper somehow tweaks the topping before serving it. At Claim Jumper on top of their Mud Pie, it's fabulous, but at home, out of the jar, this topping was a disappointment. Helen Grace does offer refunds though and their customer service is excellent, and that's why I gave them two stars."
Perfect for the caffine sensitive,"I have tried pills, (Stacker, Hydoxicut, etc). I tried the drinks, (Rock Star, Amp, coffee,etc). But all of them made me jittery and made me feel uneasy, even before an intense workout. I go to the gym at 5:30AM everyday and take one of these on the way out the door. As soon as I get halfway to the gym, I cannot wait to hit the weights! Now sometimes I will add a sugar free Red Bull on leg day, but one of these usually does the trick on regular days. I love this stuff. I hate the feeling most pills and drinks give me. This stuff just makes me feel alert."
Love these!,My kids love the Vanilla snackimals and I think they taste great too.  It's nice to find a small bagged snack that doesn't contain GM ingredients and tastes good.
Do NOT buy this popcorn!,"This popcorn totally  refused to pop. No matter what way we tried to pop this popping corn, it was a total  failure.I would not only NOT EVER  recomend it to a friend, I would go out of my way  to warn them to  not to waste their money.It ended up in the garbage."
"Tasted burnt, but company sent new pack!","I was so excited to get these, but the taste was nothing like I remembered!  The cookies tasted burnt, and the color was a lot darker than pictured.  When I contacted the company, they blamed it on the packaging, saying they hear this complaint a lot with the family pack.  The person I talked to said I'd have more luck with the individually wrapped ones, so she sent me a free box of those.  I'm not quite sure how the recipe/cooking process would be different based on how the cookie is packaged--makes no sense to me!--but the company did redeem themselves by offering a new pack.  And they do indeed taste a little better."
Strange Brew's Cooper's Irish Beer Kit,"Kit arrived in as described condition. After brewing this kit I'm very pleased with it. The Beer is bottle conditioning right now so I haven't tried the finished product, but the uncarbonated stout tasted great.<br /><br /> I have no doubt the finished product will be awesome. I Highly Recommend this Kit if you like Stouts. Get your's brewing now for St. Patricks Day, Cheers!"
Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible,"Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.  It was horrid.  Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware."
homemade food,"I typically make my own dogfood but when I'm short on time, I cook the veggies & use this canned chicken. My dogs love it!"
great taste...replaces sweetner in everything,"taste is great! i use it in all my recipes that call for a sweetner, my coffee, pancakes...anything and everything!! great stuff"
Treat Review,My dogs LOVE these treats! I use them for training treats cause you can break them up easy and they are soft.  I did have a problem one time with a bag but the company was great with handling the problem.  They were quick to respond and very polite.  I will continue to buy these and other products from this company!  And they are made in America.
Tulips,"I ordered flowers for my mom for her birthday and when she received them they were warm and wilted.  I was reimbursed for the full amount of my order and a  replacement was sent to my mothers house.  I was content with the manner that amazon handled that situation, and I was surprised they sent a replacement.  Although I would rather had them sent perfect the first time, overall I was pleased with the order."
High quality product,"I have been giving this bisquit to my dog. Tired of buying the bag frequently, I searched for a better deal online for 20 lb box. I got the box cheaper than buying equivalent amount of bags even after adding shipping cost. My dog loves this bisquits. Only problem, though it is minor. was that there are more broken pieces than good conditioned bag product. It is understandable but I hope there are less of that."
so yummy!,This salt has a slightly earthy taste. It is moderately coarse. I bought a ceramic grinder for when I would like to have it a little finer. I love this salt!
Yummy- after you get used to it,"This is a great snack bar.  But don't expect normal chocolate taste.  It's different.  Not horrible, but different.  After the first bite and you kinda adjust it's fine.  I think the vanilla one is a little more of a real taste.  But the bar itself is great- I love the low sugar- definitely the best low sugar chocolate protein bar I have tasted."
Excellent Organic Cracker,Just love the flavor and the fact that it has a lot of protein and fiber for a cracker..Also.being that it is an Organic product and non -gmo..is also a plus !
Wow!  A Great Coffee.,"Starbucks, be gone.  Dunkin Dougnut dark roast, no way.  Lavazaza Gran Filtro Dark Roast is a great coffee, and certainly underpriced based on the quality and robust smell and taste!  This is one outstanding premium coffee, do not miss trying it and you will have a new favorite."
Not Really Jerky To Me,"The flavor was very good for this product but the texture is far too soft. I had read that and was looking for a softer, easier to chew jerky but this is not a jerky texture at all.<br /><br />It was more like cooked steak strips thank jerky."
Yum!,My dog is very happy with this treat...and he isn't as able to gobble down so quickly. The Dingo brand seems to be his favorite.
"Fresh, Wholesome and Delightful","If you like vanilla and hazelnut, you will like this tea.  The flavor is robust but not overpowering.  The ingredients are fresh and smell tantalizing! I have this tea in my pantry year-round.  I buy it because of the quality ingredients, excellent taste, and healthful benefits.  Yogi is the BEST in herbal teas."
TASTES GREAT !!,This is trully a great tasting product. I am on a low carb diet and have not had any spaghetti in months. I tried this product and I love it. I will continue to use this product even if I go off this diet.
Smells and tastes like fresh brewed coffee but so much easier,I ordered the decaf version. It arrived as promised. It smells and tastes just like fresh brewed coffee to me. I love that I can make either hot coffee or iced coffee so easily. I don't know why grocery stores don't sell this product.
Finally might wean my cat off Fancy Feast,"The first morning I set this down for my cat she gobbled up nearly two of the three ounce cans.  With subsequent feedings  her zeal has waned but she does manage to eat one can every morning, in do-able doses.  Then she gets her beloved Fancy Feast in the evening.  I want very much to get Fancy Feast out of the cycle because even though the classic recipes contain no grains, it does contain by-products and also fish and my cat has a fish allergy.  This Weruva chicken is wonderful stuff.  All white meat with vitamins and minerals in a bit of sauce.  Even comes in a BPA-free can.  There is zero stench, something I certainly can not say about Fancy Feast.  I am hoping she will continue to eat this product each morning for now because at least I'm cutting the amount of Fancy Feast down by half.  I plan to use up the Fancy Feast on hand in this way and ease her over to all Weruva.  Now an update - several weeks into the new feeding regime and my cat is happily eating up a three ounce can of this food every morning.  Without hesitation too!  I am so happy to have found a quality canned cat food that my sweetie loves.  Something I am enjoying is not having to break apart and chop up a semi-solid mass of pate style cat food.  This Weruva recipe comes out of the can ready to eat, I just remove the lid and pour the contents into a bowl.  I hope Amazon will add this product to their Subscribe and Save program."
Good Stuff,I bought it for the Brits who I am embedded with in Afghanistan.  They totally flipped over it.  Planning on buying more.
Never tasted cheddar cheese like this!,I really wanted to like these after reading all of the good reviews.  I am not a cheese snob.  I like Baked Lays with cheddar flavor.  But something in the flavor of these cheddar Popchips is not right.  The first bite is OK but then there is a bitter aftertaste.  Too bad.  Back to Lays!
love this stuff!!,So I've used it twice now...only for my hair ..I just put it all over my head and leave it in for about 2 hours..then wash it out really good because if you leave some in after you shower it still feels oily...I usually have to wash my hair twice<br />..but it feels sooooo soft after I use it.  I notice that my ends haven't been breaking as bad..and im the type of person that styles my hair almost everyday :) definitely recommend.
No drop in Blood Pressure,"I tried this product, but saw no drop in blood pressure.  I found that hibiscus tea helps a great deal.  I started taking some blueberry hibiscus tea from [...] and it really works.  3-4 cups a day takes me from about 135/97 to 120/80.  I've actually gone below 120/80.  It is extremely effective in my case."
Delicious and Crisp!,"I was at Gilt (in Portland, OR) enjoying some delicious cocktails and asked the bartender what kind of cherries were in my drinks, because they are not the same kind you buy in the grocery store.  She went to the back room, looked in the pantry, and told me the name of these cherries.  My friend and I went in on a can and divided them up into six smaller mason jars.  We both brandied a couple of our jars and they are perfect for Old Fashions and Manhattans.  These are truly delicious, decadent, and worth the money."
A great food for our dogs,"I have been feeding Fromm Four Star Beef Frittata for the last month to my bichons and chihuahua.<br />The ingredients are healthful, no byproducts, grains or artificial anything. It's a family run company with its own production mill and has never had a recall, which is reassuring in today's day and age with all the recalls and sick pets!<br /><br />The kibble size is quite small, which is great for my 4 pound Chihuahua.  The other dogs don't seem to mind the kibble size at all.<br /><br />Coats are looking beautiful. I have one super sensitive bichon whose skin has stayed in good shape on this food, thankfully.  She gets yeast infections on her skin (ears, toes, face/muzzle) that can make her quite miserable.  Fromm has kept her in great shape!<br /><br />Back yard clean-up is good.  Initially when I switched the girls to Fromm, they had a little gas but once acclimated have not been gassy at all.<br /><br />Great food!  Transitioning/rotating to the Game Bird recipe now and will report on that too!"
Only dog food I will use,"After reading horrible reviews about dog food and with the onset of my puppy having seizures, I made him only home cooked meals specifically for dogs.  He was having stomach problems and went through many different recipes always consulting with my Vet, but then I found Halo dog food.  My dog eats this and looks for more, his stomach problems have subsided and he's doing very well. This was such a relief due to his seizures and stomach problems and I tried so hard to make him well.  He's been on Halo canned chicken Spots Stew now for 2 months and I am so relieved.  Now if only I could do something about the seizures, all would be well.  However, I give very high recommendations for Halo food.  A bit expensive, but worth every penny.  I need to add that I know how much Ellen Degeneres loves dogs and put my trust in her advocating Halo food.  I'm not sorry. Thanks Ellen.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it and offering monthly subscriptions."
chewy treats,My golden retriever loves them. You can chop them into squares if you want smaller treats.
24 count K-cup sampler,"I just received the sampler a few days after I ordered it. The K-cups were in a brown paper bag and stapled close. It was wrapped in an air wrap so they weren't damaged in any way. I thought it was a little odd that they were just in a paper bag, but it doesn't really matter. I got these for my mom for her birthday so I just put them in another bag. There were several different flavors. Overall, no complaints; reasonably priced. I've read a few negative reviews, but they seem to be rare. If you're looking for some K-cups, go for it."
Solves my daily dilemma,"Both Oreos and Nutter Butters are available for purchase at my workplace. You get 6 Oreos or 4 Nutter Butters for $1. Every day I AGONIZE unable to decide. But that's all over now.<br /><br />These Peanut Creme Oreos solve my dilemma. They taste more like a Nutter Butter or Peanut Butter Cup than they do like an Oreo, but have enough chocolate to sate me.<br /><br />Each cookie is one Oreo wafer that actually seems thinner than a regular Oreo wafer, spread with a thin layer of peanut butter creme, then the whole thing is covered in chocolate. I do wish the wafer were a little thicker, or that there were a second wafer like a regular Oreo, but it's still good as it is.<br /><br />Of note is that the package depicted on this product is NOT the same as what I received. I didn't think I was getting the peanut butter kind, was dismayed when I did, but then thrilled once I tried them.<br /><br />I often receive Vine products and think, well, that's nice, but I'd never actually buy it for myself. But I might start buying these for myself. Obsessively."
Simply the Best!,"The Cravings Place mixes are simply the best Gluten Free mixes around.  Not only that, but they are dairy free and egg free as well, AND no artificial anything or overly processed ingredients.  Another BIG PLUS is that while so many ""allergen free"" mixes require you to then add the very allergens that you are trying to avoid to make the mix work properly, The Cravings Place mixes generally only require water and perhaps oil or dairy free margarine to get delicious baked goods.<br /><br />I cannot recommend them enough. Delicious, healthy, natural, easy, quick and allergen free from bag to table! (-:"
Tanka very much!,"I've used beef jerky before for a low carb snack, but it's not really my favorite thing.  I rather like this one because it has a barbecue taste to it.  It has a sweetness that is also tangy, and is not a ""sweet treat"" that leaves one craving more.  Also thumbs up for the non-chemical ingredients.  As for it being ""wet and greasy"" as noted by some,  I just open the top and peel it down halfway, using the bottom part as the holder; keeping the hands clean."
Great Tea,Great tea and a great bargain if you own a K cup machine. Buy your coffee or tea at Amazon. The prices are great and the service is great. Ordering from Amazon direct is seamless.
I love this product,I had never tried a Harissa Sauce before.  I had a friend turn me on to this product and now I am hooked.  It compliments so many different foods adding great flavor and a nice kick.  It is also great as a dip.
Great Tea,"Stash has been making wonderful teas for many years, and this is one of their best.  It is a green tea, with raspberry and pomegranate bits for flavor.  It is also a healthy tea.  I put freh or frozen fruit in it sometimes, which makes it even better.  I love this tea!!"
Choking and vomiting,"My mother-in-law bought these from our vet the other day because they aren't fattening and are good for teeth. My dogs love them (I have two Labradors). But, yesterday, I gave them each one to chew and my Chocolate Lab choked. He was gasping for breath, and fortunately threw up the chew and his breakfast. I say fortunately because I suspect he would have choked to death otherwise. My other Lab threw up over night, and I suspect it was from these chews. I'm getting rid of them and won't buy them again. These things should come with a warning label."
Great tea but price increased,"I bought the Greenpowder Green Tea and tastes great. The Jasmine also has a great taste and aroma.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon has increased its price close to 20% in a about a month. I don't imagine the tea having increased by that amount in the stores."
wonderful!!,I love the BIG flakes of this coconut. It is perfect in homemade granola or for a snack for children.
Fantastic!,Peanuts were shipped very quickly and I received them 2 days after placing the order.  They taste great and are exactly as described.
Basic tea. Great price.,"I use this tea for support of high blood pressure. It offers the same benefits as other brands that cost 2 or 3 times as much.<br /><br />The taste is hibiscus tea - no better or worse than any other. If you want to pay 3 times the price to the producer to add some Stevia (not to my taste) and package it in a round tin can, go ahead. Or you can buy this one and sweeten yourself, or combine it with another tea.<br /><br />You won't find a better deal on an pretty rare herb tea."
Not for us,I bought the 24 piece variety pack and each of my four kids did not finish their rope. We eat a lot of organics but they each turned up their noses at these. They are very soft and sticky but there is not a lot of taste. Fruitabu and Stretch Island are better.
this seller and product,"I don't need to waite for the product to rate either it or the seller. The product from long exsperience ,is excellent, with proven results in my personal kitchen along with the results from my freinds kitchens.<br />  The seller is always a pleasure to deal with. I never have to bother them with complaints because the transactions always go perfectly smooth."
The Absolute Best - No Exceptions!,"First a comment on the Natural Flavor - As many other reviewers have noted, the natural popcorn is absolutely unique and delicious, coming out of the microwave crisp and staying that way, even if stored overnight in a Ziploc bag. Unlike air popped corn it is not at all dry and even somehow manages, for me anyway, a light butter flavor. It is lightly salted which is perfect for me. My husband adds salt to his.<br /><br />As others have noted with all flavors of this popcorn, microwave timing can be a bit tricky. -Keep it in there long enough and nearly every kernel pops but you might wind up with a few on the extra crispy side.<br /><br />My reason for mentioning the natural flavor first is that it will always be my all time biggie favorite and is the basis for this product. Right now however, I am loving the ""Sweet & Salty"". It has the same attributes of the natural flavor with just a hint of sweetness that is very pleasant and satisfying.<br /><br />Man do I love this stuff - I think the family is planning an intervention based on stash I keep in pantry to ensure there is always some on hand."
"Meh, it's Stevia.","The vanilla is pleasant enough, but it still has that Stevia aftertaste.<br />I'm going back to sugar (in moderation, of course)."
not lemon balm?,"Ordered this stuff because of the wonderful antiox etc you retrieve from lemon balm, kind of stunk you could only purchase 3 at a time instead of one.<br />But I grow lemon balm in my own garden and dry it for teas etc, and with this I thought YAY none i have to dry and wait for the tea myself. But from observing it NO SMELL of lemons in the tea can itself..as a tea I dont taste any lemon...so makes me wonder what it really is only because with my experience with lemon balm as an herb smells and taste like a lemony scent..with this nothing."
thumbs up!!,"great product, i love this tea, a hint of lemon not too strong or over powering. good tea to wind down with."
Excellent product.,"I have only owned my Nescaf&eacute; Dolce Gusto machine for a little over a month and already I am ""addicted"" to the coffee drinks.<br />In my opinion the quality of this coffee is superior to regular pod brewers."
Great dark bread,"I love dark, dense bread - and this fits the bill for me.  It's certainly<br />better than the squishy, tasteless bread from the grocery."
Very deep flavor,"The leaves are miniscule, so you'll need a mesh steeper. Davidson's have  improved their packaging and now use a resealable bag. Regardless, I take some out into a little tin and seal the rest so it stays fresh. To serve, I had a drop of honey. Usually I add a bit of milk and froth it."
The ad,"I know that the product is good but your ad says ""30sachets at 20grams each equals 300 grams"". Well, 30 times 20 equals 600 not 300. So what do you get for the advertised price, 600 grams or only half as much? I asked this question two times last week, once by email and once by phone, yet I still have not received a response and I see no correction on the website. I want to buy, I just need to know what I am getting."
Perfect!,"This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old ""My K-cup"" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says ""some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this ""work around"" for the time being.""  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more ""hole down the middle"" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!"
Always delicious,"One word to describe this oatmeal is ""PERFECTION"" lol no need to say anything else. :) lOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!"
AH-MAZING!!,"WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!"
Yummy memory of the past,I live in the USA now but grew up in Canada.  We used to buy the Camel brand in small cans in Canada.  So I was so excited to find these on amazon.  They tasted great and were in perfect sized portions and every bit as good as I remembered.  I also thought the price was AWESOME as it included shipping.  I even bought some and sent it to my sister
For The Cat,My cat has never turned up his nose at this product. He always has his choice at meal time and he eats both the chicken and this product without fail.
Deliciously Tart & Tangy - Heaven on Toast!,"Robertson's are famous for their (orange) Golden Shred marmalade but I've always been more of a fan of the lesser-known lemon version, Silver Shred as I prefer the tart, tangy flavor of lemons to the gentler sweetness you get with oranges. This stuff is amazing on toast made with really good bread, and even better in my opinion if the toast has been allowed to cool and then slathered in a really good butter like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00289S3X2"">Beurre d'Isigny</a> or even <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CC1FM8"">Kerrygold</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EGNGK"">President</a> before spooning on the marmalade. As its name suggests, Silver Shred contains a fair amount of real shredded lemon peel which I know some aren't so fond of, but if you're among the ""not fond"" crowd, it's easy enough to avoid those bits or pick them out and just stick to the mouthwatering lemony jelly. Heavenly stuff!"
Heaven in Manhattan,"These are the best ever! Once you've tried these little morsels of heaven, you'll never settle for anything less in your Manhattans. I'm addicted!"
Mini Cookies with Mini Merits,"These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original ""Chips Ahoy!"" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes."
Ideal diet for a Rhodesian Ridgeback,"This is the only food our 12 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback has ever eaten (plus a single square of Kraft American cheese daily as a treat and a few chicken breast treats.)  Kramer is in great health and people are always amazed at how fit and strong he is.  That he still has all his teeth is surely attributable to the Active Care hard kibble diet and the near absolute lack of any signs of arthritis must be one of the benefits of the ""healthy joint formula.""  Both Kramer and I cannot recommend Active Care highly enough."
GREAT BONSAI,I love bonsai's..but can't remember how many arrived in lousy condition and died a fast death...This came packaged properly with not even one leaf missing...Was told it only needs room light..not sun..and in three days new leafs are coming out..Great looking planter pot also..I want another one..I'll wait a while just cause I can't believe how great it's doing..
Nestle's Fat Free for Me,I start each day with a cup of hot chocolate.  I worried that this product was discontinued because I couldn't find it for some time.  But happily it became available again and I ordered enough to last a while.  I like the way it tastes and love the fact that it is like 30 calories per serving.  The low calorie count gives me more reasons to keep using it.
Yum yum,"These are not soft shortbread cookies but Krunchy with a hint of butter. Great for t2 diabetics but, as you know, anything we eat moderation is key. Although pricey buying a case [12] is a lot cheaper than buying single packs retail at your local grocer."
Oh so good!!!,"Easily makes great beignets! Plus I was surprised to find it made more than I expected even though I like my beignets somewhat doughy. I roll my dough out a little less to have thicker dough.<br />If you have not made these before, to make them puff you have to hold them under the oil for a few seconds. After you drop them in and they start to rise to the top, just use something to hold them just under the oil. It usually takes just a second or so and you will see the dough start to expand. Then just let them go and let them finish cooking. Flip to cook both sides if necessary."
"Pretty Shady, Amazon","No, I love these crackers.  I buy 'em all the time and they're pretty plain, but high quality and that cracked pepper gives a nice bit of zip to the taste that just makes it that much better.<br /><br />This SHOULD be a 5 star review; packaging was great, no crackers broken in the couple of boxes I've opened as of yet.  Just not too bad at all<br /><br />EXCEPT<br /><br />The order that I placed on May 8, 2007 came packed with 12 boxes of crackers that all expire on June 30, 2007.<br /><br />I've yet to see a single box of these crackers in the local stores with such an early expiration date.<br /><br />The nice price and the free shipping was quickly compromised by Amazon taking a batch of crackers with a short shelf life and pushing them on special.  In the end, the loser is me.  When calling Amazon with the hopes of a fair exchange or something a little reasonable, there was no flexibility.<br /><br />Lesson learned by me and a forewarning to others:  Take caution purchasing perishables from Amazon.<br /><br />Shame on you, Amazon."
No more subscribe and save?,"Love this cereal, unfortunately no longer seems to be sold directly by Amazon with subscribe and save, just some overpriced alternatives."
Not very tasty,"It may be that I am not used to the taste  of Stevia as compared with Splenda, but I did not care for this.  Also, it wouldn't dissolve in the water.  I wouldn't buy it again."
"Great rice, why has haiga doubled in price?","This is a nice compromise between white and brown rice.  Some people call it brown and it isn't.  It is white with a little bran left, actually the germ.<br /><br />I think it might be a little better than consuming totally white rice and the taste is fine so I like using it.  However, the price doubled from the last time I got it (not just here, it is hard to find on net and I don't have a lot of asian stores here to look into)<br /><br />It is grown in California and if Calrose, etc, hasn't experienced some price doubling disaster I don't know why this has.<br /><br />But the rice itself is perfectly fine and perhaps a little better than straight white."
Love it but the price is holding me back from ordering more...,"I am in love with Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink! Just a squeeze or two (or three, however much you want!) in a nice glass of water and you have yourself a super tasty energy drink with no carbs, no sugars, just energy and tastiness!<br />I also like the fact that you don't need a spoon to mix it, just the act of squeezing the product into the glass does a fantastic job at mixing it.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor reminds me of Hawaiian Punch almost, which I love, but without the gobs of sugar. No weird or funky aftertaste or anything!<br /><br />However at about 25¢+ per squeeze, I find it a bit too rich for my taste. Some Kool-Aid and zero calorie sweetener can make a similar tasting drink for MUCH less (and without the taurine and caffeine).<br /><br />If it was just a little bit cheaper, I'd be buying a truck load for the summer... but for now I'll just be sticking with plain ol' water."
Good with some modifications,"I was sick of eggs. And sick of cornflakes. So when I spotted the Pancake mix from Bob's, I had to try it. Like all of their products, it was really easy to make - just like any pancake mix. The first batch I made, however, were... well, let's say ""Dense."" I was feeding a guest, who clutched his throat and asked for liquid to wash it down. But I didn't think they were THAT bad, considering the wheat free sludge I'd engaged before. So, I drowned mine in maple syrup and thought it was quite tasty.<br /><br />The next time, I tried modifying the recipe a bit with fruit - fresh blueberries to be exact. And those came out a lot moister and less dense. Mmm... blueberry pancakes... wonderful! I've tried other fruit, tossed in applesauce once... and each time, I got interesting twists on much moister pancakes.<br /><br />I still don't eat them often -- just when I'm having a ""help, I can't eat another egg"" moment. Actually, they are good as part of a big brunch, with an egg over easy on top. Since can't eat bread with my eggs, it takes the place of toast.<br /><br />I've wondered if whipping these frothy with a beater might help but haven't tried it yet. All in all, they're tasty, if a little thick, very filling and easy to whip up."
licorice chips,"I ordered these because my father recently gave me one when we were visiting. I asked where he got them, and he told me the price, which seemed scary, but then he said he had had the bag for about 25 years, and still had some left (and they tasted fresh to me). I figured a product that could last that long, while being used (frugally, I suspect) and still be beneficial must be worth the premium price.<br /><br />I received the product on time, and I am not disappointed with it. I expect this bag may last me awhile, although I may share more of it with others. the chips have good flavor, are long-lasting, and soothing to the throat."
We're both happy at long last!,"I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken ""in meaty juices"" (it HAS to be the ""in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I"">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y"">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the pât&eacute; kind, I.e. ""in meaty juices"" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based ""in meaty juices"" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft pât&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar ""in nearby juices"" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have."
Yum,Love these... Only takes 1 chip to satisfy the<br />* need for cheese*<br />Good price and the packaging retains freshness.
very tasty herbal tea,"I have always purchased this tea in tea bags.....however, never again.  The loose tea is stronger, richer, and if you add sweetener and whole milk, the tea is raised to dessert status.  It's strongly flavored with cinnamon and other herbs and spices.  This makes for  great mouth feel along with a high satisfaction factor.  Most of the time I enjoy a large mug of tea before going to bed. It relaxes me and I sleep very well, or have an afternoon cup for break.  This tea has moved up to my favorite herbal tea and second only to my morning cup of black tea.  I whole-heartedly recommend it, and for that matter, any and all Davidson's teas.  (No, I don't work there, but their outlet store is five miles away and they have wonder gift items.)  Catalog is available on-line."
Fabulous for frying!,This is the most favorful coconut oil on the market.  I am really pleased with it's performance in the  skillet.  Try frying shrimp in it!  You won't be disappointed!  Even the house smells good afterwards.<br />Highly recommend!
LOVE THEM!  NATURAL!!! HEALTHY!!!!,"Want a quick snack that is healthy?  I have tried the multigrain, lime and chocolate chips.  EXCELLENT-E.  Why on earth do the grocery stores not sell these?  EXCELLENT."
Goodniks Sesame Oat Bran Sticks,These are delicious!  They are saltier than potato chips but more filling.  They came nicely packaged and were very fresh.  Anyone who enjoys sesame stick treats will like these!
quick lunch,These little cans of tuna spread are great for a snack or the start of a quick lunch.  The flavor and texture are good.  Keep a few of these cans and some crackers in your desk and you'll be set for those busy days at work.
Horsetail Grass Tea,Too early to know.  I was recommended that this product helps out the joints.  I have been enjoying the tea going on one week.
A superior coffee,"I am rather hard to please with 'straight' (unflavored) coffee.  I don't like any bitterness, nor too strong a taste, but yet want a rich coffee flavor that can stand up to a large mug.  I've found this Kenyan AA to have all the qualities that make a satisfying morning coffee.  To me, it tastes like really good coffee is supposed to.  I've tried many types of K cup coffees and this is always the one I come back to.  I enjoy flavored coffees for later in the day, but my first morning cup needs to be 'pure' and to me, this is as pure and rich as it comes.  If it were wine, it would be called smooth and full-bodied.  If it were chocolate, it would be semi-sweet.  In fact, it reminds me of chocolate because of the roundness of its flavor.<br /><br />For those who like 'rocket fuel' type coffee, this will seem too mild, but to the coffee drinker who prefers medium or even light roast coffee and wants something deeply satisfying, this really fits the bill.<br /><br />Now, if only Amazon would sell it in those big 'frustration free' boxes.  I'd sure buy it.  Highly recommended."
Delicious!,"I don't know what the other person is talking about, these nuts are delicious!  Granted they're not your organic, all natural stuff, but what did you expect from a fusion buffalo wing almond!"
Delicious,"Great product! These snack bars total only 110 calories and keep you full till your next meal. The first time I tried these, I found it difficult to believe I wasn't eating candy. If you're trying to lose weight or if you just want a healthier alternative to your daily candy fix, this is the item for you."
Excellent Taste and High Protien,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FDC2I2"">Orgain Organic Sweet Vanilla Bean, 11-Ounce Container (Pack of 12)</a> I would like to say that this product taste really good. I have tried other products and this is far better than anything we have tried. High in protein 16 grams. This is helping my recovery by adding extra protein to my diet. I will buy this again."
Quite Good. Nice and Fresh and Flavorful.,"We always keep a supply of cereal bars around for our little boy (4 years old). His eating can be somewhat erratic  and there are times when I don't think he's getting enough to eat and he refuses to eat anything else. Well, I can almost always get him to eat a good cereal bar. I've bee using the Fresh and Easy bars and they're quite good and the boy likes them. Well, this time, they had a small display of Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bars and they were on a deep discount sale. I bought a couple including this blueberry variety. The bars are quite good. Nice and fresh and flavorful. They certainly didn't last long with the boy. They'll do. Nice mix of ingredients too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
Nice smooth taste,Good value but more importantly it taste really good.  Well worth the premium over store bought.
Cafe Essentials Mocha Java,"If you like a mocha ""shake"", I'd recommend mixing a scoop with chocolate or vanilla protein powder, add a little milk or water with ice cubes, and it's a treat!"
Good bulk tea,"I went looking for cheap bulk tea, and I found it. Quality is pretty good - if you over-steep it, it gets a little bitter. A good choice for some every-day tea."
canceling my shipment,"I order the 192 box of these every month.  I'll get them the same time of the month for a couple of months and then they send me an email that they have canceled my order due to payment problem and I have to reorder and loose a month.  I don't understand since I havent changed my address, card number or anything. Does anyone else have this problem?"
NO TASTE OR FLAVOR -BAD CHOICE,MY DAUGHTER & I BOTH ENJOY PUMPKIN SPICE COFFEE.  SAW IT AT BED BATH & BEYOND.  PURCHASED A BOX FOR $12.89.  HAD IT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.  NO FLAVOR WHAT SO EVER.  I WON'T BE PURCHASING AGAIN.
Good Stuff,This is good quality jerky like the trade shows.  If you are jerky enthusiast like myself you won't be disappointed.  Very good quality meat.  My only complaint if I can find one would be it's a little light on the flavor for me.  I prefer the maple pepper for a spicier flavor.
NOT Gluten Free !,"The ingredients say: Bacon Type Flavor (Hydrolyzed Corn Soy Wheat Gluten Protein,<br /><br />So this is NOT GLUTEN FREE and is mis-categorized"
Excellent,"I'd love to know the kind of bars the first reviewer eats; because they must be some amazing bars! My entire office loves the Nugo bars. They are actually made a few doors down the street from my office. I think the coffee bars, chocolate blast, and banana bars are the best. Peanutbutter pleasers are good as well. I recommend them. I've had many of the regular store bought brands and find these to be more chocolaty and delicious. Good luck!"
Great Brand but...,"This stuff is amazing! Doggie love's the green one (apples) the orange ones also. This is red so the dye in it can make your dog's stool darker in color / almost black. We freaked out the first time thinking he had blood in his stool but it's the dye. It is quite large so only give this to your dog if he is a larger breeder or larger puppy that's finished teething. FYI : this took 4-5 days to ship to me and I did pay shipping even though I had in my cart more than $25 worth of product. This is the smaller box. They offer this in a larger box. Very good, and great ingredients. Just read the label for the size and weight of product."
Cheez-Its,"I send these to my son at College every so often.  With 3 boxes, he can share with others on his dorm floor."
AWESOME,Probably the best beef jerky I've ever had!  The country cut is just so moist and flavorful.  If you like beef jerky it is a must try for anyone!
weird smell,"This sauce kind of has a weird unappetizing smell. It smelled bad while it was cooking.  I was able to eat the chicken I made only by masking the taste of the sauce with a lot of basmati rice.  Maybe the smell is just something I don't like, but I would not buy this product again.  The texture of the sauce was fine however."
Saturated Fat AND Sodium,These products may have no trans fat but are LOADED with SODIUM and SATURATED FAT. This package contains 1.5g or 8% Saturated Fat.  And 610mg or 25% Sodium.  BEWARE.
Size matters!,"I saw the tower on line and it looked like a great deal. I have been sending Harry an David gift boxes as Christmas gifts for years and this seemed like a great value just from looks. I had a bad address and consequently had one delivered to my house and discovered that I had sent out three Barbie sized boxes of candy to all of my friends. It is true that the buyer should beware but deception only works once with me and I will never place an order with this company, Broadway Basketeers."
Celestial Seasonings Caffeine-Free Herb Tea,"This is excellent natural Caffeine-Free herb tea.  It is easy to make. Just place 6 bags in a quart of cold water, place in refrigerator for 3-4 hours and it is ready to drink.  Great flavor.  I serve it daily."
Great Taste and Reasonably Priced,"I personally don't like strong coffee.  If you like weaker coffee, then this blend is a great choice for you.  Other reviews on here say that its too weak, which is probably true if your used to something strong.<br /><br />I also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste. For the price, it can't hurt to give it a try."
Tastes like tea,This is an awful coffee. The flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee.
Not enough flavor for me,"I think there is a big difference between minced anchovy filling for an olive and a whole anchovey filling.  The minced variety like this brand do not have the robust flavor of whole anchovies.  The minced ones are not bad and are actually a lot easier to find, but I definitely prefer the whole anchovy variety."
convenience packs ROCK!,"I'm writing about the single serving convenience packs, offered in a 24-count case, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLX6"">Walkers Shortbread Fingers, 2-Count Cookies Packages (Pack of 24)</a>, which are also available with Subscribe and Save.  They're amazing!  Here's why:<br /><br />1  Yes, as everyone says, these Walker cookies are exceptional.  You may think it's all just buzz, but if you haven't tried them, don't judge us as silly until you do (!).<br /><br />2  But what happens if you open a box -- you finish it, right!  BAD.  These little suckers aren't the greatest thing for you, to put it mildly.<br /><br />3  Answer:  single serving packaging!!  It really works.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I'd always have a box on hand in case of unexpected guests -- at least, I'd think I had one, but the box would usually have disappeared unexpectedly whenever I went to look for it.  True confessions:  I love them too and was occasionally looking to sneak some for myself!  So having them around just in case was a bad, BAD idea.  But a case of 24 packs of 2 cookies per package is ideal.  Two seems to satisfy my husband's craving -- he almost never takes more than one packet.  And I open a packet occasionally and make 2 cookies last 2 days, instead of a whole box lasting almost forever and my worrying that they'd go stale or attract ants.<br /><br />Bonus:  they're easily packable!  When my husband's expecting an exceptionally tough day at work, I'll usually sneak a pack into his lunch if he hasn't already appropriated one for himself.<br /><br />And when he's especially wiped out at the end of an unusually demanding day, a pack of these really seems to perk him up and help him muster strength for tomorrow.  He brings it upstairs while he's watching TV and waits a while before opening the bag and savoring his treasure.  Whether for lunch or after dinner, the gleam in his eye as he talks about how wonderful it is to have a treat when he's so stressed means a lot to me, especially when I know he's only eating in moderation instead of wolfing down ten or twenty servings at a time.  The case of 24 has lasted us 3 months already -- a pleasant surprise, given that there are 2 addicts in the house.  :  So our portion-control strategy is working!!!<br /><br />And yes, when we had guests who chose after-dinner tea, these were just the right thing to bring out with it, and I didn't mind opening multiple packs at once and putting the cookies together on 1 plate for serving, knowing that I wasn't either spoiling an entire box, or promoting too rapid consumption of it, just by providing our guests with a few.<br /><br />I wish two other treasures came in single-serving packets:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S"">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8WI1Q"">Mary's Gone Crackers, Caraway, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>!!<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED."
Tasty Treat,"The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it."
Awesome dip!,"My office received a jar of this dip in a gift basket, and I was immediately hooked. It has a wonderful blend of sweet, hot and tangy flavors that I can't even begin to describe. One of my coworkers absconded with most of the full jar (before I had a chance to!) so now I'm on a hard target search for my own supply"
Wow!,"The reviews are right on. This stuff is amazing. Tastes just like peanut butter from a  jar, only it's less greasy. I run frozen bananas through our juicer to make 'soft serve' and sprinkle/stir this in and the result is awesome!! I've had it on a sandwich with Nutella and that was outstanding too. I don't think I could ever go back to regular PB again. This packaging is a little awkward, once I cut it open, I put it in a plastic container to stay fresh. There is no resealing the package."
"great product, just a bit",on the sweet side. We poor gluten intolerant people are used to some draw backs - so 4 stars for it.
"Great Coffee, Great Price","Amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite, I could not resist.  Great purchase."
Kitty and I both love it!,"Our 6 year old cat has been eating this food exclusively since we transitioned him from the Science Diet kitten food he was eating at the shelter before we got him.  We simply leave food out for him at all times, and this food makes up 99% of his diet (outside of a few bites of bacon here and there).  Once he reached adulthood, his weight has not varied more than a few ounces either way from a very healthy (for his overall size) 10lbs.  Our vet says that the long-term maintenance of a healthy weight is one of the surest signs of a good diet in adult cats.  He has a VERY healthy and shiny looking coat, is very energetic, and has very few gastrointestinal issues.  Plus, you get the added bonus of all the good the Newman's Own Foundation does.  Couldn't be happier!!"
CET Hygiene chews,"Both my chihuahuas will only chew on these briefly, but don't go all out, which probably means the CET chews won't help with plaque build-up. Luckily I can brush the teeth of the little one. The other, larger one won't allow me to brush his teeth, but he eats a Greenie every day and his teeth are better than they were without them."
no crash,The drink wasn't bad tasting and I did not notice a smell. Gave me energy I am sure because of the caffeine. It doesn't have as much caffeine as some other products out there...some products do not even tell you how much caffeine is their product-At least they are attempting to disclose how much caffeine is in their drink_ that is what I like about it the caffeine is low...I will try it gain like the chews or powder...
"Not bad, but not great either.","This coffee is slightly above the quality of the big grocery store cans (maybe not quite as good as Yuban) but not really what I expect from ""gourmet"" bagged coffee. The cinnamon flavor is very mild, and the coffee itself is also very mild tasting, but slightly acidic."
Great-Tasting way to take vitamins,"Taste great, texture for chewing is terrific.  These are not as sweet as jelly beans or gummy bears, but taste good nonetheless.  Kids might think they're candy, so probably best to keep them in a safe place; they probably won't overdose on vitamins, but it makes for some pretty expensive candy!"
Bag arrived opened.,"Delighted that the shipment arrived one day early, but disappointed when I opened the box and discovered the bag had arrived already opened. There was Farro all over the bottom of the box.<br /><br />When I went to the Amazon website, I learned that this item is not eligible for return. There was no link to contact the shipper or the supplier for a replacement.<br /><br />I am hoping this review will generate a response from someone. I will upgrade the review to five stars when this issue is resolved. I would like a new bag of Farro, please."
WARNING $25+ For One Bag,"After confirming that the receipt of ONE BAG was not an error, I was able to get a partial credit."
"My toddler still loves these now that he's a ""big boy""!","I started using these when my son was about 10 months old and stuck with them because they're organic, they have actual greens in them (amazing!) and HE LOVES THEM! Now that he's 2, he still asks for them. Who am I to argue?"
awesome product!,"If you want soft skin, shiny hair, strong bones, good digestion and something that tastes great, you will want to buy this!  And, as a side benefit, I have lost 4 lbs in just two weeks by eating 1 tbsp a half hour before meals."
my puppy loves them!,"My patterdale terrier loves these chew sticks. They keep him occupied for awhile, depending on how hungry he is. They smell nice (considering they are dog treats of course!) and aren't overly hard like some chews. Give them a try!"
Birthing Miracle Tea,"I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery."
My dog's absolute favorite treat!  Pet 'n Shape Sweet Potatos,"When these come by mail, my dog knows the package is for him, and he tears it apart getting it open.  We typically order four or five different treats at the same time and this is the one he opens first! He absolutely loves these and it seems like anything from Pet 'n Shape is on the healthy side."
"""Kraft Food With Planters Peanut Butter Will Give The Others A Run For Their Money""","Distributed by Kraft Foods Global Inc we have ""PLANTERS CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER"" (16.3oz), packed with six jars, which Amazon sent my way through the Vine Program.<br /><br />* 1st -- This is a very creamy and smooth product, which is on the plus side.<br />* 2nd -- The quality is certainly up there with other brands, maybe a little higher. Just unscrew the lid and take a whiff and smell fresh peanuts.<br />* 3rd -- Most importantly is the taste, with a flavor that will satisfy your taste buds, nuff said.<br /><br />Reminds me of my days growing up with all the good natural foods that Grandma use to serve.<br /><br />My Grandchildren Tommy and Ava live with me and my wife (Judy), we gave it the taste test<br />with our regular brand and Planters passed with flying colors.<br /><br />Each member of my family use this with snacks, on celery, apples and of course Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches,<br />so we gave it the works and Planters came up a Winner!<br /><br />In closing - My Entire Family - Highly recommends."
EXCELLENT product!!!,"I LOVE these vanilla beans!!!! Very fresh, very fragrant - and what a great price: 16 beans for almost $10! When you go to a grocery store (or to a fancy ""Williams Sonoma""), they sell 2 measly vanilla beans for 8+ bucks, it's ridiculous.<br />I highly recommend these vanilla beans, they are well worth the money. You'll love it."
Not too sweet,"I love the convenience of the single serve pouches and the honey/mango/pineapple flavor is good.  It isn't too sweet or artificial tasting.  However, one packet provides a fairly strong flavor so I prefer to use more water than is recommended, which just means that it is a better value than other drink mixes."
Great Product.,I bought this item unsure if my dogs would like it. Not only do they like it they love it. One of my dogs never plays with toys and I have a hard time getting him away from this toy.
not good,"I like water but sometimes I need a little bit of flavor diversity.  I tend to turn to Crystal Light or my water infuser to vary my drink selection.  I was excited to try the MIO Liquid.  MIO seemed like an easy way to make a beverage that had the perfect amount of flavoring.  Unfortunately, I found this beverage to be lacking.<br /><br />Some notes on this product:<br /><br />Flavor: Do you like jello?  That is what I felt like I was drinking.  The liquefied version of some jello that I would not classify as peach or tea inspired. It tasted highly artificial and would not be a beverage that I would offer to a family member or friend to quench their thirst on a hot day.<br /><br />Color: The color was orange.  It did not resemble tea and had the appearance of jello.<br /><br />Ease of use:  I found this product to be burdensome.  It is messy and I would never let a young child use this product.  The product cannot be squirted at even a slight angle because it will splatter - clothes, the floor, hands - and stain.  I was so disgusted when I first used this product and some of the product splattered onto my white vinyl floor and left huge stains.  I had to scrub the floor multiple times for the MIO stains to fade.<br /><br />Health impact:  I tried drinking this stuff twice and on both occasions I developed headaches.  I do develop migraines after consumption of certain foods and beverages but usually the food/beverage culprits contain caffeine or chocolate.<br /><br />Packaging: MIO is packaged in a #7 plastic. #7 plastics are the most difficult type of plastic to recycle. Unless you live in a really progressive place that accepts #7 plastics, the product packaging will have to be pitched.<br /><br />In sum, I cannot recommend MIO.  The product stains flooring, does not taste like tea, possibly causes headaches, and is packaged in a plastic that is difficult to recycle.<br /><br />.000001 stars out of 5"
"Nescaf&eacute; Dolce Gusto Brewers, Vanilla Latte Macchiato","This flavor is ok bur it is not my favorite of all the dolce gusto flavors. It has a faint vanilla flavor that I wish would be a little stronger, similiar to the mocha or caramel latte maccchiato. Still, it is pretty good and the milk still foams up well."
I'm Loven The Mount Hagen!,This is by far the best instant coffee I have ever tasted!  And the individual packages are ingenuous~ I can take my coffee anywhere and everywhere right in my purse! What can you say in a review for coffee?  You've Gotta Try It! Its worth the money and its ORGANIC!
Have been using Maxwell House for longer than we care to say.,"Excellent blend - uses less to get the full flavored taste.  Makes great pot of Iced Coffee also - where many others leave a nasty taste in mouth.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4BOHK"">Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Buy using Amazon's great 'Subscribe & Save*' one can match the Grocery store prices."
Small tree,"I really should have read the dimensions, it is really small and it looks like someone cut a branch off a bush. I hope it stays alive. I had one I bought from a road side vendor that was like this one and it died in a month. I had one from a florist that lived for years. I was hoping for better quality."
Doesn't get much better,"I was pet sitting recently and the dog I was sitting for had these in her treat pouch. She loved them so I tried them with my dogs. All 3 dogs were quite well-behaved whenever they saw me reach for these goodies. My son and I jokingly call them ""doggie crack"". They're good for them, they work as training tools, what else can you ask for in a dog treat?"
Fresh and delicious,"My two cats will eat anything. So why do I even care what they eat? I care because it's about their health and it's a important responsibility I accepted when I adopted them. This Wellness Canned food is very fresh and (according to the experts) has all the healthy nutrition cats need. I've tried a few different brands and this one gives my cats the best soft, full coat and even makes their poop smell less (super bonus!). It's pricier, but give it a shot."
Rubbish,"Totally not worth paying for. Even my kids hated this stuff. Very cheap cocoa in tiny tiny tins for too much money. I could have gone out and bought twice as much Swiss Miss, and enjoyed that a whole lot more."
A good buy,"When these came, they were super fresh and tasty. Even after a few weeks, they still are good quality and I enjoy eating them. 3.5 lbs is a lot!! So plan accordingly. A normal size bag you buy is 2 ounces, a pound is 16, so you can think of this equalling 28 bags of swedish fish."
I love it....great taste,"I received what I ordered faster than expected, item was in great condition...I love the strong taste of this coffee. I will definitely buy this item again."
The best!,I can't believe such good olive oil is produced in the US.  I don't bother with expensive imports any longer.  This is a real family making a quality product in the US that is superior to any other olive oil I've tasted...at any price.
Brown sugar can't get more real than this,"I've tasted a lot of underprocessed, raw, or natural sugars, and chewed on sugar cane in my day, so I think I know what I like: something that tastes like dried sugar cane juice.  One taste, and I'm pretty convinced this is the real thing, authentic top-shelf brown sugar in convenient, attractive cube form.  Does take a little stirring to dissolve, but if it didn't I would be highly suspicious!"
Dog snack,"My dogs eat this product every day, and I rather other the pack of three because I have 4 dogs.  Thanks again Amazon."
Jack Links is the best!,"Jack Links is really good one of the bests and its actually real meat haha,I dont have to pay for it I get it for free because my dads company sells it and he gets free stuff from them all the time but if I didnt get it for free I would pay full price for it!"
"Bland , wimpy coffee",Tried this based on positive reviews. Very disappointed. Just slightly better(and more expensive) than grocery store coffee. Lavazza should be sued for false advertising for putting the word gusto on the package! I will go sprinting back to my BOLD Starbucks and happily pay the modest difference!
Best gluten-free pretzels,"These pretzels are so good - so much like the ""real thing"" for those of us who cannot eat gluten -(wheat,barley,rye and oats).  We recommend them highly!"
Tasty!,"I love Arizona iced tea, and this one is quite tasty, especially for a diet version.  A great combination of lemony tea.<br /><br />Please note that this review is specific to the product, not the price or the merchant."
Wow - Very Tasty,"Wow !!  This is the most delicious cinnamon I have ever tasted.<br /><br />There are two types of cinnamon - Cassia (Cinnamomum aromaticum, found in most supermarkets) and Ceylon ( Cinnamomum verum - also called true cinnamon).<br /><br />This is Organic Ceylon (True) Cinnamon which is  tastier, of  finer texture, and healthier than Cassia.<br /><br />Great for flavoring tea, yogurt, etc. or for medicinal anti-inflammatory treatment.<br /><br />This is three 2 ounce packages - but is also offered in one six ounce package.  Amazon should stock this item!"
Our six cats vote for Fancy Feast,"We have four, and are feeding two feral cats who live somewhere in the forest here.  I'm ashamed to admit that I feed what my other cats don't finish, to the feral cats, but they are all very happy, and there is no waste.<br /><br />I'm so happy with the ones I get every month, through subscriptions.  They are cheaper, have free shipping, and it's so nice not to have to remember, when I drive the fifty miles round trip to the nearest grocery store, to get cat food.<br /><br />The only other wet food my cats eat is Tiki Cat.  They also like A Taste Of The Wild dry food, in the venison and salmon flavor only."
Melted and Unusable,"I had ordered these chocolate covered raisins for our wedding candy ""bar"".  When we got it, it was completely melted and wouldn't even come out of the container because it melted together.  All of the chocolates turned gray and they were completely unusable.  We were very dissapointed!"
Green Mountain Fair Trade Colombian,The coffee arrive on time and the quality was as good as always.  I have ordered this product several times and it has always been as advertised.  I will order it again in the future.
Too delicious for salsa,"Julio's chips are outstanding. They are thinner, crispier and more delicate than most tortilla chips.  However, it's the slightly spicy seasoning that will make you reach over and over for just one more chip."
Travel Must Have.,This is a travel must have for my Chocolate Lab Lizzy. As soon as she is in the back of the SUV and the engine is started she is looking for her chew. These chews keep her busy and occupied.
Be very careful!,"Review of Asian Taste Dried Mushroom, 5-Ounce (Pack of 34), Price: $12.00 ($0.07 / oz)<br /><br />The title is Asian Taste Dried Mushroom, 5-Ounce (Pack of 34), but they mean 34 mushrooms in one pack instead of 34 packs of it. And in fact, there is only 32 mushrooms in one bag. So the price is $12 ($2.4/oz). The price is crazy expensive. And the quality of this product is just fair.<br />Do not buy this one. You can get very good dried mushrooms @ reasonable price from amazon."
"Strong, great-tasting","We really enjoy this coffee and have gotten hooked on it.  It is strong and has a clean taste, no bitter after taste like some coffees and it's a great way to start the morning."
"Not as hard as I was expecting, but my guys love them!","I've never given my dogs real pig ears, so I don't know how tough they are, but I assume they are like rawhide.<br />Instead of gnawing on Better than Ears for a long time, they eat them pretty fast.<br />Not a problem, just not what I expected.<br />Man, do they go crazy over these things. But then again...who can resist bacon flavor?"
Good Stuff,5 hour energy is great stuff when you work nights and have to stay up.
Huge disappointment,"I love black bean soups of all types, but this is the first perfectly awful recipe I've ever encountered.  First of all many additional ingredients are required (whole purple onion, quart of chicken broth, orange juice) and it is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to produce.  The seasoning packet is way too heavy on the cumin, which I think is a Tex-Mex aberration.  There are almost as many black eye peas in the bag as black beans and they don't taste the same.  The final result is that the potentially lovely black bean taste is completely overwhelmed by the cumin and orange juice.  The soup just taste funny.  I've got three remaining bags to give away. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NGATQA"">Frontier Soups Hearty Meals Texas Wrangler Black Bean Soup, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>"
Soy protein vs Whey Protein,"I thought I would like the taste of Soy protein as I have eaten a lot of soy protein bars. After having tasted this vs whey protein, the whey protein tasts much better. There are 5grams of protein in one tablespoonful of this product, and it is hard to mask the taste of it, even with flavor drops, and splenda. I have found other products to give me 20grams of protein in one of their scoops, which the flavor can be masked a lot better."
New Orleans Coffee,I tried Emeril's Big Easy Bold for Keurig and found it to be a top coffee with strong taste and flavor.
great teriyaki sauce,Found this was the best sauce to have with salmon. Try marinating the salmon with a little of the sauce beforehand and it gets even better. Love it!<br />FYI: We didn't like to Rub With Love Salmon seasoning; use this Teriyaki sauce instead.
Natural Calm,This is an amazing product. I had bought it years ago and really liked the way it made me feel. I lost contact with this brand and found it again and am back on it and feel great.
Not as good as regular coconut oil,"I've been using coconut oil for some years and I selected this in the Vine program because everything else I clicked on was not available.<br />It has an odd flavor, not like regular coconut oil and a gritty texture that I don't like, even when gently softened in warm water.<br />It did not blend smoothly into the cream soups that I have been preparing (with coconut oil) for some years.<br />I can't explain all the details of just why I don't like this product but it certainly does not live up to the hype.<br />I will stick with the regular organic, extra virgin coconut oil from the same producer.  It is a superior product and much more versatile than this ""Manna"""
Yeach,"Ok, yes, this particular whey protein doesn't contain artificial sweeteners or other stuff you don't want in your diet but it really tastes awful and I haven't found a satisfactory way to dress it up.  I tried putting it in my coffee...it just ruined my normally delicious cup of coffee.  I tried putting it in juice but I had to make the juice (from frozen) really concentrated to make it taste ok..and then it still smells awful.  Jarrows whey may be better than 30 others out there but it's still not good enough to make me happy to take it.  I always like it when other reviewers tell me what's a better option so here's my advice.  Buy a jug of Optimum Nutrition Solid Gold.  It has fake sweeteners which I don't like but it tastes really good in a glass of skim milk! I'll probably throw the rest of this Jarrows whey in the garbage (unless I figure out how to cook with it or something)."
Passed The Yellow Lab Test,"I am always a bit hesitant to give my dog new treats - as many are filled with fattening and bad ingredients.  These appear to be all natural, with the following ingredients:<br /><br />Organic Barley<br />Organic Lamb<br />Organic Carrots<br />Organic Apples<br />Organic Palm Oil<br />Organic Molasses<br /><br />They are large treats with a nice consistency, and my dog loves them, so it is a win / win: healthy treats she loves."
Great find,We've had a hard time finding this product in our area.  It's great I can get it shipped for free and still not pay a lot for the product.  We love these beans
Outstanding!,"Put simply, these chips are full of flavor, texture and lower in calories than your average potato chip. They have a slightly salty but still sweet flavor. There's great ""crunch"" due to the fact that they have rice flour in them. They are not greasy since they are NOT fried. The only criticism is that they do not offer any significant fiber, being that the sweet potato is mixed with rice flour. I will absolutely purchase these as an alternative to a potato chip or a tortilla chip, for snacking."
Bubbly,"I really enjoyed drinking Neuro Gasm! I was looking all over for it so when I found I had to try it out of curiosity. They say curiosity killed the cat, But SATISFACTION brought it back! Lets just say the results were very satisfactory. The bubbliness is fun too!!!! Yay BUBBLY!!!"
Small and not very tasty,"I did not like these lollipops.  They were MUCH smaller than I expected, and each pop has a ""made in china"" plastic wrapper on them.  Not great for a party, as most parents don't like to see MADE IN CHINA emblazoned on something they are going to feed their children, considering all of the issues with China and lead.  I'm not saying these have lead, but the packaging could have been a little more elegant."
Liver chiplets,"I have a pompoo and a yorkie.  They are spoiled, of course.  Every evening before bedtime, they must have their chiplet.  They love them."
My dog loves them but EXPENSIVE,"My dog is a mini Australian Shepherd and is pretty picky about his food.  He first tried these freeze dried Chicken Patties at his doggy daycare.  He ate it so quickly that I looked them up on Amazon and bought them!!  The package recommends feeding a few to several patties a day for your dog. At that rate, I'd be broke!  I give him maybe one or two every other day.  They are super light and powdery.  Many of mine broke during shipment so the whole bottom third of my package is in powdered bits. My dog takes the patties out of his dish one by one and carries them over to the carpet and proceeds to bite them into tiny pieces before eating them.  Luckily it's a powder so it vaccuums easily off of the carpet.  And even though it seems like they might be smelly, they aren't. They don't smell like much of anything.  The point is, it's a healthy and well made food that my dogs loves.  I feel really good about feeing him these patties.  I will have to try the other flavors as well.  I just wish they weren't so expensive and were a little more sturdy during shipment so I wouldn't receive a third of a bag of freeze dried powder!"
New twist on a favorite.,"Constant Comment tea has been an American favorite for over 70 years.  Bigelow Tea has added green tea to their line choices as well as decaffeinated.  Because my local grocery has dropped the shelf space for teas to a quarter of what they had a few years ago, Amazon provides fasts delivery and a lower price than I was paying."
Cattledogs love it!,"This is one great toy!  My busy, mouthy Cattledogs like it so much they will ask to play with it, sitting and staring at it on the shelf where it's stored.  When they first got the toy, it took them just a minute or two to get their mouths around the squirrel, but it took a couple days of play periods for them to figure out how to pull it out of the hole (it's a tight fit).  I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say, ""Go find"".  They love it, and will throw the ""stump"" around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.  All the  Kyjen toys are made for interactive play, but it's a point that must be stressed: these are not chew toys.  The other thing to keep in mind is the amount of dog slobber all that ""Go find"" spreads around.  You may want to confine the play to a room that is easily mopped."
The Cats Love 'Em. Only Two Calories Each.,"We have two cats (neutered males) and we feed them twice a day. Both have maintained proper weight, so they're getting what they need. Well, you'd never know it! They seem to always be hungry, day or night. What goes? I don't want to feed them again and get them to looking like Garfield. So, I got these Whiskas Temptations cat treats and I give them a few every now and them. Boy, do they go fast. The treats barely hit the dish and they're gone! Well, I notice they're only 2 calories per treat so they can't be doing much harm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"Sensation: liquid fruit cocktail, better than other aloe chunk drinks","The flavor was fine, like bright crisp apple juice with hint of green tea, sweet but not too sweet.  However, I didn't like the sensation of little soft bits of sweet stuff in my drink. To me it seemed like I was drinking some juice that had minced pieces of canned fruit cocktail in it.<br /><br />On the other hand, my daughter thought it was fine.  She said the pieces of aloe in this one were much better than other drinks she has tried with pieces of aloe.  In others, the pieces of aloe were larger and ""gushier, like pieces of snot"", so she liked this one better.<br /><br />I suppose it is a generational thing, not being enamored with bits in my drink.  But the flavor was good and not too sweet, much appreciated."
Very Bergamot-y Tea!,"****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****"
"Delicious, perfect snack size package, stays fresh","I love these cashews. They're Planters, so they taste great. These snack sized packages cost more than buying a larger container but they have three significant advantages that make the extra cost worth it to me: 1)Portion control. I only eat 1 ounce because I only eat what is in one packet. I like knowing that I'm only eating a 160 calorie snack. As healthy as nuts are, I really don't need to be eating more and I don't think I'd be as disciplined with a 16 ounce tub of cashews sitting between me and a television. 2)Freshness. I find that by the time I get towards the bottom of a larger container, the cashews are always soft to some extent. To make things worse, I find myself hurrying through the last of the container before they get even softer (so they taste worse and I'm eating more...) This won't happen when each ounce is individually sealed. 3)Portability. I'm not much of a take-my-food-with-me type of person, but if I'm hungry and in a rush to get out the door, grabbing a packet if these and an apple goes a long way. One other thing I like about these snack packets is that they open easily and down the long side of the packet, so the cashews inside are easy to get to. I ordered with 'subscribe and save' and enjoy having a pantry stable delivered to my door on a regular basis -- thanks Amazon!"
"Disappointed, this is not BOLD coffee","I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger."
will be buying again!,"I just put this in my cart because it was low-cost and I needed something to bring my total to $25 for the free shipping.  Well, the ploy worked - I bought it the first time AND I'll be buying it again.  I'm not nuts about coffee-flavored candy but I thought I'd give it a try.  Really good for when that I've-gotta-have-something-sweet in the afternoon hits."
Tastes like plastic,"I have owned a Keurig Machine for about 2 years.  I bought this the other day and brewed it and was SO disappointed, it tastes like the plastic container it came in.  I will never purchase this again. I will go back to the Oregon Chai. [...] It's probably simpler anyways."
Great Service,I ordered two of these to send to my grandmother and mother in law for mother's day.  It arrived earlier than expected and both of them were pleased with the flowers.  The plant arrived with flower buds ready to open and were packed well for delivery.  I will order from Giving plants again!
Awesome and Healthy!,"These chips were so yummy and super healthy.  I work in the fitness industry and I don't mind having a few of these chips with my sandwich for lunch or telling our clients about this great alternative to other ""snacks"" that are unhealthy.  This flavor is awesome and I can't wait to try more.  Thanks for filling my ""salty"" craving with something healthy!"
Very Pleased.,My spoiled kitty loves this food.  I like that this is grain free and the price is better than other brands.  The food is chunky but not to chunky and it looks better than most cat foods.  I would definitely recommend this food to other cat owners.
"Large sized cans, sealed for freshness - perfect!","I use a lot of olive oil in the kitchen - in Italian food, for dipping bread, and for frying. Olive oil contains healthy fats and antioxidants that can help fight heart disease and cancer.  Mantova Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes in a 3-liter can, and is sold in a two-pack with free SuperSaver Shipping.  Because the oil is sealed in a metal can, it stays fresher longer than olive oil sold in plastic containers.<br /><br />It has a light, fresh taste and a clean aroma that enhances every dish.  We especially like it for dipping - I add salt, oregano, garlic and cracked pepper to a dish of the oil, and we dip Italian bread in it.  It's one of our favorite appetizers.<br /><br />Olive oil is also wonderful for your hair and skin.  It absorbs quickly and isn't sticky.  I also add a tablespoon of olive oil to our cat's and dog's food, to improve digestion and make their coats shiny.  I've gotten to the point that I never buy canola, corn or sunflower oil anymore - olive oil is only a little more expensive and is so much better for us.<br /><br />If you're looking for extra virgin olive oil, Mantova is a great brand.  The two large containers will last a long time if kept in a cool, dark place like a pantry."
First Baby Food Used,"This was the packaged baby food I gave to my son, and it is his favorite.  It may be a little tart, but it is cute to see his reaction each time I put a spoonful in his mouth.  I like that this is organic and has DHA in it.  I have gotten several other flavors for my son, but this seems to be his favorite."
No Discernable Chocolate Flavor,"I ordered this with high hopes, given all the good reviews.  But unfortunately I have to agree with A Consumer that this product doesn't seem to have any chocolate flavor at all.  I had received a sample of another brand that was delicious but expensive, and I bought this hoping for a cheaper alternative but I guess it's true.  You get what you pay for."
omg so fabulous!,smooth thin creamy wafers! they didn't last long. it's a great gift or for personal consumption ;)i've bought these chocolates a few times over. i love them.
Doesn't last long for agressive chewers,I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.
Mesa Sunrise Gluten Free Cereal,"This is the most nutritious gluten free cereal I have found! I buy it in lots of six ecopacks, and I am never out of it."
Sodium Benzoate is Dangerous- It's in EZ sweetz,"I was disappointed to find out EZ-sweet uses Sodium Benzoate as one of it's preservatives. This ingredient, when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) creates Benzene which is carcinogenic (cancer causing).<br /><br />I used to use Splenda or generic sucralose packets, but they made a mess on the counter, took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk, and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners. EZ sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic. I had to find a better option. I find that the only super easy way around using EZ sweet but also save on space/mess is to use the splenda mini tablets. They are pricey and will cost a lot more than the packets, so I've recently found another option. I can now purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the Splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water to make the equivalent of 2,500 packets of Splenda. The cost of the 1oz powder is only $24.95. I found that other companies sell sucralose powder and if you buy a lot of it, it's even cheaper. I don't know how I would measure out 1oz to make a 4 oz bottle of sweetener solution so, for me, it's just easier to get 1oz, it will last us a while and the 4oz bottle on the coffee counter doesn't take up much space at all. I'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives (colloidal silver, GSE, natural salts, citric acid) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus. If you're going to go this route, do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one you love, please leave a comment to this review.<br /><br />Note: I was lucky that the splendex company agreed to give me a 4oz bottle to use for my sucralose solution, I'm not sure if they would do that for everyone. If not, just keep your old EZ squeeze bottle or find a nice dropper bottle that will do the job without making a mess. Oh and finding the powder wasn't easy. It is not an option on their home/default web page. I had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder."
Very delicious,"I was really surprise about the taste. It was very delicious. You can really taste the pomegranate, blueberry and pistachio. No kidding. I love each one of those and to be combined in one great snack, that's so KIND :) Oh! The antioxidants is a plus. The reason I only give it four star is because it is high in calories and sugar. Other than that, I definitely would buy this again and recommend it. I just ordered another flavor too."
Not a good olive,I had Blue Cheese olives at a party and thought to buy these...these are not good olives let alone blue cheese...do not buy these they are horrible!
Great Flour with Wonderful Flavor,"I use this wheat bread flour when I make the basic recipe from the book ""Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day"". Because of the higher protein content of this flour, I have had to increase the amount of water from 3 cups to 3 1/2 cups (more if necessary). In the Artisan recipe you are looking for a very wet dough.  For a really great crust and crumb, bake the bread in a covered enameled cast iron skillet or dutch oven on heat tolerant parchment paper at 450 F for 30 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered. This flour has a sweet, nutlike flavor that I really enjoy."
Love pink salt!!!,"I started using Himalayan salt a little over a year ago. Pink in the shaker is a little strange, but I think it has been a good change. I only use pink salt now and this company has a great product!"
Awesome!,All of Ferdies products are delicious and well worth the price. We order them all at Christmas time and are never disappointed.
Nostagia Delivered to Your Doorstep,"I went through a spree of buying some pantry items off Amazon, and out of all of them, these boxes of quaker oatmeal were the best. Open two packs, put a little milk in to taste, and microwave for two minutes; you now go yourself a hot breakfast that tastes great. My Dad and I used to eat this camping all the time, and it really brings me back to those days. I highly recommend you buy this for not only the convenience of online shopping, but for the great flavor of rolled oats, raisins, and dates!"
Golightly Cough Drops,"I find these drops very soothing.  However, case price no longer available, being sold by each."
3 for chicken& brown rice- 0 for beef flavor,"Both of my cats like the chicken & brown rice and Newman's dry food flavors which I buy when they are heavily discounted. Neither of them would touch the beef flavor I bought on a gold box special. It has a faded milky slightly greenish pale brown hue, not medium brown as one would expect and oddly not much of an odor (I know why complain about that, but my point is is should have some type of aroma or odor to it.) Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice. I like Organix and By Nature ingredients and my cats do too. Sometimes I'll buy Natural Value or Natural Balance canned foods since they offer more variety of flavors."
astragalus seeds,I scratched one package of these seeds with sandpaper. I immediately planted them in potting soil.<br />Within three days nearly all had sprouted. I let half grow in a very warm garage. The rest were in a cooler area. The cool ones grew faster.  Very satisfied.
Gus Says: Two Paws Down,"Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like ""Tussy"" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just ""lick"" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange ""treat"". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus."
Favorite Kettle flavor and a great value!,"After reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!"
Food Made a Difference,"Our Chihuahua was raised on Royal Canin Medi Cal as a puppy but after switching to the adolescent, her coat started drying out and she was scratching a lot more.  I thought it might be the food so switched over to the breed specific Royal Canin Chihuahua and it made a huge difference!  She would barely touch the adolescent food but she loves the RCC28.  After only going through one 2lb bag, her coat is already back and the itching has stopped.  Well worth it.  The other option to try was the Hills Science Diet for small dogs (a lot cheaper) but I know RCC28 works so will stick with it.  The only annoying thing is that it's made in Canada, I'm Canadian but buying it is cheaper in the USA.  Go figure."
Too expensive & made my dog puke!,"My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.<br /><br />I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.<br /><br />I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.<br /><br />I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product."
Great taste,I really enjoyed this product.  It's very easy to mix and bake.  The taste and texture are very close to that of a wheat flour based bread.
Really enjoyed these!,These tortilla chips are delicious!  And they don't contain any bad oils or artificial ingredients.  I am following the Perfect 10 diet (with good success) and these fit on the diet nicely (in moderation of course... it is a starch).  Only way this could be better would be if ingredients were all organic.
OMG!  Love these chips!,"Crunchy, not greasy, no saturated fat, and YUMMY!  Oh, and VEGANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!  I'm completed addicted and have nearly gone through 2 cases."
Our Mastiffs Approve,"These wafers are great.<br /><br />Sensitive stomach's of our mastiffs approve.  I love the large wafers as if the dog has done something really good, they get a full wafer.  Otherwise, they get just a broken off part, I like controlling their rewards to how important the rewards are.<br /><br />Appears they are great tasting, the dogs go nuts.  I ran out of these and am using some others now, but still using the bag for the new treats!  It is a great durable, air-tight, ziplock bag.<br /><br />GREAT Product!"
Torani Raspberry Syrup,I love this stuff. I mix it with diet cola and think it tastes great. My wife mixes it with de-caf clear soda (like Sierra Mist) and shares it with our boys. A lot better price on-line through Amazon than buying it at the store one bottle at a time.
Great food toy!,"My terrier chases it all around the house. He finally gets tired - a good thing! The cap can be adjusted for the size of the treats, and how fast you want your dog to get the treats. If at the ""easiest"" setting, my terrier finds a way to remove the cap. For aggressive hunters I suggest keeping the cap at the tightest setting."
Delicious!,This is a great meal choice when you simply do not have the time to cook. Microwaveable bowls saves time on having to do the dirty dishes. The only drawback I see are the bowls are a bit too small. Would like to see Chef Boyardee make bigger bowls.
GREAT VALUE!!!!,"Not much to add to the other 5 star reviews, had to provide my 5 star rating, this product deserves the highest rating possible.  I only buy Ceylon Cinnamon, it is  healthier than Cassia, and it actually tastes better.  Mine arrived in the two 8 oz.  containers as pictured with a quantity of about 40 sticks per container, each 4"" long and approximately a half inch diameter width.  So you get about 80 sticks all together, not 85-90 as the description states....still a great value for what you get.  I also appreciate the fact that it is organic and is free of pesticides."
Good snack,"In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Sesame. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, ""No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors"". 11% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost."
Heart-healthy food!  I like it!,"My doctor ordered me to eat heart-healthy food, saying that raisin bran is one of the best for bulk count.  He said it's a good idea to not only eat it for breakfast, but to also eat a small bowl before dinner, especially for those over the age of fifty who might tend towards constipation.  It sure beats the ""prunes"" of my mother's day!<br /><br />I have always liked raisin bran, and this packet of 70 individual boxes will last me a little over a month ... if I follow my doctor's advice.<br /><br />I also enjoy the convenience of Amazon's new store for staple groceries.  The only drawback I see is finding the extra storage space if I order everything to last a month."
Love the coffee and the packaging.,"Great coffee - rich, full bodied but not bitter. I especially appreciate the minimal plastic used in the cup. Cups don't fit 100% in my Keurig storage turntable but they do fit. They just fall out a bit more easily."
Best Gluten Free Noodles. Period.,"We have spent 9 years cooking gluten free. We have tried every kind of noodle out there. Bionaturae are the best by far. You won't regret it. Now, when will these work with Subscribe and Save? I want a case a month!"
yum yum,"Not only is this coffee a real eye opener, it tastes pretty damn good too! Simply put, you can't beat these beans for the money, full stop."
Search Ended,It's hard to find this peach flavored black tea in the market. I was glad to find it online and at a good price.
the best crackers ever!,"These crackers are a wonderful compliment to wine and cheese.  Subtle flavor enhances, doesn't overpower, the main course.  I also love them if I'm not feeling well and need something subtle but filling to soothe my stomach.  Unbeatable price here."
My kids love them!,"Kids love them, we parents love that they are good for the kids, and an easy snack they can grab themselves.  Perfect to pack in lunches as well."
lasagna,"Great taste!  My family won't eat some brands of wheat products & prefer the regular white noodles usually, but this one passed the muster with them."
Love It!!,"This stuff is perfect for low carb/high protien chocolate power shakes... I mix it with banana whey powder and egg whites for a super thick low cal, low carb, chocolate-banana-sticky-paste-thingy. It's almost like a chocolate banana moose desert.... great for weight watching chocolate freaks!"
Awesome treat!,"What I really like about this treat is that it is something you hold while your dog licks it--rather than him taking his chewy someplace and getting busy with it, he ends up looking at me, holding my gaze for as long as I'll let him keep lickin' that rollerball. Awesome for my friend's dog who's old and can't chew. (This is the liver flavor--which smells awesome. The bacon did not ship, but my pup doesn't mind.)"
WARNING WARNING : Check the Shipping & Handling,I ordered this because I used it in England.  Being a Prime I assumed it was covered .. Yes I know .. I should have checked the somewhat finer print .<br />So it's all my fault and I haven't cancelled the order but be warned and watch the shipping cost.. I orderd 4 bottles.. here is my cost plus Shipping<br />Subtotal of Items:  $18.40<br />Shipping & Handling:  $42.26<br />  ------<br />Total for this Order:  $60.66<br /><br />Any questions as to why I feel like a fool ?<br /><br />Good stuff by hardly work 15 bucks a bottle.  I could have just gone to a local store and paid less than half this amount.
Dark Magic Coffee,"I am an avid coffee drinker and like my coffee strong and black. When I order coffee, I all ways  order the darkest and richest roasts. I change the roasts up a bit during the week so I do not get tired of one or another."
Yum YUM Healthy Coconut Oil!,"Not only is Coconut Oil really healthy, it tastes great. Awesome for cooking, baking, and just plain spreading on bread! Make sure to get the unrefined for that coconut taste.(extra virgin)<br />I am sure there are a million other uses too.."
Very Good Coffee,"My wife just gave me a Cuisinart K-cup coffee maker for Christmas, and I was very happy until I tried the so called ""extra bold"" k-cups that came with the machine.  It tasted much too weak.  We bought some decaf for her at the store, and it was worse.  As much as I liked the concept of the machine and the ease of brewing coffee, I was prepared to return it.  We went to the store today and I saw Emril's Big Easy Dark Roast K-Cup and decided to give it a try.  To give it a fair shot, I was going to set it on 8 ounces as I had the other coffees, but I forgot to put the maker on that setting, and it was at 10 ounces.  What resulted was a great cup of nice and strong coffee.  If this is not strong enough for you, you must be drinking ""battery acid"" coffee like some people I know do."
Chocolate Flavored with Coffee,Milk chocolate is usually too sweet but when you add coffee flavor suddenly it becomes just right. If you love hot chocolate mix in your coffee you will love this mocha inspired chocolate. Also when you buy a Newman's Own chocolate bar you know good things are going to happen. The Newman's Own Foundation has given over 250 million dollars to charities all over the world. I also like that this is 100% organic!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
Big Bad Baby Twinkle LOVES this,"This cat food has a great list of ingredients, including (I can see em too, when I dish it out) soft little chunks of carrots as well as other supplemental ingredients -- BBBT has a delicate stomach and Lick Your Chops Lamb and Rice canned has been her mainstay for years. My ONLY suggestion -- make it a little moister, because she poops bricks unless I add water to this. Once I add water to this food, she is fine."
Timothy's Chamomile Tea for Keurig is Awful,"Absolutely terrible. I like chamomile, this is disgusting. Terribly bitter, and just not right. Actually, I have tried a number of Keurig teas and many of them are way bitter, or otherwise just not good. Guess tea needs to be brewed like it's supposed to be.<br /><br />Also, why are some of these reviews about Chai? Guess the seller uses the same item number when they run out so they don't have to create a new listing from scratch?"
Wonderful taste,I was a little nervous about trying the taste of this tea but it taste smooth.  Everyday it does taste a little different but not bad. This is a great tea to try.
Great Tasting Product,Great Tasting and great deal with Subscribe and Save.  I like as an alternative to potato chips.  Not fried.  Baked.
Big size peanuts.,The peanuts are big in size and arrived on time . We like it since it comes with the skin on.<br />We make it salted at home. Enjoy it very much.
Good oolong for the price,"This review is for PoP Oolong tea bags. My tea background was first drinking Indian milk tea using black loose tea, milk, spices, and sugar. I added far-Eastern teas (non-milk varieties) in my search for a quicker tea to brew (milk tea needs more time to prepare). I am on my 3rd box of PoP Oolong tea. The tea is not like black or green teas. Be prepared for a bitter taste but with a sweeter aftertaste. Like black teas, this produces some kind of coating feeling on the tongue, almost similar to eating an unripened banana. It is somewhat woody in taste and smell (maybe a bit flowery. It may also be slightly sour, but less than some green teas. I have tried whole leaf oolong from a Chinese shop and that was more like green tea. If you can afford more expensive oolong teas, then you might get better quality. For the price, you're getting a good deal. I also think that the batches vary so sometimes you might get a stronger, bitter flavor but if you experiment with the brewing, you might get your desired flavor.<br /><br />To brew this PoP Oolong tea, realize that ground tea in bags will release their flavors much faster. My solution is to boil some filtered water. After bringing to a boil, I turn off the stove and add 1 cup (237 mL) hot water to the tea bag. Then wait ~30 seconds (or golden brown color appears)and remove the bag. The first cup usually extracts most of the caffeine and is the most bitter and strong taste. Now I can brew with another cup of the hot water. I can brew around 4 cups with the colors being golden brown, golden, light green, and very light green. It is best to brew by the color and not the time. If you leave the bag in too long, it will be terribly bitter.<br /><br />Tea brewing is an art and science, as many other things in life are. Please refer to the science of solvent extraction for a better idea. Basically, you are extracting the tea's aromatic compounds into the water. The flavor of the brew are mainly affected by water quality, extraction time (the time in water), and water temperature. You have to experiment with this for your preferred flavor. Sugar is absolutely not necessary, if prepared correctly."
the best i found,"this is the best cocoa i've had. way better than anything you can find at the supermarket, and even better than the other highly rated cocoas i tried from amazon.. also dissolves in water really easily and makes amazing hot chocolate (you can find recipes online - once you start making it from scratch you'll never buy the pre-mixed stuff again)."
Very handy,"Great design to hold the cups. Simple, effective, fits right under your Keurig machine so you do not lose any counter space."
Yuck,"Like other reviewers have stated, the quality varies.  The first three boxes I received were great: smooth, creamy, delicious coconut milk.  The one I received most recently is thin, watery, tastes horrible, and has a layer of coconut oil on top.  If this company does not care about quality control, I will not be ordering anymore.  I'm going to start making my own coconut milk."
Healthful alternative,"This is a great product if you re trying to avoid gluten. I like brown rice and that's probably why I like the taste of this vermicelli. The prep instruction could have been better, but otherwise the packaging was good. I found that soaking the noodles for about 15 minutes in warm water was best--giving them a softer texture. I may try parboiling them. These noodles work best with oriental seasonings and sauces. Obviously too delicate to stand up to heavy Italian sauces. I used Franks Sweet Pepper sauce with shrimp and oriental veggies and it was delicious!"
foul moudames,"Typical egyptian breakfast, i was pleasantly surprised to find that this is available from amazon.<br />For the past five years, i used to drive down to pike street market , park for $20 and buy a case worth $12.<br />From now on it will be through amazon.<br /><br />don't forget that these have to be mashed, put on some olive oil, squeeze a lemon and serve with a fresh tomato.<br />The egyptian public usually eat it in a pita bread on the streets of any city in egypt.<br />Very hard to prepare at home, because cooking time can exceed 3-4 hours"
please with product,"not a bad price, about the same as petco but petco doesnt carry the whitefish/sweet potato in the can. Our puppy isnt a real fan of the whitefish and it does smell bad but this is what her vet suggested to give her for her tummy problems.  I would probably stick with petco since it is about the same price minus the shipping fee.  this products was delivered in a good timely manner."
A Little Bitter,"I love Coffee People. My son and I love strong coffee. This one is good, but I think they went over the top just a bit and it makes for a slightly bitter taste. I am switching back to Wake Up call. If you like Jet Fuel, also try Wake up call, you may prefer it. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZFS"">Coffee People Wake Up Call K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"
Split Pea Soup with a nice bit of peppery heat,We had this for lunch for two days and both of us loved it.  After living in New Orleans for years we appreciated the peppery flavor.  Tasted like it had been cooked with a real smoked ham hock.  A lot better than the one my wonderful Mother used to make.  Will buy it again for sure.
Healthy Nutiva X Virgin Coconut Oil,"I love cooking with this brands high quality coconut oil. It is more stable at higher temperatures than EVOO. And it has been studied when add to foods 3x per day to Alheimers patients, that there was a measurable improvement in cognative functions. Who could ask for more."
could be better,"these are thin breadsticks, about 1/2 inch in total diameter, they arrived to me mostly broken up. i like to eat them alone but these may be better with hummus or something... maybe i should have gotten the one with sesame seeds at least. wouldn't purchase again"
Good enough,"Not my first choice, as the cherry flavor could be stronger, but it seems to be good quality, and the price is decent.  This pouch goes a long way."
Excellent snacks,"Not boring, interesting taste and combination of healthful food items.  I take one to gym for after I work out.  They are definitly not bland which is why I like them, some have a bit of kick, love the lemongrass in them."
This it like dog heroin.  There's nothing my dog won't do for liver treats.,"I've been using Freeze Dried Liver treats to train and reward my dogs for about 20 years.  It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.  You can't go wrong with these treats."
Handy dandy soup,"Ready in minutes. No dirty pot to wash. Just boil the water, pour in the cup, stir and enjoy. One cup to wash, but lots of spoonfulls of goodness."
"Healthy, tasty, and multi-functional","This stuff makes an excellent, relaxing evening drink - a great alternative to alcohol after the kids go down. The dose can be ramped up if a laxative response in the morning is desired.  It helps my wife become drowsy as bedtime approaches, but I only get the same reaction if I hold some in my mouth for sub-lingual delivery (which I recommend)."
Seller is a thief,I am using the salt and it is just fine but the seller was less than truthful. I bought a 2 pound bag and received a 4 ounce jar. Stay away from this thief of a seller. It would cost more to send it back than it cost in savings.
LOVE IT!,Tully's French roast coffee (caf & de-caf) are my favorite! Buying the K-cups through Amazon is cheaper since you can get the free shipping...and I'm happy.
Delicious,This coffee is amazing it tastes like blueberries and it has just the right amount of flavor. I think it goes best with vanilla cream  or regular. I will definately order more.
Wife Love's it,Big improvement over old product.  Great flavor and lasts a while.  My wife goes through a pack every couple of days.
Great quality. Heathful product.,"A refreshing cold beverage and a soothing, perfect, hot cup of tea. Offers healthful benefits."
Hazer Baba - You have to have a sweet tooth,"This is a Turkish treat very popular in Europe.  Unless you have an extreme sweet tooth this might be too rich for you.  Even with a sweet tooth, you can not eat too many of these at one time."
Tea,This tea has a very minty flavor. Too much for me even though I blend with regular tea.
Wasa and I,"I was thrilled to find this crispbread on Amazon.  It is a big part of my dietary needs.  If I get hungry, but don't want much but would like a little sweet, I just have Wasa crispbread (any variety)and peanut butter.  It is filling and tasty."
Excellent Product,"We ordered these recently because we used to get them at Whole Foods in Louisville or at Krogers.  But there is no Whole Foods where we live now and Krogers runs out for long periods.  Our cats love them.  One of the cats eats these treats about 90% of the time.  They're expensive but he's just so healthy and playful. (We break them up a little smaller)<br /><br />They came in just a couple of days, too.  Great service and packaged up nicely.<br /><br />Update--The first few times the product came in 2-3 days.  This time I ordered it June 26th thinking it would come by the following Tuesday but it's now July 6th and they are giving me a goal date of July 8th. To me, this is just too long. I've ordered things from East Coast before with standard shipping and gotten them in 3 days, so I don't know why it has to be 11-12 days for this.<br /><br />Barbara, Larry, and Cats"
Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound,"I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only ""dog foods"" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend."
"If you like sticky, you'll LOVE this product","I've ordered a number of different kinds of ""Kind"" bars and ""Kind Plus"" bars before.<br /><br />These Cranberry Almond + Antioxidents Kind Plus bars are, by far, the most sticky I have ever had!  The wrapping sticks to the product, the product sticks to your fingers, and pretty soon, you're a bit messy.  You really need a wet-wipe for this product.<br /><br />The product itself is quite delicious, however, so just know that while it's yummy and crunchy and chewy, you'd do yourself a favor by knowing about the stickiness ahead of time.  Oh, and don't get it in your hair or in your child's hair by accident!"
Delicious Stove-top Popcorn!,This popcorn is delicious! I love how it tastes and that I don't have to worry about the hulls being stuck in my teeth when I eat it! It really is virtually hulless! It pops quickly and easily on the stove-top by following the directions on the back of the bag! Perfect for those who prefer an alternative to microwave popcorn or popcorn without the hull! It's snack-tastic!
Amazing Grass,This amazing grass is very difficult to drink because the taste and texture of the powder. But the price is very good.
Stash is best,"Stash is just the best tea.  Not too strong or bitter, just right.  My favorite tea."
Eat well for less.,"It is impossible to find this product in my area.  I was pleased to find it, and for such a reasonable price.  I will order it again."
Best Jerky I've Had,"This is my favorite. I wish I could get it more often. Being away from home, deployed, the only way to get it is Amazon. I will even pay the higher price."
Makes Great Sourdough,"Bought this about 3 mos ago and have made probably 2 dozen loaves since. Makes really good sourdough, particularly if you take your time, make a biga from fed starter, age it overnight, make the dough and age that in the fridge overnight as well. But even if you shorten the time you can still get a good, slightly tart loaf.<br />This arrives in a small zip lock bag and has to be developed/nutured but its pretty simple. Key thing is the right ingredients; good unbleached flour and spring or distilled h2o (no chlorine).<br />This comes in a small ziploc bag. Instructions are to spoon it out of the bag into a container and add the flour and h2o. But the starter is very sticky so I found it easier and less wasteful to add some of the h2o to the bag, reseal it and massage a while to thin the starter. Then snip a corner like a homemade pastry bag and squeeze it out. Worked great."
excellent,The flavor is excellent.  My partner who does not have food allergies loves the pancakes that you can make with this mix. He prefers them to the wheat counter part. I do too. This product is a must have for anyone who is gluten intolerent. This mix is versitle. I have tried many of Pamela's recipes and they all come out.
Bitter,We love Newman's Own Nell's Breakfast Blend.  Gave this one a try and did not care for the bitterness.  Product was delivered promptly and packaged well.  This one is not for me.
Natural Temptations,"I bought this All Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor Treats for Cats by accident thinking they were treats for dogs  But, my MinPin, Bandit, thinks their the greatest treat in the world.  I can get him to do anything for a few of these!! He would probably even stand up and dance. He's crazy about them!!! It's not just a one time thing either, as I had to go back and buy a few more packages of them. He is so picky about everything else. They should advertise for Cats and Dogs also."
great organic boulion!,This is a great substitute for the store chicken and veggie bullion. The advantage is this product has no MSG or nitrates and less salt. It is on the softer side so it dissolves much quicker than the rock hard bouillons you get in the supermarket.
I love it,I bought the soda maker and the energy mix it's just like red bull but a little sweeter it saved me Money instead of buying red bull every day I just made it. it was great.
Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix,The sugarless mix is very satisfactory and it's fewer calories. Go for it.
"Chocolate a 5, but customer service a 0","When I lived in Wisconsin, I was a big fan of this choc.  After moving overseas, I sent emails to the company asking about how to get it, or even act as exporter for it!  But answer came there none (to borrow a Lewis Carroll phrase.)  Such a pity."
Tasty Treat Should Be Enjoyed Carefully,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 5:41 Mins<br /><br /></span>Live taste-test featuring two fans who eat gluten free."
Really good nector drink......,"I read the one review that was available and was surprised. One star, awful taste, what? I really liked it, it was not quite as good as Kerns Peach which is the BEST I've found, but its right up there. I remember drinking this product as a kid and it still hits the spot."
Great Snack!,I bought this for the first time last week and love it! It's a great grab-and-go snack that's pretty healthy but tastes like a treat. Highly recommend.
agave is good for you,"great product, and shipping... agave is tasty and healthy and does not add an aftertaste<br />if you are looking out for your sugar intake, try agave!"
"OMG--tastes like ""real"" bread","New to the gf diet.  After trying the dry packaged stuff at the store, using a recipe from the internet and Bob's Red Mill--this stuff is unbelievable.  We are a bread lover family and this bread passed the test with flying colors.<br /><br />My husband's mom is always baking goodies and this tasted just like her homemade bread.  Perfect to take to Holiday meals and the gluten crowd wouldn't even know--it's that good.<br /><br />Even if a miracle occurred and we could buy white bread, I'm not sure we would want to--it's that good.:)"
Deliciously smooth,I love this coffee.  It is very smooth.  It reminds me of coffee that I had at a 4 star hotel that was $3 for an 8 oz cup.  It is delicious!
Fancy Feast from Amazon is best,"My little kitty cats, well maybe I shouldn't say little as my Maine Koon weighs 25 pounds, but my sweet little spoiled darlings will only eat Fancy Feast and in particular, salmon and shrimp grilled.  Sometimes they will eat other Fancy Feast but this one is their all time favorite.  And believe me, they know how to get what they want.  The auto delivery is wonderful from Amazon because I don't have to go shopping and lug cat food home.  Great.  Sharon Dalrymple"
Oat Bran Extravaganza,"This is a delicious, and wonderfully affordable oat bran. I make large batches of oat bran muffins as heart-healthy snacks for my family, and would go broke buying the same quantity of bran in small boxes at the supermarket or in the bulk food section of high-priced health food stores. Bergin's oat bran is a find--delivered right to my door!"
**********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"
Thought I'd be eaten along with the product.,"You know how it is when your kitty literally gets ""frantic"" when they find just the right eats?  This is one of those times.  I'm swamped with cats. You'd think they'd not eaten for a month. >^.^&lt;>^.^&lt;>^.^&lt;"
"Ok, but VERY hard.","I'm used to croutons being light and crunchy.  These seem overly hard.  The taste is ok, but a little bland when I compare it to other brands.  But then again the other brands aren't organic made.  I do find I like them on soup, cause they soften up a bit.  On salad though, it was just too hard."
Excellent Chips !!!,The 'Malt' Vinegar is what sets these chips apart from other Salt & Vinegar chips........ These are the best...... Will Buy Again!!!
"User error, or chewy popcorn?","The movie style flavor is there, but the popped kernels are a bit chewy. It could be that I made it wrong by using a machine instead of the ""Whirely Pop"" thingy."
perfect for everything,"These tomatoes are perfect for everything. I use them for pasta salads, soup base, pasta sauces, and the list goes on and on. You can put them on top of toasted bread for a unique bruschetta if you want. I have tossed them in scrambled eggs and thrown cheese on top for a quick and yummy omelet. Highly recommend these tomatoes. They are fire roasted and seasoned perfectly. Use subscribe and save for the best deal."
Tastes almost like home baked,"At first bite, Pamela's Oat Raisin bars taste a little bland. But that is only because they aren't made with large amounts of sugar (compared to your standard oat-raisin bar). The taste is, in fact, very natural -almost, if not exactly like, home made. The are very moist,and chewy, too. On the downside, there are not many in the box and the bars themselves are rather small. I found myself liking these bars the more I ate and will definitely buy them at the store as long as they are not too expensive."
Gluten free product review,This product is a really good sub for real spagetti when you have someone in the house that can't eat gluten or spaghetti made with traditional flour. My husband can eat gluten but pronounced this spaghetti every bit as good as the regular kind. I am happy to find these products online and ordered the package of 6 12 ounce bags. It needs the salt they say to add though so don't leave that out or it is terribly bland.
My dogs love these!,"I've tried so many different rawhides and chewies, and my dogs love Dingo products the best. If your dogs are picky like mine, give these a try."
great product,"this was a great product at a great price, i would recommend it to everyone that uses the kcups. its a great product"
Dec 2010 gift / exp date October 2011,Via is an amazing creation by Starbucks.<br /><br />Just to follow up on anyones expiration date worries....<br /><br />Received as a 2010 Christmas gift.  It expires October of 2011.<br />Maybe the other reviews brought this concern to the companies attention & they have corrected the issue.
Very pleased with my order!,"The selection I received was perfect, and I my husband was thrilled with his gift! I would definitely do business with this vendor again!"
Best healthy snack out there!!!,"when you think of fries you think of fried food and oil but now when you order smart fries!!! i ordered these and there amazing best heathy snack on the market with a great variet of flavors. i recommend ""Smart Fries"" to those healthy snack people out there!"
LOVE THIS VANILLA,"This vanilla tastes really good.  Wasn't sure I'd taste a difference, but I have to say that I DO taste a difference in the flavoring."
Delicious treat!,"I LOVE this tea. It is only ever-so-slightly sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy my nightly dessert cravings. Because it is caffeine free, I can drink it before bed. Wonderful product at a great price."
"Not quite ""dried"" peppers...","I dehydrate many types of peppers and then use a coffee grinder to make a powder out of them.  I was expecting to be able to do that with these peppers, but they are not dry enough for that.  They are closer in texture to the dried apricots you buy to eat out of hand.  Sort of leathery and pliant.<br /><br />Not a big problem, as I just plopped them on the dehydrator for a day until they were brittle/rock hard, and then ground them up.  As a precaution, I set the dehydrator outside on the deck to avoid the fumes.  They smell incredible -- a lot like chipotle peppers, actually.  I tasted just a tiny bit of some of the outer skin, and it was quite hot.  I'm sure with the seeds and veins included when ground, it's going to be flaming.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of rope fibers mixed in with the peppers, but I didn't mind this, as it reminded me that these were dried the old fashioned way - by tying and hanging them up.  It just took a little time to pull these threads off as I was placing them on the dehydrator trays.  I probably could have not bothered with that and just ground up the fibers with the peppers.<br /><br />I'll add to this review when I find out exactly how much ""one pound"" of these peppers actually weighs when properly dried."
gluten free gets better,This is the best bread I haved tried.I make it in my food processor and it is great<br /><br />Betsy
good but,"Olio Santo comes highly recommended-so ordering 3 bottles seemed a good idea-NOT!! When one receives 3 in March, and the expiration date on the bottles is only a few months hence, one has thrown money away. Shame on the company for sending out this as such. I had to give away so that I knew it would not go bad."
fancy coffee shop taste and smell,"one day recently, i purchased this crema e gusto lavazza when it was on sale, because i know my friend uses lavazza in his espresso-maker, and i thought i'd break out the moka maker again.  well.  holy cow.  i had forgotten what good coffee tasted like, based on my steady kcup habit.  i can barely taste my keurig kcups now, which seem fairly bland, or too sharp, or too...something else wrong in comparison. i'll still use my keurig due to the convenience, and perhaps i'll try using lavazza in my keurig as another review mentioned.  But, i think you cannot go wrong with a stove top moka of this stuff.  it is not bitter, it is not sour, it has no off notes-- just extremely rich and heady, a good hefty body and smoothness that can't be beat.  the outrageously excellent aroma permeates the house like a great coffee shop you might step into.<br /><br />i read some of the bad reviews, and i can't understand the negative comments, just as they can't understand the good reviews--taste is individual i guess!  But, i LOVE this coffee!  it's extremely good, and i will even drink it late in the evening despite the caffeine, due to the wonderful flavor. crazily, i find myself looking forward to a quiet weekend morning to indulge, just like you might see on some goofy ad where a woman with closed eyes is smiling in dreamy wonder while sniffing a cup. try this coffee- maybe you'll be lucky to be in the majority for whom this rings all the bells.<br /><br />update: i tried the Lavazza in the Keurig, and it just does not do it justice in comparison to the stove-top moka method. but, it still tastes better than regular k-cups.<br /><br />update 2: i tried this in the Aeropress (french drip type) machine that had over 1000 great reviews here on Amazon, and i have to say, this combo will be my only go-to coffee from now on.  the Aeropress, in addition to being easier to use than stove top, seems to make a less burnt flavored and more creamy brew.  this, combined with condensed sweetened milk (like the Vietnam-french drip type)is heavenly. i'm buying a second Aeropress to have this combo at home in addition to the office."
Not a EVERLASTING treat,"Does not last more than 15 min, I have a Terrier mix dog about 55 Ib It took him 5 min to eat one half of the everlasting treat. It is good treat but has nothing to do with it's name."
good quality - but too much salt,"The quality of this chicken is good, but I think it should have half as much salt or none at all."
Good coffee,"We had this brand over in Italy. When we got back, we ordered this coffee from Amazon. We got hooked on the Oro espresso ground, but this kind makes a great cup of coffee and is less expensive."
Natural Ingredients,"Some time ago I overhauled my dogs' diet after learning that the so-called ""premium"" brand I had been feeding them had by-products and other undesirable ingredients. One of my dogs is a little fussy and it was hard to find something else he liked. We finally settled on this brand. I like that you can actually see some of the vegetables and fruits that are mixed in, there are no by-products and it's less expensive than some of the other natural and organic brands."
The best noodle,This is my favorite noodle and I was so happy that I could find this in Amazon !<br />This noodle is just amazing ! you should try this.
I love this stuff!,"I absolutely love this stuff!  It has the right amount of flavor and kick! I put it on just about everything! (i.e pizza, salads, sandwiches, poultry, soups) Can't get enough of it!"
Not the same,"I was disappointed when I tried these. I was expecting a wintergreen flavor with a texture similar to the dipping sticks included in Fun-Dip, at least that's how I remember them tasting fifteen years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if the company that originally manufactured the original either went out of business or discontinued them as these were probably very controversial.<br /><br />This item tastes more chewy and chaulky and there's not much flavor other than sugar with a waxy coating. I can't help but compare these to antacids. They are also thinner and bent and look more like a hand-rolled cigarette than one that is mass-produced.<br /><br />I would like to add that even though I consumed candy cigarettes as a kid, I do not smoke as an adult. My parents and school always reminded me of the negative effects of smoking so I honestly never had an interest, but I do ironically enjoy candy cigarettes, but sadly these aren't what I remember."
Best ever waffle mix!,Krusteaz is one of my favorite brands--I love all the baking products.  This produce is very tasty and easy to mix--I have even added dried blueberries (which puff up like fresh fruit when the waffle is baked).
Mix 'em up - spit 'em out,"My friend has twice bought these kits for her sons--mainly because she wanted the cute box they come in to use as lunchboxes, but they've also made the cookie mix.  It seems to have been a fun activity and the boys were proud of having ""made cookies.""  But having tried them twice, I have to say, these are some of the yuckiest cookies I've ever eaten. The soft texture is nice, but they taste like some off-brand cookie you'd get at the dollar store."
Favorite Kitty Treat,"My cats are picky about treats. They seem to prefer only catnip flavored treats and Pounce Crunchy is their favorite of those. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find it in the store (grocery, Petco or Walmart)lately. We were running low and no one wants to be around kitties when they are out of treats! Thankfully, Amazon came to the rescue at a great price. We are now set with snacks for a while and I know where to turn next time!"
UTI,"My husband is a paraplegic and was having UTIs constantly.  Since he started drinking a cup of this tea every morning, he hasn't had a UTI for a year."
Good way to wean yourself off sugar...,"I drink a lot of coffee and ergo use a lot of sugar, but am trying to cut sugar out of my diet.  Although I will use Splenda, I am not fond of the aftertaste.  I've tried Truvia too, which also has an aftertaste.  I guess since none of these sugar substitutes are really sugar, they're all going to have an aftertaste.  So while this product is no different, the slight vanilla flavor helps to either cut down on the aftertaste or distracts your tastebuds from it.  One downside is that the bottle goes quickly for hardcore coffee drinkers, which probably more expensive than just straight Splenda.  Overall, I think it's a good alternative to sugar and would recommend it to those who are trying to cut down on sugar consumption."
Great dog bones,My dog loves these.  The problem is my dog is a bull dog and can eat these in a short time.
Cute,My son was thrilled to add these to his Pez collection. They're cute.. standard Pez dispensers. They work very well.
flavor blends,"I have been using regular splenda for awhile now and I like flavored coffee, so I decided to try this product. It packs more of a ""flavor punch"" when I mixed it with another liquid flavored creamer. This product does not leave an after taste."
"Delicious, best ever","Orange Blossom is the best ever honey and this is one tastes better than any other I've tried.  The service was excellent, my order was processed and shipped immediately. Don't hesitate to order this product. Thank you."
Not bad for a Natural Soda,I am on the HCG diet and I am a soda lover. I just don't like coffee or tea and only getting to drink water was a drag and then I found this soda. Not bad for a natural soda. It is not like soda that most people are used to but after a day or two it can grow on you. It's OK and gets me by. I would recommend this product to anyone that has to has a soda and is looking for an alternative.
we will eat it however....,"Give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy.  Although this gives you less fat, there is a distinct taste difference.  We will eat what we purchased but I am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great PB turn into a yuckky PB..."
An Ode to Nostalgia,"Having consumed this brand as a child, i was compelled to give it a try as an adult.<br />Back when i was young, i could never get enough of it but I had a pretty hard time trying to<br />find this product in various retail outlets i visited.<br /><br />And of course amazon stepped in to alleviate that issue of availability.<br />The taste and texture seems to be a little bit different from what i remember growing up.<br />This one comes in the powdered form, the one i grew up on was a flaky version.<br />The taste is still the same, and good as ever.<br /><br />The only one turn off is price, Its unsustainable as a daily cereal at this price, and for that<br />reason it will be a novelty item"
you might prefer these to Trader Joe's...,"because the ones at TJ's don't have strings.  These are individually packaged with strings.  TJ's are not separately wrapped and don't have strings.  While that saves on packaging, I find that having a string saves me from having to use a plastic spoon to dip and retrieve the tea bag."
"old, stale, spoiled",I have been chewing clorets for years and there was something very wrong with the gum in this order. It tasted very funny.
Jasmine,"I love this tea. I used to buy loose jasmine green tea but this bagged variety is much more economical and tastes almost as good. It's great for people that are not big fans of traditional green tea, since it is much lighter and more flavorful. I don't even add any sweetener I like the plain taste just fine. The caffeine content is not as high as the one of coffee, or even regular green tea, which makes this a good beverage choice at all times of the day."
Better than in the shell,"One of our office workers went to Hawaii, so I broke these out to share while he was gone.  It was a hit, I was asked for more - so I pulled out the pistachio's that I also purchased."
Classic Cookies,"All of the flavors I've tried are great; but my favorite are the mint.<br /><br />I was concerned re the shipping issue based on other reviews.  When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.  Anyway - I actually preferred the thinner ones, as the overall flavor balances were better and the texture was more appealing.<br /><br />So while my shipping story was a success, I can't claim that the product was really properly packaged, and I wouldn't therefore want to leave a review claiming that."
"A sweet, healthy treat","Low sugar, low fat, a measured amount, and sweet and chocolatey enough to satisfy my evening sweet tooth cravings."
Great product!,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
"baby likes it, i am afraid mom and dad may like it more!","This is good stuff. baby loves it and asks more, more all the time, the problem is hard to limit it. I read reviews before and i wondered how tasty could it possibly be that everyone is raving..hell yea, how is a baby cracker so delicious?? isn't baby food supposed to be bland:p i always sneak in a few or more...ummm...good thing this the a 6 pack from amazon...."
"Like the ""real"" thing!","If you were to give me a taste test of these v. Oreos, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to tell the two apart. I originally bought these cookies in order to satisfy my periodic craving for ""Cookies & Cream"" ice cream. I crush them up and then stir them into a vat of vanilla frozen yogurt. They're perfect! My non-GF friends approve too!"
Purina is always the leader,"I will have to admit that I don't take a lot of heed to the food I give to my dogs.  Typically, they simply aren't show, work or hunting dogs, so I'm not typically concerned about it. I will have to say that since introducing my pet to Beneful, she's actually eating less and has more energy. Overall a good product for my ""pot licker."" ;)"
Yum,I love these beans. I eat em cold right out of the can frequently - but they are delicious heated also :)<br /><br />Glad I can get these - and glad I stumbled on them.
Delicious,"This is 100% juice, cherry and apple, that's it.<br />I love it- delicious cherry flavor, doesn't really get cut by the apple juice at all, it just sweetens it enough.<br />I wish it wasn't as expensive as it is... but I do get it now and again as a treat."
Influenster review,These are some good cookies. my daughter loved these... now i must go out and buy more because my husband wants them for work.
"Good - not very ""spicy"" ...","I liked this just fine.  The name is a little misleading:  It's really not very spicy at all.  It does have a lot of flavor, however.  I've tried it on sandwiches (very good), and on tacos of various types.  I liked it best on fish tacos, with shredded lettuce and chopped tomato.  It also works well on chicken tacos and burritos.  I also liked it as a salad dressing for a ""southwestern"" salad (romaine, corn/black bean salsa, chopped tomato, a few ounces of chopped cooked chicken, mixed colby/jack cheese (or pepper jack), a few sliced black olives, and a couple of tablespoons of this sauce.  Amazon's price is quite good compared to my local grocery stores."
Very peanut buttery! Love it,"If you can't get enough of the peanut butter taste, this product is for you! The taste is really strong and it is great! Perfect for shakes and just about anything that is blended."
Love them,Good texture.  Not too sweet.  But the walmartt version of these I believe is a lot cheaper and tastes about the same.
Office addiction,The whole department is addicted to these wonderful little treats.  The candy jar is empty by the end of the week so this is a much better option rather than the small bags I've been getting at the local pharmacy store.  The individually wrapped pieces make it a sanitary treat for everyone to grab.
Love the taste,"Someone introduced me to this tea and ever since then I am in love with the taste. It has a sweet taste and the hot spice cinnamon is such a treat. I have a new favorite tea, thats for sure. I highly recommend this tea."
Must Age to Gain Full Strength,"This tea is so mild that it has no real effect on me or my husband.  Tastes okay though.  I guess it may help you to relax a bit but as far as making you sleepy,  it just doesn't.<br />Edit(08/24/2012):  This tea needs to age before it gains full strength.  When we first got it, seems it had no effect on either of us.  Now, a few weeks later, it has gained potency and when I tried it again, it definitely does pack a punch...it puts me to sleep.  We must have gotten a freshly made batch.  I have never had a bad experience with the Yogi teas but this Bedtime tea is the first one that did not live up to its claims at first.  I would order this again. I put honey and hazelnut creamer in it and it tastes very exotic and good that way. I do the same for the Yogi Triple Ecinachea tea also but I also add lemon balm tincture (15 drops) which really boosts the healing power of the tea to new levels!!!  It even heals cold sores overnight prepared with the lemon balm tincture(homeade with fresh lemon balm leaves steeped in 100-proof vodka). At my age, you need all the help you can get lol."
Yummy,"I bought this at Costco.  Thought it was amazingly wonderful and went back to get more.  It was gone.  I had the manager look it up and discovered that Costco had discontinued it - but the manager found some at a store 15 miles away.  I drove there right away and bought them out.  160 packets.  That's how good I think it is.  We are half way through, and I was getting a little anxious tonight as I made dinner.  So, yeah, Amazon carries it.  My kids love this.  90 seconds and it's done!"
Perfect mix for me,This mix has everything that I want and none of what I don't want. Most mixes have too much salt in them for me. I like the unsalted ones so that I can add a little bit if I want.
Great variety at a good price!,"I just received my order today.  As noted in other reviews, the K cups came in a stapled brown bag.  However, unlike the previous review, all the K cups were clean and undamaged.  None of them were expired, and the earliest expiration was in mid-August .... plenty of time for my family.  I was so pleased with the selection in my bag!  Here are the details:<br /><br />12 regular coffees<br />10 flavored coffees (including several limited edition flavors)<br />3 hot teas<br />3 cappuccinos<br />2 iced coffees<br />2 decafs<br />1 iced tea<br />1 cider<br />and 1 hot cocoa<br /><br />I love that I have the opportunity to try so many different brands and flavors.  If I am looking for a variety pack in the future, I will definitely order again!"
"Balalnced, healthy dog food","Our dogs have been on Holistic Select for 3 years now, and we are very happy with it.  The ingredients are well balanced, natural and healthy.  Our dogs have shown a marked improvement in overall health, coat, energy and weight since switching to Holistic Select from a mainstream dog food three years ago.  Plus, they love it!"
Cytosport Gives me Greatness,I've been drinking this stuff everyday before i go to the gym and it gives me the boost i need to be awesome.
Stramondo Organic Marzipan,"I love marzipan, and this is the best I've ever had. I can't understand why the kind they make in California has to have corn syrup and artificial flavors in it??? I'll pay more for the best."
best tasting green tea,I usually drink tea-leaves tea and I think tea bags are just not as good. But yogi green tea is a big surprise! It tastes so good. I like that it has a subtle pleasant refreshness and sweetness. Love it.
MY NEW FAVORITE DRINK !!!,"I used to be a strictly ""morning coffee"" person. NOT ANYMORE. Coming from TN/AL, I only drank tea in good 'ole Southern style: ICED and SWEET. But I jumped off the java wagon to try this as I love mandarin oranges and thought it sounded good. Well it's not good...it's WONDERFUL! Some days, I find myself having 2 or 3 cups; a couple in the morning and one at bedtime. The taste is perfectly blended with all 3 flavors equally represented. A bit sweet so some folks might even be able to enjoy it straight up. All-in-all, this is the best K-cup of ANY kind I've had thus far."
"if you miss ginger snaps because of an allergy, these are great","My son has a gluten allergy and his favorite cookies before were ginger snaps, so we were wondering how we were going to find a substitute. These are perfect. Crispy, crunchy and great ginger snap flavor. He loves them. I even sneak one now and again to enjoy with my tea!"
Chips Rancid Despite December 2010 exp date,I opened a bag of these chips. I thought I detected a strange odor but put one into my mouth anyway.<br /><br />The chips were definitely rancid. I tried several other bags and discovered the same rancid taste.<br /><br />I threw them all away. Caveat emptor.
makes the best pfeuferrneuses!,The anise oil was nowhere to be found in Modesto.  I could not believe the inexpensive cost...even w/ s&h.  The cookies were the best!  They tasted better than the expensive ones we wait for and buy at Christmas...and I made them in April!  The product arrived in perfect condition and much sooner than I'd anticipated.
So good that I had to come review this 30 seconds after getting my coffee,"Ok, so it is a little strange that these literally come in a brown paper bag. But, I don't care. I got an awesome assortment of coffees to try. I'm excited to try each and everyone. No ""filler"" flavors like I expected. I will certainly be buying again. And if you are buying a Kurig for someone for Christmas, I Highly recommend you purchase this for them as well!! Where is the 6 stars button?"
Great kitty food,"My two kitties differ on many of their food preferences, and we are also mindful of their health and so we try to limit their fish intake.  So, we are grateful that we found the wellness turkey recipe.  It's something that they both absolutely love and something that we feel good about feeding them."
Betty Crocker frosting in a fancy package,"They charged me $10.00 for shipping and handling.  I figured, okay, it is in a temperature secure package and they rush it because it is perishable, but no, it came in a regular box, and it was sent out before a holiday weekend, so it spent extra time floating around.  Once it arrived it was not 'individualy wrapped', but two large bags in one box.  The main ingredient if vegetable shortening and the flavor and texture is about the same as frosting off the baking shelves at my grocery store.  Waste of time and money, but if you aren't picky the flavor is okay."
Great flavor!,"These are full of nuts.  Great flavor.  Sweet due to the fruit, but the nuts keep it under control."
Pleased,We've gone through 5 cans now and my daughter loves this stuff.  I still went ahead and purchased this and the happybellies rice cereal after reading some great and not so great reviews for the Happybellies products and unlike some of the reviewers I've had none of the funky smell/gray discoloring.  I'm assuming they fixed the problems. We mix it with fruit or feed it to our daughter just mixed with breastmilk.
Very Delicious,I really enjoy this Cinnamon roll coffee.  It's very good.  It's great first thing in the morning. It's a good light to medium blend without a strong taste of cinnamon roll.  Just enough without being to strong.  This is definately my favorite coffee.
Strange Aftertaste,"This is my second purchase from Pacific Natural Foods. While I loved the Poblano Corn soup, I didn't care for this one at all and neither did my husband. We both agreed there is a very strange aftertaste that lingers after each bite--not enjoyable for either one of us. In fact, I just refused to eat the rest of my portion. Neither one of us could identify exactly what that aftertaste was. I guessed perhaps the lemongrass was the culprit, completely overpowering the flavor of the soup, but my dh said it tasted like chemicals. Who knows? I suggest for those looking to buy in bulk and have never tried the Thai Sweet Potato soup, definitely go buy 1 box from your local store's natural food section so you're not wasting your hard earned money if you end up not liking it."
Overall overpriced.,Do a google search. You can find quality invertase for a dollar an ounce elsewhere. Rather than $5 (or more) an ounce on Amazon.
Best EVCO available!,"This stuff is pure coconut heaven in a jar. I put it on after the shower & before bed and it moisturizes excellently with the fragrance of coconuts. Its quite greasy at first as it melts with body heat but gets absorbed rather quickly. My cuticles, elbows, heels thank me. It really does have antifungal and antibacterial properties. I've had it for a couple of months and am not even half done with the jar. As a hair conditioner it didn't work for me because it was too hard to rinse out, my hair was weighed down for days. But, I put this on my now baby soft skin religiously. I will buy another tub to try cooking with."
Seriously...?,I can go into any store that sells candy and find everything that they have in the 90s crate and it would cost MAYBE $10 and get a nice REUSABLE basket to put it in from the thrift shop. They don't even have Crybabies or Warheads or Bubble Tape!!!!! RIP OFF!!!!!!!!
Tastes similar to chalk,"I have been drinking a Thai version of Nescafe instant coffee and loving it, so when I saw the Memento Mocha mix I was eager to try. With anticipation I opened the package, filled with hot water, stirred and took a sip and was immediately greeted with a flavor of chocolate syrup and chalk, if there is such a flavor. I tried adding additional half and half to save the cup of coffee and that did not mask the gritty chalky flavor. I will be giving the rest away of the box, they were that bad. I am disappointed and will not even finish the 1 cup I did make."
Very good for women,"I try to take this product on a regular basis, every day or every couple of days. It has helped me with an estrogen dominance problem (heavy bleeding) and other pms symptoms. I consider it to be a medicinal product. It is loaded with nutrients women need, like iron, potassium, etc... I love that it is organic.<br />The best way I have found to take it is like a tea. I started out putting about 1 tablespoon in a mug and filling it with hot water, then sipping it.<br />My favorite recipe now is to put 1 Tbsp in the mug and stir in about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Then I add the water, leaving some room at the top. Then I pour in about 2-3 Tbsp of coconut milk and stir. This ""tea"" is rich and creamy and tastes a lot like hot coco with a little zip from the cayenne."
Astoundingly good,"My husband and I just completed a hike of the West Highland Way in Scotland, where the prospect of a cozy pub at the end of a wet day's walking was really motiviting. Then I ordered my first gin & tonic in the UK and became obsessed with Indian water...it really transforms the drink into something amazing. Most pubs were using BritVic tonic water in the little single-serving bottles, but I discovered on our return to the States that BritVic is completely unavailable in the US or Canada. Fever Tree was recommended as a viable alternative and I've been very pleased with the results. Totally worth it."
Nantucket Coffee,"A wonderful blend, very tasty, absolutely no bitterness like some french roasts I've had. The product was shipped on time and in perfect condition. I fully reccommend this coffee."
No salt Ketchup at last!,"For someone who doesn't/can't have a lot of sodium, this was a great find. Now the whole house is using it. I even got my regular grocery store to carry it, for a bit cheaper also. Too bad Heinz doesn't put it in a bigger container. Hopefully it will catch on and make the larger size.<br />It tastes EXACTLY like regular Heinz, so why not get the sodium out of this food? We all eat too much salt. Just pay some attention to any packaged dinner or canned food (even vegetables).<br /><br />I'll never go back to 'regular' ketchup!"
More mints than I will ever need!,I wish these mints came in smaller packaging. These mints are a favorite of my boss--he will get a package every year until he retires.  I hope they keep! I am glad amazon carries them--else I would have to go to Europe to buy them.
Excellent!,"This is an excellent product.  I tried a handful that a friend had and I was hooked!  It has good flavor without being too salty.  You can also chop them and add to salads or in green beans.  My kids enjoy them also, good alternative to junk snacks!"
Love Wasa,"Wasa crackers pretty much rule, and in my opinion, this is the best of the lot. They are much better for you than traditional American style crackers. The sesame imparts an excellent flavor. Wasa crackers go especially well with hummus and peanut butter, so if you're a fan of either, you should give them a try."
do not even try the other brands,"The texture and taste of this product is better by far than the other brands, stay clear of the brand who's ""man wearing the red cap"" is on the lable"
My favorite coffee...,"I recently treated myself to a keurig single serve machine <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6"">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a> and was anxious to experiment with different coffees.  I am not a fan of strong coffee so I use the travel mug size to make this blueberry coffee.  This green mountain blueberry coffee is THE best coffee ever for someone who loves the treat of a light flavored coffee and the aroma is to die for.  I am not a coffee purist and do not claim to be an expert; however I do know the difference between a good and bad cup of Joe and this gets my vote for great flavored coffee.  Please try to buy fair trade coffee - take a few minutes to read up on the subject, it is worth it!"
Tazo love,"You may want to drink healthy and if you do, these green tea k-cups are just the right medicine.<br />They provide the perfect dosage of comfort, taste, and well-being. You may even be able to forego that afternoon cup of coffee and rejoice in the ease of this product."
THIS STUFF IS SAM-EZING,"This stuff works wonders!<br /><br />I went through a pretty rough patch in my life. I lost 2 dogs, 1 cat, and my best friend/roommate to cancer all within 2 years.<br /><br />My doctor placed me on Welbutrin but that stuff made me completely insane! 1 day I was angry, 1 day I was completely miserable, 1 day I was unbearably tired. I also had a horrible headache when I was taking it. I felt like was a mindless zombie on Welbutrin. I decided to stop taking the Welbutrin before it settled into my system.<br /><br />I figured I would try and go the more natural route after reading all the side effects of the other anti-depressant medications they have available. I first tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014DT1W"">Kira St Johns Wort Tablets - 45 Tablets</a>. These seemed to help, but it was very mild and not consistent in keeping my mood up.<br /><br />Then...there was Nature Made Sam-E. I tried some of the store brand Sam-E's to try and keep costs down, however, none of the other brands even came close to working as good as Nature's Made. And if you shop around you can usually find a buy one get one free at Walgreens, Giant, CVS, or even Amazon for a total of $45 bucks for 76 400mg tablets.<br /><br />This stuff helped me through the roughest time of my life. I've been using Sam-e well over 2 years now and if I even missed one dose I would immediately notice a huge change in my mood. I have been taking 1 400mg pill a day since I started. Once in a while I would take took 2 or 3 in a day.<br /><br />I just started taking 1 pill every other day to give my body a break because I do not like to be dependent on any type of medication. But for those super hard times, this stuff really helped to get me through.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying Sam-E. I prefer the 400mg. They are a better value and work much better. Especially before trying any prescription anti-depressants. It is a natural approach to overcoming depression, has low to no side effects at all (I never experienced any), and even if it does not help with improving your mental health, at least it is supporting your joints.  ;)<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
Finnska Licorice,"I am a black licorice fan, and this is the best I've ever eaten. It's delicious! I was able to buy a case at a very reasonable price and share it with my friends that like black licorice too."
Best Cereal BY FAR,"Without a doubt, I would recommend this wholesome and sweet cereal treat to anyone. The crunchy o-shaped pieces are filled with crispy rice, graham cracker bits, and infused with delicious honey flavor. ""Oh! What a great cereal!"""
"These are my all time favorite sugar free, gluten free, dairy free dessert","I LOVE these macaroons.  I was told today my supermarket has discontinued them.  I can't figure out why since I've been buying the market out of them regularly!  I have to check back with the natural foods department when the supervisor is in to explain that it has to be a mistake.  I'll be ordering them online until the market straightens it out.  But these are amazing macaroons, and my husband keeps eating them up too!  If you like coconut and prefer honey to sugar, you can't go wrong with these delightful treats!  And they have no gluten which many people (myself included) are trying to avoid."
"Amazing, mood-boosting chocolate!","A friend gave me a piece of this chocolate bar after a particularly difficult meeting. It is amazing! Every time I took a bite, I could feel my spirits lift. Yum!"
My Favorite Mass-Market Jerky,"Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say ""gentle kick"", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky."
"Bland, mostly flavorless white soup with potato","This soup has no discernible dairy or clam flavor at all.  There is a bland white base, chemically thickened, with no hint of milk, butter, or cream.  I found mostly chunks of white potato and a small quantity of tiny, hard, flavorless clam fragments. There is a faint chemical aftertaste and a little sand.  Doesn't taste remotely like any clam chowder I've ever eaten before."
The Best Cat Treats - Ever!,"My Bear (big Maine Coon kitty) will not eat any other treats!  These are wholesome, nutritious, great ingredients.  Makes for one picky kitty!  He won't eat any other kitty treats!  Highly recommended for finicky eaters!  Give it a try!  (Plus the subscription rate cannot be beat!  Thank you Amazon!)"
I love this tea - to each her own taste buds!,"I love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo, and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me. It's a sweet tea, which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinner.<br /><br />I see that others didn't like it, but it's really a matter of personal taste...different courses for different horses!"
I liked the old man design better :),"I don't normally add content to Amazon because the site is so huge, but I must say that this green tea is some of the best bagged green tea you can buy in my opinion, besides having good Sencha from Trader Joe's. Although it does not taste overtly like sencha or a nicer green tea, it definitely still carries the flavor but is accented by the lemon grass and citrus nutes they added. I always add wild flower honey or orange blossom honey, more of the wild fruity honey's taste better with this tea. Sugar tends to ruin the taste of it, so I prefer one teaspoon of honey and it is wonderful. If you like this, I would check out the ancient recipe for Hop Gar Shaolin Tibetan medicinal tea recipe Teh-Dah tea."
Good deal.,I always buy Nature Valley.<br />These are good and a REALLY good deal!<br />Two thumbs up!
Super flavor ...,"The BEST frozen pops I've found, and I think I've tried all that Amazon has to offer plus all the brands carried in my local supermarket.<br /><br />The flavors are bright and refreshing, not overly sweet, and totally recognizable. Too many pops end up tasting like frozen sugar water, with little or no fruit flavor. Not these. The lemon tastes like frozen lemonade; the strawberry tastes like frozen strawberries without the seeds.<br /><br />I've looked for these locally, but no one has them. Glad they're offered on Amazon, even if they are pricey."
"calm, yes... but at what price?","I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money."
Gift for my daughter and son in law,My daughter and son in law LOVE this coffee. I'm not a flavored coffee drinker and they are. She now says it is her favorite coffee.
One of my guilty pleasures,"I can get this locally, but for nowhere near the amazingly low price I get it from here.  This a is the real deal when it comes to tuna, and I try to have a serving 4-6 times a month.<br /><br />In the past I have used it in paella, but have grown to love it as a part of a cold plate consisting of the tuna on the side, with a bed of arugula topped with chopped fire-roasted red peppers, chopped red onion, sliced vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh black olives - drizzled with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451SCUU"">Badia Olive Oil Extra Virgin, 33.81-Ounce (Pack of 3)</a> and seasoned with ground black pepper and sea salt. But I digress ... this is high quality tuna and nothing like the typical fare found on US supermarket shelves. If you love tuna you will love this, and the price is incredible."
good tasting,Its a nice tea and I add honey to it.  It could be mintier though.
99% sugar-1% peanuts,"I agree with I hate it , practically no peanuts. I bought it because there was a couple of 4 and 5 ratings, but should have listened to the 1 rating. I purchased peanut brittle from another company that was delicious but they are not taking orders now. Thought I would try this, and I took a couple of bites and through the rest in the garbage. Save your money DO NOT BUY."
Kitty Showtime,"My cats RUN after their Greenies.  I throw the Greenies across the wooden floor and the cats take off - sometimes not for a soft landing.  They usually put the breaks on and slide around.  They love it when I throw one into a box.  I look at treat time as exercise time, and treat guests to a showtime."
Substitute in any recipe!,"This is a great item to keep on hand for the gluten free home. We have found that the pancakke mix creates great cookies and can be substituted in almost any cake style recipe. Our favorit is cream cheese coffee cake and at a close second are bannana muffins.If you are gluten free and starving for carbs this is a great way to get it done quick and easy. My gluten eating relitives prefer the pancakes, waffels, and cookies and make special requests."
best Prezels,"These are wonderful. They are a bit pricey, but if you want a Gf prezel that tastes JUST like the wheat prezels, then these are for you.  I just hope Amazon puts these on special again soon."
Good earth-friendly coffee but too much packaging,"I am a coffee lover and usually enjoy a strong cappuccino in the morning.  I tried this coffee and was impressed by the aroma and flavor.  It is not too strong but has a good not-too bitter flavor.  I really like the pods - so much less mess but these are all individually wrapped!  I know a lot of coffee pods/packets are to keep in the freshness but maybe organic and fair-trade coffee manufacturers could care a little more about the waste produced from individually wrapped items.  Needless to say, I did enjoy my cup of coffee and would buy this product again."
You don't have to look any further,"I love using K Cups!  Although I have tried so many ""bad"" coffees.  I have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that isn't bitter and has a wonderful flavor.  You don't have to try them all, this is a perfect blend coffee."
Great Healthy Dog Treat,My dogs love this treat and can't get enough.  I have had to limit them to one a day as they will eat these and not their food.  Very healthy treat and they even smell good.
Nice change,"The switch is a nice change from soda pop, and a great alternative for children."
My Dogs will Do Anything for Lickety,"I bought this product hoping to find something that will help me when I am trying to brush my 3 Siberian Huskies.  Lickety works better than I expected, they will stand for 45 minutes to get brushed if I use this.  Huskies are picky in what they will eat, but this is like cat nip to them."
Great Coffee!,"Of all the coffees I've tried -- and I've tried A BUNCH -- this is hands-down my favorite.  Great bold taste but no bitter aftertaste.  I drink coffee all day, and I like it strong and fresh.  It can be difficult to find a stronger tasting coffee that's really great without cream or sugar, I drink my coffee black.  I've not yet found anything I like better.  Yum..."
So cute,"They aren't so happy right now. I have them planted in the correct soil and with other succulents that are doing well but only one seems to be making it, going to wait it out and hope they make it!"
Mild but Tastes Good,The Timothy's is a very mild but good tasting smooth coffee.  I wouldn't say it is my go to coffee (Donut House seems to be that one) but I do enjoy a cup of Timothy's now and again.
Childhood Memories,"Brought a smile to my adult son's face with this case of Lemonheads! His favorite childhood snack, I sent these lemony delights to his bedside during a recent illness. The tart-sweet taste and familiar logo brought back memories of his childhood, and his own children became fans of this Ferrara standard. Pucker up- this is good eatin'!"
Great treats,"Dogs love them.  Even though they are kind of expensive, they don't have a bunch of fillers."
Excellent product,"We absolutely LOVE this coconut oil....and the price cannot be beat!!  My husband is weird,in that he'll cook eggs in it(YUCK!) but I love to have it on waffles or toast,or even yams. I also love to use it on my skin,because it's sooooo good for it! The consistency of the coconut oil at room temperature makes it easy to spread....if it gets too warm in the house,though,the oil does turn liquidy,which can be disconcerting. All in all,coconut oil just can't be beat!"
C'est Magnifique!,"Wonderful bold brew. Stands alone or with Hazelnut, Vanilla or half and half w/sugar or not, too. Tully's great blend! C'est Magnifique!"
"I could drink it all day, if it was organic!","I love this tea. I just wish it was organic because I drink so much of it! I only drink it with a little milk and honey. The milk softens the tannins and seems to develop the floral scent of the bergamot oil.<br /><br />I've tried several other brands that offer high bergamot earl grey but none of them have that wonderful scent that this tea has. This absolutely the best high bergamot earl grey I've ever tasted. I may try purchasing my own bergamot oil and making my own because I want to drink this tea at least 5 times a day, and if I'm going to be steeping that many leaves, I want them to be pesticide free. I just hope that I can reproduce a flavor that comes close to the flavor of this tea."
Great food ... if you enjoy cleaning up diarhhea,"I would give this food -100 stars if possible.  Bought this about a month back.  Slowly transitioned my 7 yr old lab to the food.  First time I gave her more than 1/2 cup she had horrendous diarhhea.  Not just once, were talking many times throughout the night.  Stopped the food.  Got her back on her last food (Iams...allegedly inferior yet never gave her 12 hour diarhhea).  Tried the Blue one more time with the same result.  Google ""blue dog food diarhhea"" and you'll see that this is not an isolated incident.  I don't know what the story is, but I have never seen my dog so sick from a dog food.  Not worth it.  No thanks. Proceed with extreme caution.  Don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />Oh and I live in an apartment.  An apartment I just moved into a month ago.  An apartment that is very nice and had brand new carpeting that Ill need to steam clean to get spots out?  Yeah, not too thrilled with Blue.  I'm blue allright.  Blue in the face from the mess I cleaned up tonight."
Instant Coffee,"As another person noted, this is basically instant coffee.  When finishing your brew, you will note that the kcup is completely empty....much like one of the hot chocolates.  The box states: soluble & microground coffee.  I gave it 2 stars because the taste is not terrible.  It is stronger than most American instant coffees and resembles the instant coffee I have tasted while in Italy....however, it is still instant and should be better referenced in the product description."
heritage red scarlet runner beans,"We had these for the first time last night, and they were wonderful!  These lovely red speckled beans grow to the size of a quarter and you can only eat one at a time, because they are so big!  Soft and delicious, if soaked overnight in boiled water....cooked most of the next day without salt until the end.....flavored in the Southwestern tradition, with a couple of hot thin chillies which we removed before eating.  We served these in their own broth with fresh chopped sweet onion and grated cheese, along with a side dish of carmelized mushrooms and squash, and steamy hot Dark Rye Bread for a fantastic meal!  The colors were devine and my darling husband even peeled slices out of the squash so they were stripped!  Magic!"
They claim it is in stock....,"...and then tell me it is backorderd.<br /><br />In fact, as of this writing, it STILL says in stock, even though they told me it was backordered five days ago.<br /><br />This has been happening with all of my orders to Chinese companies lately. They claim it is in stock and then take six weeks to get it to you. My guess is that they haven't even picked it yet!<br /><br />AMAZON: Please crack down on this practice by Chinese companies! It's ruining your reputation!"
Easy.,"This is an easy mix that takes only minutes.  I don't use the yeast, since it's not necessary and takes too much time for my chaotic schedule, but the flavor is a hit with my kids-- both for the pizza crust and in other meals.<br /><br />Amazon's subscription service is amazingly convenient!"
"Flat and uninteresting coffee energy drink, but low in calories/fat compared to competition","This product is obviously trying to be a tastier and better version of the typical energy drink.  With 81mg of caffeine, it will definitely give you a boost.  But it seems many drinks like this are either chock full of chemicals or are highly caloric.  I was pleasantly surprised to read that in this 8.45oz can, there are a mere 100 calories and 1.5g of fat.  Yet there are 4g of protein, so it's not just energy but some protein as well.  For those of you on Weight Watchers, it is 3 PointsPlus points.  The product is distributed by cCca-Cola, but is made in Denmark.<br /><br />Upon opening the can and taking a sip, I was surprised by how thin and watery the drink tasted.  It didn't taste bad, but not was not particularly flavorful or good either.  Perhaps this is because it is only lightly sweetened and has low fat, but there was just no body or interesting flavor to the drink.  I think it's just not good coffee.  It just tasted flat and lifeless.  I've sipped cold Starbucks left in my car for a few hours before and quite enjoyed it - this was nothing near that.<br /><br />All of that being said, competing products such as Starbucks bottled Frappucino has almost twice the calories, fat, and significantly more carbs.  Possibly this is why they taste better, but as I said before, I think the coffee they use in this drink is also not high quality.<br /><br />So for a light chilled coffee beverage, it's not a terrible choice, but not a particularly interesting or tasty one either.  I might buy it in the future, but it won't be a regular drink for me."
Happy Dog,My dog LOVES this food. He follows us around at meal time till he gets his food and then never leaves his dish till it's gone.
"Nicely put together, but taste of the products wasn't so great.","This gift basket was extremely nice looking. It was packed with snacks and cheese. What I liked most was the smoked almonds. They were a little on the salty side, but they were pretty good. The butter cookies were kind of stale, and I didn't care for the cheese that came with it. The crackers tasted a little stale as well. The trail mix wasn't too bad, but I just don't think it was worth the price. The boxes of snacks were pretty small, and if I had to purchase what was inside this gift basket, I would say that I would only spend about $13.00, and that would include the basket itself."
Great Flavor Variety,I live this variety. The flavors with meat give me the creeps and none of these have meat. The tomato/carrot is my sons favorite. I used it as pasta sauce for him when he started eating finger food.
"Was great, but formula changed!","My dog was on Canidae for almost 2 years and she loved it.  She was healthy with a full, shiny coat and plenty of energy.  Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic.  We took her to 2 vets and after several hundred dollars in tests they couldn't find anything wrong with her.<br /><br />I did some research and found that there were numerous people having the exact same problems I was!  It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package.  Do some research, it's not the same high-quality food it used to be!"
Outstanding cereal for your heart and soul,"Wow.  I love this steel cut oats!  My family is so sold on it, I gave my grandson a case of it for Valentine's Day.....what better way to protect your heart!"
Mideast Feast is a life saver for my siamese with kidney trouble,"Recently switched from feeding friskies for the past 15 years because one of my siamese was having kidney problems. Tried a lot of different higher end brand cat foods, Wellness, Evo, Nutro. He was picky about almost all of them except for the Weruva Mideast feast. He loves human tuna out of a can and comes running for it so I thought he might like it. Turns out even my other finicky siamese who has refused to eat anything but dry food his entire life will eat this! All four of my cats eat this like it's the best food ever. The only problem with that is I go through it so fast! The best thing though is that it has greatly improved my cat's kidney function and because of that is worth every penny to me. I will never go back to friskies and their corn and grain again. It was killing my cat.<br /><br />I'd also like to add that amazon has the best price on this food from everywhere else I've searched which is wonderful! Everywhere else charges 5 or 6 dollars more plus 10 dollars shipping. With amazon I get free 2 day shipping and a much better price. Thank you amazon."
"Fast delivery, described just as it is.",I have ordered these nuti dents in the past and everytime it has gotten here in just few days. Wonderful product. The dogs love them.
Great Breakfast Choice!,My son eats these for breakfast every morning and he seems to really enjoy them. It is a nice alternative to fruit and rice cereal and it has all the nourishment my son needs to start his day.
"Delicious candy, but do not order it in the summer because it will melt!","I ordered the Haribo Peaches because they are a delicious variety of candy.<br /><br />However, I ordered from Amazon in the middle of August. And it was 100° out. Big Mistake.<br /><br />They arrived all melted, as you can see from the picture I uploaded way up there at the top.<br /><br />DO NOT ORDER HARIBO PEACHES IN THE SUMMER! You can probably get away with ordering the Haribo Happy Cola in the summer though, because I ordered those too and they didn't arrive melted.<br /><br />I thought maybe that once they cooled down I could cut up the melted part and eat it. However, it was still way too sticky. If you have some Haribo Peaches and you tear one apart or bite into it, you can see that the candy part inside of the sugar coating is extremely sticky. Everything melted together and was really sticky like that. Not good.<br /><br />I'm rating 5 stars because I have eaten them before, unmelted and they are great even though mine were all melted."
good buy!,bought to have in the cupboard for my grandchildren.  good price. apple and peanut butter make a great mid day snack for kids and adults as well.
"Delicious addition to espresso, hot or cold",I've been purchasing and using the sweet ground white chocolate for a few years now.  I add it to my hot espresso drinks as well as cold. It's perfect year round.  The ability to purchase it in the 3 lb can adds to the cost savings I get over going to a coffee house to get espresso.
Got nothin' on Green Mountain.,Took a chance on these. AWFUL! I know Starbucks is known for burnt tasting coffee but this is ridiculous. I actually like their in-store brewed coffees. Never tasted coffee THIS burnt before. Try Green Mountain Barista Prima (French Roast is da bomb!). A gazillion times better this stuff.
Not Ordering Again,"Although these candies are delicious, I am experiencing the same thing as some of the other reviewers. It's a melted, sticky clump of goo. I am having to throw away about half of the candy simply because it is all melted together.<br /><br />Of the candies that are as a single piece, they are melted. The wrapper is very difficult to get off of the candy as it is often melted into the candy. The thin plastic wrapper tears and sticks to the candy. Whenever I eat one of these, I go ahead and eat two simply because I'm going to have to wash my hands after removing the sticky candy from the sticky wrapper and putting the candy in my mouth.<br /><br />With the amount of product I've had to throw away, any savings I've earned by buying in bulk from Amazon has been lost. This is one product I will buy locally from now on where I can inspect each package of candies prior to purchase.<br /><br />It may be that the Amazon warehouse is too hot to store these or they are melting during transport. The candy appears to have a very low melting point so it might be wise to store any that haven't already melted in your refrigerator.<br /><br />Sorry Amazon."
Disappointing...,I didn't think Hormel would make chili as bland as this.  The hot version is so much better than this stuff.  I was truly disappointed in this product and will not buy it again.
Hard To Find,"Plum Jelly/Jam products with minimal ingredients are hard to find.  This was just as my husband's grandmother used to make it.  A lovely memory every time he enjoys it, and at a reasonable price."
"Great coffee, reasonable price, compares well to other brands","I purchased ""San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast"" about 2 ½ weeks ago. Since then I've compared it to ""Green Mountain Nantucket Blend"", alternating between the two with an occasional ""Tully's Italian Roast"" mixed in.<br /><br />My wife prefers the slightly bolder blend of the Tully's; I prefer the Green Mountain. Both of us have found the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"" to be a good blend that's robust while not overwhelmingly bitter. It may well become our coffee of choice.<br /><br />Personally, I find the ""Tully's Italian Roast"" and ""Newman's Own Special Blend"" to have a bit of a biting after taste that I don't experience with the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"".<br /><br />I have friends who only use K-cups. I've given them samples of the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"". Their taste runs more to the bolder coffees. Both of them love the coffee.<br /><br />Several reviewers have commented about the sediment left in the bottom of the cup from the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"". I agree with them, there is sediment; it's just like I experience with the ""Tully's Italian Roast"" and ""Newman's Own Special Blend"". That seems to be typical of some of the bolder blends and especially the darker roasts. It may also be that the beans are ground finer on these blends to extract more flavor in the brew cycle.<br /><br />These are not traditional K-Cups but they'll work just as well in your Keurig coffee maker. I actually think I get better water flow through the coffee with this new design. My only complaint is the need to keep them sealed rather than in the carousel where I normally store my K-Cups. The cups are packaged in a very heavy plastic bag, which is properly vented for storing coffee. I cut the top enough to remove one cup at a time, then fold over the top and put a clip on it. We drink enough coffee that the 8-cup bag only lasts a couple of days. It's really not a big deal.<br /><br />Should you try it? Probably.<br /><br />I enjoy good coffee, even more when it's reasonably priced. I'm not a ""coffee snob"" and I'm willing to try new things. For me, the ""San Francisco Bay Coffee"" has been a good experience. I'll probably try some of the other blends as well. And, although I bought an 80-cup pack for this first try, I'm happy I have the choice of 36 or 12 count packs to try on the other blends."
Fresh and flavored,"I purchased these vanilla beans and received them very fast. The entire mail box smelled vanilla...<br />They are very flavored and fresh, great scent. Very good deal for the price."
No cheese flavor at all,"I was excited to see a reduced calorie, high-fiber mac & cheese product, and with such good reviews. Unfortunately, this has no cheese flavor to it at all. If you read the ingredient list, you'll see that cheese comes after salt - uh, what? I didn't and bought this item and will end up throwing away the sauce mix packets for the rest of them and eating the macaroni with spaghetti sauce. I think maybe the people giving this good reviews are new to healthier food and belive it is supposed to taste bad. That's just not the case - you don't have to compromise on flavor to eat healthy."
Yummy! Pamela's does it again!!!,"I absolutely loved corn bread and thought that I would have to stop eating it when I went gluten free. Then Pamela's came out with this super easy and versitile corn bread mix. I immmediately ordered a case having never tried it before because it was a Pamelas product and I have yet to find something I don't like of hers. Anyway, I would definate recommend that if you love corn bread because you will not be disappointed."
Reminds Me of Growing Up,"I used to buy these for a nickel a piece on the way home from school when I was growing up. Now I can have 300 shipped to me whenever I want :D They are so sour and sweet and tasty, it could probably be the best candy ever made, especially if you love sour candies :)"
Really Great Tea,"A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh."
"Earth friendly, but could have a little longer life",The bags start to decompose right in the plastic garbage bin for food waste under my sink in just 4-5 days. It starts leaking. I wish it lasted >7 days so that I could take it out once a week before the weekly garbage collection day. I have to take them out twice a week now.
"Excellent Chocolate, But Prime shipping Vanished?","PROS<br />I just LOVED these chocolates and received them February 2012 with free 2 day prime shipping. They were being sold for $19.20 and the shipping was free.  I need the health benefits of the 88% dark chocolate and these were very tasty indeed. YUM!<br /><br />CONS<br />When I went to order more in May 2012 (3 months later)  the price had changed to $19.79 and the shipping instead of being Prime 2 day free was now $5.27, so that makes the overall cost almost 31% more, just 3 months later.<br /><br />For a serious dark chocolate lover like me, this was so very sad.<br /><br />I  dislike the 31% increase in overall price in under 3 months.<br /><br />It makes me so sad. I wish I had some dark chocolate."
They run me over to get their Cod and Shrimp...,"Another popular seafood flavor that Sophie and Samson won't share.  When I bend down to place their bowls in front of them, they are on their back legs trying to get to it before I can put the bowl on the floor.  They act like they have not been fed in days. Nothing will disturb them - not even their favorite UPS man who brings them treats.  Can't beat Amazon prices !!!"
Worst food ever,"As a vet tech with tens years experience it is my opinion that this is the worst dog food on the market. Yes, of course dogs love it, just like people love greasy, terrible-for-us fast food. In general, people should choose foods that contain only a few ingredients, and as little soy as possible, especially if your pet has any GI problems or any sort of allergies (which mostly manifest as red, itchy, gunky ears), and if so, corn, wheat, and even chicken may be a problem as well. Getting your pet on a better diet will make them happier and healthier and will reduce vet bills."
Excellent,"Excellent, high quality product. In particular a great way to get your finicky kitty to consume more liquids, as the gravy seems irresistible even for the most picky of eaters."
AMAZING PRODUCT~,I can make Starbucks at home!!!  I love this sauce!  So cheep and so worth every penny!  Make sure you get the pump to go with it though it is very thick and will drizzle and drip!  It also lasts for months!
best tea ever,"my husband is british...so he knows tea.<br />this is his fave!  great price, quick shipping."
Big part of my day,A cup of this tea is a big part of my day and my diet to lose weight. It is just plain good.
Helps my leg cramps,This is the only product that helps my leg cramps.  I hope it will always be available.
Lot of food for a little one,"I got 3 sets of food for my 6 month old to have some variety.  I didn't realize kids are on stage 1 foods for a very brief period so we had to mix these stage 1 foods in with stage 2 and 3 foods to use them. I'm sure these are great if you have multiple children, but for one child, these packs are too large to get more than one, but one box doesn't provide variety..."
Wow! I liked them all.,"Emigrating often means giving up on certain life-long pleasures found only in the old country.  Like my mother's home-made rusks, so fresh that they would crumble and break when dunked too long in coffee (or tea).  But that's why we had teaspoons - to scoop the rusks out of the coffee (or tea) cup.  What joy.  Sadly, that was more than 9 years ago.<br /><br />Thankfully, I recently discovered biscotti.  Not just any old biscotti, but biscotti from Biscotti Goddess.  I must admit that a biscotti is not exactly a rusk (check your dictionary), nor is Biscotti Goddess `as mother made it'.  Yet, biscotti from Biscotti Goddess is much more than just a substitute.<br /><br />I ordered the ""Assortment of Gluten Free Gourmet Handmade Biscotti"".  Wow!  A good starter pack, except it did not help me to identify a favorite.  I liked them all, from vanilla dipped in dark chocolate to orange cranberry to lemon poppy to anise & almond.  Maybe I'll just stick with the assortment and dip in for a pleasant flavor surprise.  You should, too.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005PG0NOC"">Assortment of Gluten Free Gourmet Handmade Biscotti (12 1.5oz Sticks)</a>"
Moldy Bars,It does not state that these bars need to be refrigerated.  All of them got moldy in a short period of time.
Love these,They came fresh and they were delicious. I will be ordering more when I am out! YUM YUM YUM. Love the ingredients first and foremost for no unnecessary crap!
bland and hard,Bought six pack of these two months ago and have yet to finish the first one - no matter how hungry I am I would rather go to bed hungry than eat these ...
Nice not so sweet gluten free vegan tea biscuit,"I am gluten free and vegan AND I have a sweet tooth BUT I'm trying to avoid eating too much sugar.  It's a dilemma! I like to have a few cookies with my coffee or tea and these fit the bill.  They don't have a lot of sugar but they are still sweet enough to feel like you're having a treat.  The label bills them as having fiber but they don't have as much as you would think.  Still, I'm not eating them for fiber's sake but as a snack.<br /><br />Another thing I do like about these is that they can be used to make a really nice gluten free cookie crust for pies.  It's hard to find a gluten free cookie crust but I found griding these up in the processor, mixing them with some melted butter and baking in a pie pan sets up a great crust for key lime pie, etc.  So I'm making the most of these little cookies!<br /><br />I didn't give them 5 stars because they're a bit pricey but I would buy them again."
not as good as another brand,"I was quite disappointed when I received this.  First, it looked like someone printed a label from their desktop and stuck it on a small dark brown bottle.  It was very sour and not at all like another brand of verjus that I had previously purchased. I'm not sure this one was even from France.  I threw it out after I tasted it, so I can't remember exactly what it said on the bottle.<br /><br />The one I previously purchased - http://www.amazon.com/Domaine-du-Siorac-Perigord-Verjus/dp/B0008JEZ4K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1341338906&sr=8-3&keywords=Verjus - is true verjus from France.  It is very smooth tasting and worked very well in salad dressings and gastriques.<br /><br />I won't be buying verjus from this merchant in the future."
Water like water...,"The makers of the water claim that Essentia is purified through reverse osmosis, is electrolyte infused, hydrates better and has a pH of 9.5.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I didn't think it was particularly smooth - I much prefer the taste of Fiji. I drank 1 glass a day for about a week and can't say I feel any miraculous results. I can get just as well hydrated with water from my Brita filter and not spend almost $30 bucks for 12 bottles of water..."
Delicious!,Best ketchup I've ever had - gluten free or not!! It's so good I've been eating ketchup friendly foods the last few days just so I can use it.
Great color,I actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes. They looked great. Showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing. In great shape.
Delicious cookies,"My family has eaten these for years. They are great for dipping in milk, have a lot less sugar and fat than other cookies, and are a delicious way to satisfy a sweet tooth."
formerly a frequent Amazon shopper,"I had previously purchased this Pedigree chicken dog food for my finicky 1-year-old german shepherd and she loved it.  When my shipment arrived from Amazon I immediately opened a can from the end of the plastic-encased 24-pack and presented it to my dog.  She sniffed it and refused it, so I left it out for her. She kept begging for food, but I would each time point out that she had food in her dish.  She finally ate it, reluctantly, the next evening and then was up all night vomiting. The next day we smelled a dead animal odor that we couldn't locate. Sugar (the dog) sniffed it out for us at the top of the cabinet and we discovered that at least one of the Pedigree cans had burst open and was full of squirming white worms and rotting, oozing liquid that permeated the entire package. I felt so guilty for making Sugar eat something that made her sick, and threw away the entire package. Now I'm afraid to buy the brand again."
Green Mountain Coffee,I am so happy to be able to find large count packages of decaf coffee.  This is only sold in small packs in my area and that makes it very expensive.  I like the breakfast blend from Green Mountain.  It seems to have a smooth taste to it.
the best raw honey on the web,I buy this raw honey all the time.Great taste very hard to find in market & if you do they want over 5.00 a 12oz jar buy this you will enjoy.Just save some for me.
It risers,"Fine grade flower great for Pizza and baking bread, I add some semolina for fread. It's the best I've used. Bakes quickly with even color. Great for thick or thin pizza."
"Not as expected, unable to return","Understood this to be sugar-free jello when I ordered;  received regular jello, then discovered item was non-returnable."
instant coffee powder!!!!!!,"Not fresh brewed coffee, feel bad~!!Cream and sugar added!!Too sweet. I prefer pure coffee than this one. If I want instant coffee powder, what's the point to buy one cup?"
Great and good price!,"I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price."
Greenies Pill Pockets,"Such a wonderful and easy way to give your pet a pill.  And with Amazon, it's much cheaper than buying them at the vet's office or any store.  And, my picky dog loves the taste."
Cocoa...,"I have consumed many cans of this cocoa by Trader Joe's. It mixes well with protein isolate although few small clumps stick to the wall of the cup while mixing. It is 9 oz instead of 8 oz like most Hershey's Cocoa. Unsweetened, produced from apparently one source, Tumaco Cocoa Beans in Colombia. Unlike Hershey's Cocoa, it does not specify if it is a Dutch process or not, if it is certified non-alkalized cocoa or not... TJ will not even supply the information even if they are asked to do so. It works great with my mix and I would have given it five star if TJ would have been honest... Deduct two stars."
worst tea in the world,How this tea could get any stars is beyond me.  I tried one bag and could not taste anything...you got it nothing.  So next I used two bags in a cup to see if that improved the taste...still no taste.  At my age I will not waste time on useless things so I gave the rest of my order to a friend who also enjoys Earl Grey Tea without my comment.  The next day she asked if I wanted my tea back saying it was the worse tea ever!!!<br />I will bet they do not publish this review but hope they will.<br />Do not buy this tea.
box was delivered leaking all over my front porch,The box was delivered leaking all over my front porch. The person that delivered it had to have known and they snuck off without even knocking on the door. I have notified Amazon.com and have not had a reply yet.
Heavenly!,The absolute best mulling spices to make the absolute best warm spiced cider I have ever tasted!  Brew it up in your crock pot and serve a crowd or warm a smaller amoount on the stove top for you and a friend.  You won't be disappointed.
"Pb2 is good for you, tastes good 2",I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to enhance  all their blender protein drinks & shakes.  I was amazed how good it tastes.  The price  is affordable and as usual amazon got it here quickly.
Use it every day,"Just want to add my vote for this product - it's the real deal.  My wife and I have a smoothie every morning, and this is a key component.  It very much makes a difference.  There is a bit of a funny flavor, but it's more like a nutty, green tea flavor that we don't mind.  I love having a full serving of greens, including wheat grass and spirulina.  I'm almost 41, and I've also noticed I recover faster from runs and exercise in general since adding this product to my regimen.  Give it a shot - it's worth it!"
Yum!!!,I really liked this dark chocolate combination with the Fleur de Sel.  If you like sweet & salty you will like this bar.  It does contain 19g sugar per serving (4 squares)...so eat in moderation.  I would suggest that people check their local grocery stores for it.  Mine had it for $2 a bar.  So I will not be buying this online.
Wonderful Dry Food My Cat Loves,"And more importantly, it loves my cat.  I am the owner of a new cat that I started out on a supermarket indoor cat formula, since he had been fed dry food while at the shelter.  While the cat ate this other food heartily, he soon began vomiting on a daily basis.  I did some research on the internet and found that this food, Natural Balance, is considered to be among the best cat foods out there of the dry variety.  Since my cat would not really touch wet food at the time, I decided to give it a try.  Not only did my cat love it, but all of his problems with vomiting disappeared overnight.  I am currently feeding him a combination of Natural Balance Original dry and a variety of wet foods.  He is doing great so far...lots of energy...and he really looks forward to mealtime.  My cat and I recommend this food!  :)"
Finally strong enough,"I almost gave up on k-cups due to weak bitter coffee, but Starbucks finally gets it right with the French Roast."
Can't find in grocery store? Find at Amazon!,"It frustrates me when I can't find canned pumpkin in my local grocery store.  It is part of my regular diet.  I ordered it from Amazon.com and got the same brand product at a very similar price.  With no shipping charges, I found it a great deal."
My Dog's Favorite Snack!,"I was first introduced to this snack at my dog's training classes at petco. He really enjoys them! The pieces are really tiny but you can tell that it is made from quality ingredients (it also smells really bad), but my dog loves it. I highly recommend this product as it is a quality product that is actually healthy for your pup!"
Marcona almonds,These are delicious and were worth the trouble.  Local stores sell these nuts in small third to half cup packaging.
Not as flavorful and not as much versatility as you would think,"A long time ago, Burger King had this little promotion going on that had a little packet of cheese powder that came glued to a paper bag with your order so you could dump your fries in, add the powder, and shake the bag up and coat the fries in cheesy decadence.<br /><br />I've been trying to find the equivilent of these packets on the market. This wasn't it. Not only was this NOT it, this isn't a very user friendly product, and it's uses are very linear.<br /><br />>The powder will NOT work in any sort of shaker, unlike the cheese powders you see for popcorn. This makes dispensing the powder a little annoying because it pretty much as to stay in the bag.<br /><br />>While it does taste like cheese when you dap a bit on your finger, the flavor ends there when added to any foods (in a moderate amount)<br /><br />>Tossing it with anything wet/fried with result in large clumps of cheese gathering at the bottom with less than 5% of what you used actually sticking to your food.<br /><br />>Adding it to soups for flavor proved to be just as problematic because the powder mimics the old ""Ovaltine"" habit of clumping up in little bubbles of itself and won't mix in.<br /><br />Basically, this product has only one real intended use it seems: if you want to make your own macaroni and cheese that tastes just like Kraft, here's the powder in bulk form. Still need butter and milk.<br /><br />So I suppose if you are REALLY pinching pennies, this is a cheaper alternative to an already cheap meal. But there is no diversity whatsoever and to me, that's disappointing enough to keep me from ever ordering more."
The Fresh Mango is both of my kids favorite food.,"Both of my kids go crazy for these pouches.  They would eat several in a row if we let them.  With the little one you have to be careful so that she does not squirt it all over herself and she has made a big mess in the car a few times, but by 18 months she seems pretty good at self feeding with them. Definitely recommend these if you want something your kids will love and is hopefully good for them."
from concentrate and bad taste,"""Ingredients:<br />100% natural coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors""<br /><br />save yourself the hassle and get a different brand. it will taste much better"
Manuka Honey -,"I had bought Manuka Honey from recent trip to NewZealand. Paid almost $35 for 17.6oz bottle. First, I was skeptic until I used it. I occasionally suffer from GERD and took Nexium. I used Manuka Honey 3/4 teaspoon at bedtime and immediately all symptoms went away. I took 1 teaspoon for 3 days every time I felt like flu or cold symptoms and it worked every time. So, I was looking for ordering more. This Wedderspoon organic variety is not the same as original from NZ but it has almost same quality. Cost is almost same. Fast delivery."
Yum!,"I was first introduced to the Rub with Love products through the Salmon rub, which is one of my favorites.  When my local store stopped carrying it, I looked it up on Amazon, I was pleased to find the whole line of rubs.<br /><br />My favorite use of the Bengal Masala Rub is when roasting root vegetables in the oven.  It's also great on baked chicken."
My dog loved the food but...,The food gave him such bad gas I ended up donating it to my local shelter and going back to his old brand.  Change is not always good! lol
Gave away most of it.,"I really wanted to like this tea, but I just couldn't.  It has a slight sour taste.  I had to give away most of the boxes I ordered.  Oh well!  Lesson learned - don't buy bulk tea if you haven't tasted it before!"
Cheaper at local store,"It is my 7 yr old lab/basenji mix's favorite food, which we mix 1/3 can together with her dried food, making a single can last a week as a special treat.  However, after shipping, it is cheaper to go to my local pet store"
My dogs love it!,"Was looking for something that was healthy & That they may like well I've found it! Great ingredients & packaging and made in the USA! They also like Taste of the Wild :Bison & Venison flavor, I either mix these together or alternate the food. They don't eat as much probably because it more filling & better for them than chain store junk. Coats are shiny & they have more energy. They're happy so I'm happy this stuff is GREAT!"
Great stuff!,"I love the convenience and flavor of this product.  Sprouted beans are definitely better to eat than those that haven't been but, if you don't have the time to do it yourself, this is an EXCELLENT alternative! :) Great product and great company."
Great product,"These liver treats are great for training. We adopted a German Shepherd puppy and have been using these to teach her basic commands. She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this brand only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full. (Psst! - KV Pet Supply has the best online price- $24.99 for a 21oz. container) Highly recommended!"
Use to be better.,The Mario Onions use to be salty and sour. Now my husband who is a saltaholic says the most recent order is only sour. He puts about a tablespoon of salt in a freshly opened 3oz bottle and gives the salt time to marinate the onions. He says they'll then pass to his liking.
"blue buffalo dry cat food, basic recipe","Wonderful company...fabulous quality, but gave my cat diarrhea. I was disappointed because he suffers from terrible gas and I tried this food with him to try to eliminate that, and it did...it was a miracle, but after waiting and waiting to see if his diarrhea would clear up, I finally had to take him off it because the mess was just awful. Have him back on original, chicken and brown rice recipe...still has terrible gas :( Any suggestions? He really could clear a room!"
If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...,"UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road."
Healthy breakfast,This is a healthy breakfast.  It hasn't changed in the over forty years I have been using it.  The taste is great and you can use them as crackers if you want.
Yogurt Powder - The truth,"Do not buy this!!! I love boba tea drinks. I've spent a small fortune buying them. To save money I realized it would be cheaper to find the ingredients and make it myself so I bought this powder. This is not yogurt powder! This is yogurt creamer, BIG DIFFERENCE! Tastes nothing like the drink I'm use to. The powder itself barely tastes sweet. Imagine buying creamer and adding it to black tea that is what you will get, gross. This creamer is not sweet nor does it taste like yogurt or at least the fake boba yogurt flavor that most Asians are familiar with. If you want to make real yogurt black tea or green tea boba drink then buy the syrup and not the powder. Trust me you will thank me!<br /><br />I think this powder is used for making yogurt milk tea or the yogurt ice blended drink but you have to add the yogurt syrup, sold separately."
Best Kind bar!,I have tried all the other Kind Bars and this one is the best!! I usually take one to work and everyone always wants one. It's as close to a candy bar as something healthy can be!
To much cinammon and sugar,I bought this oatmeal at target trying to save some money on my starbucks oatmeal.  The price 1.50 was perfect. Im on a diet so im trying to cut on sugar.  This oatmeal would be perfect if they separated the fruit and nuts from the sugar cinammon to add depending on each people preference.
Awesome Flavor!!!,"We absolutely LOVE Metromint! We like the Peppermint, Spearmint and Orangemint... But the absolute favorite is the CHOCOLATEMINT!!!!<br />Chocolatemint tastes just like a Thin Mint Cookie but without the sugar and guilt. Far and away the very BEST Metromint Flavor!!!!!"
Multi-purpose salt that also works on popcorn.,"Not as well as Morton's or especially not as well as Flavacol, but it does work.<br /><br />This is a fairly versatile salt that can be used for any number of things, not<br />just popcorn or nuts. I mean serious, who buys ""Nut Salt"" right? Thats what makes<br />this somewhat of a disappointment from a revered company like Diamond Crystal, cause<br />IMO their Kosher Salt and sugar products are the best in the business."
Cheapest anywhere,My dog loves em. This is cheapest you will find these anywhere! This is my second time ordering great deal!
"Rich and Creamy, Extraordinarily Tasty!","Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce<br /><br />Rich and creamy, extraordinarily tasty! :) Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is an extremely versatile sauce, whether served on tacos, with oven-warmed tortilla chips, or just as a dip for hard boiled eggs, cheese sticks or vegies.<br /><br />Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is sure to be a hit, no matter how you serve it.<br /><br />Even Dad loves Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce, and he can be a really picky eater. Best to pick up a few extra bottles, just in case! 'nuf said! :) Highly Recommended! --Katharena Eiermann, 2011"
YAY! Cheddar Ramen!,"After finding this oddity in my local grocery store, I was intrigued and purchased it completely on impulse. I was not disappointed at my findings and now purchase it on a regular basis.<br /><br />Very tasty."
So what is coconut manna?,"So, the minute I found out that there was something called coconut manna, I couldn't sleep thinking about it!  There is so LITTLE information about it online, as to what ""manna"" truly was that I just had to try it for myself. Well, first what is it?  It's basically mashed up/ground coconut ""meat"". It has the consistancy of peanut butter that has been slightly melted.  It is also a little gritty too.<br /><br />I was under the impression that it was sweet but it's not.  It is as sweet as unsweetened coconut mash would be.  I was misled by other reviewers that said that it was soooo delicious and they eat it straight from the jar.  I wouldn't do that.  It's just plain boring.  BUT...I think it's the kind of product that would work well in a recipe that called for coconut flavor or texture like cookies, cakes, smoothies, and frostings.  But just to repeat, IT IS NOT SWEET LIKE PEANUT BUTTER!<br /><br />I rate it a 5 out of 10. If you have a sweet tooth like me, this is not the product for you.  If you just need an authentic coconut spread, you've got it.  PLEASE NOTE:  It may be too hard to eat at first.  In that case, warm the jar in boiled water for 15 minutes, stir with a butter knife, and let the ""ok"" times roll!"
Excellent snack bars,I bought these for my husband who is a recently diagnosed diabetic.  Right now he is counting his carbs and managing his blood sugar this way.  These are the perfect numbers he needs for a mid-morning snack and sometimes for a mid-afternoon snack -- the numbers for carbs and fiber need to be balanced.<br /><br />I like them because they taste good.  They are better than candy bars and better than most snack bars.
Delicacy for my dogs,"One of our dogs is extremely picky when it comes to food and treats. Sometimes he just sniffs and then turns away, obviously disgusted. Sometimes he'd take the treat in his mouth and then moves his head down so the treat just falls out of his open mouth on the floor. Then he walks away... He is an awesome dog but quite the character.<br />However, these treats are a big hit for both of our dogs..!! They aboslutely love this healthy delicacy. They are a bit on the pricey side but I will order them as a special treat for them once in a while. Highly recommend this product."
"Fudgy, clean tasting (no acrid chemical aftertaste) and very easy to make but too sweet","I followed the recipe on the box, substituting nonfat greek yogurt for the water and the brownies came out dense, fudgey, rich and normal tasting.  There was no unpleasant result. I found it too sweet but not as acrid as the standard brands.  It was on sale for two dollars a box at my local supermarket because I think my neighborhood passes over this product thinking it might be too new and fancy (and therefore untried and untested) compared to the standards - DH and BC. The recipe is the same procedure for making baking soda based quickbreads such as bananas.  This brownie mix contains sodium bicarbonate aka baking soda and no baking powder.  I added some inexpensive French brandy because the best brownie I ever had (not too sweet) contained Bailey's Irish Cream.  It's all Western Europe to me.  This was not a regrettable purchase for me but it was too sweet and the chips in the mix were unnecessary.  I should have added more cake flour and yogurt to lower the sweetness according the the High Altitude adjustment on the box."
Almost a 100% mark-up?  Seriously??,This can't be real.  I nearly fell off my chair when I saw the price of this item.  Do the calculation.  My local grocery store sells these for $1.99/can.  No wonder no one else has given a review.  No one is going to buy these for the price they want.<br /><br />Can we say *RIP OFF!!!!*
Love it!!,My daughter was born 5 weeks earlier and weighed 4lbs 1oz. In 4 months she tripled her weight on Similac Neosure. It's awesome for preemie babies.
This is the foulest Tea ever,These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill. I have many Teas. Let me describe this one. Get compost from a gardening store and brew that in a french press. The burnt leaf taste is pungent. Take the pills and buy some earl grey.
Molasses Powder,"Thank you for your prompt and perfect product.  I command your service,highly.  I will be ordering more very soon, keep up the good work."
good deal,folger is the best coffee this is also a pretty good deal like the size glad i signed up for suncription
No Complaints,"The crackers were well packaged and arrived fresh & unbroken the day after I ordered them using Amazon Prime. With the free shipping, the price I paid worked out to about 15% less than I would've paid at a local grocery store, so I have no complaints."
Timothys Donut Shop,I currently use Coffee People's version of Donut Shop and when I saw Timothy's version I wanted to give it a try. This is not as full body as Coffee People's version but I really like the smooth low acidity taste. If you don't want a bold rich flavor I think you will love this smooth great tasting coffee as much as I do.
"Fresh, With Plenty of Shelf Life","The Krispies arrived fresh with a long shelf life, which is good, because I live alone, and 4 boxes of cereal will last me a good long time."
Taste,"Everybodys taste is different.  This is a good variety pack to sample the different kinds to see what you like.  A few of the flavors were not good. I could not drink the Mt Zevia taste was very sharp metallic.  Best of them were DR Zevia, Black Cherry, and Cream."
celery salt order,Order came quickly and was as described in advertising. No complaint and would order again
odd flavor,I really did not like this tea. i general love chamomile tea and drink a lot of different brands  but this one has a strong honey flavor that totally overpowers chamomile.
Cheaper than Petsmart with Subscribe and Save,"If your cat loves these treats like mine do, this is an excellent deal. I went with Subscribe and Save, which dropped the price to 20 cents less per pack than I normally pay. Cats are happy, and I am happy with the treats!"
AMAZING,"this toy is amazing. my dog figures out most of his game/treat toys super fast but this one he just can't figure out leading him to work on this for hours and hours!! amazing! i'm in love, at least until he figures it out :)"
Healthy Stuff,"This stuff is great because it's low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and you'll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon."
A great little snack,"At first, I thought these tasted a little artificial. After a few handfuls I realized I like them, regardless.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this company's products, and have even gone so far as to speak with one of their growers about the integrated pest management systems they employ (using the smallest amount of pesticides possible).  I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line, especially the Habanero, is also excellent, as are the dark chocolate variety."
Yum!,"As a big fan of sweet potato fries, I was instantly drawn to these chips when I saw them at the grocery store.  I actually bought a few different varieties of Food Should Taste Good chips because I haven't seen them before and they seemed different than other chips.  I'm trying to eat healthier, but not give up all the things I enjoy eating and chips are one of those things.  This particular chip is a great alternative to the normally greesy fried potato chips and they taste just like sweet potatoes.  Apparently they are a combination of sweet potato and corn, but its still good.  Highly recommended as a snacking alternative to regular chips."
"delicious, easy, healthy","I used to get these from Costco and then they stopped carrying them so I came in search of them here. They are fantastic. I can heat up a pouch and eat it for lunch, or feed it to my one year old. Every single person in my family likes them, and I feel really good about it because it makes a healthy side dish, or as a meal on it's own. I can't recommend them highly enough."
I like them much more than regular pretzels,"My son's celiac so we buy these pretzels by the case.  I was never a big fan of pretzels but I eat these all the time.  They''ve got just the right amount of crunch and salt, and they're good for dipping in things like hummos.  My kid loves them too.  They're a bit expensive but definitely worth it."
Tastes yucky,This stuff does not taste good.  That makes it hard for me to drink.
Guilt free Margarita,"I like Margarita's one in awhile, and espessially like Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita drink as it is calorie free and guilt free Nice taste. I will order more."
Good tea!,A good assortment of tea.  Apparently the description has been corrected since the other reviewer posted.  These are decent teas of good quality at a fair price.  Good for when you're in the mood for something different.
Yummy Yummy Yummy!,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IMLJ46"">Amish Country Red Popcorn - 6lb.</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00017LEXO"">Amish Country Red Popcorn - 2lb.</a><br /><br />We buy the 6 lb. bag because it is SOooooooo incredibly good that we go through it very quickly.  I use a small amount of oil and a little bit of sea salt and it is excellent.<br /><br />Very few hulls on this popcorn so you don't mess up your teeth!<br /><br />Try it...if you are a popcorn lover, you won't go back. Not to mention the better health benefits!"
Best Jerky,"I first tried this in CA. It was carried for a while in VA but was no longer carried a few years ago. I hope it continues to sell since it is by far the best beef jerky. It is high quality meat (not too soft, not to fatty) and has a nice flavor."
"Mmmm, Mmmm, love these chips!",Love the taste of these chips; I guess they are a little better for you than other snack chips. Have a unique flavor. I only get these on Amazon when they have a good sale. Great alternative every so often.
Good coffee for the price,"This Kona blend has smooth flavor and good taste for the price.  I would definately consider buying this again as 100% Kona coffee is very expensive, so this makes for a nice compromise.  As long as you know that when you are purchasing this product that it is a blend, it is my belief that you won't be dissapointed."
Pancakes From Amazon,"My husband and I really enjoy these pancakes. They are so easy to prepare. The directions say ""add water"" but I add milk instead. We have them twice a week. I have them delivered through ""Subscribe and Save"" every month so we don't run out. You will love them too."
"Tasty, rich, thick frosting","This was very tasty. Also very thick. I thinned it out with some milk to spread it more easily. Will also go much farther that way, I say. Definitely a good frosting."
Worth the money,"This is my base rub for much of the smoking and grilling that I do. It is wonderful alone but can be ""tweaked"" by combining with other rubs and spices. I actually slightly prefer their Low Sodium Original Grilling Spice because it gives me a little more flexibility. For example, I like to tone down the salt on thin items like ribs and the low sodium allows me to do this. But that is parting hairs. I urge you to try this. I find it a little like a Herbes de Provence with granulated garlic, onions and salt."
fair at best,Very weak.  Why cant anybody come up with a good hot cocoa for the Keurig?
Dark 85% Chocolate Organic: Best dark chocolate I've ever had,"I am trying to lose weight.  I ordered this chocolate on the recommendation of my son, and he was right on!  Unusually creamy for a dark chocolate, it is luxuriously satisfying for my chocolate craving.  I ordered ten bars and am limiting myself to six squares a day but when I finally run out I will buy some more!"
"Necco, what have you done?","The new Sweethearts are here.<br /><br />Yellow is now lemon instead of banana.<br /><br />Green is now apple instead of lime.<br /><br />There is no white heart.<br /><br />The pink one, formerly cherry, is now strawberry.<br /><br />The purple one almost tastes like the old one (medicine), but not exactly.<br /><br />There is a blue one and it tastes like chemicals.<br /><br />The taste for all of the flavors ranges from 'soap-like' to 'chemical-infused'.<br /><br />Why mess with a classic?  Nothing was wrong with the old flavors, but this new candy is too horrible to eat.  I could not finish the bag."
"Boyds,coffee gourmet,medallion,ground medium roast coffee","Great tasting breakfast blend,we love it!Overall is a very good coffee with a lot of flavor.We use it in a french press and all my friends love it too."
Great Gluten Free Pasta,"When I had to give up gluten I thought that I would never be able to enjoy a great pasta dish again. All the other GF pastas I have tried were gritty, mushy, or just tasted offal, but Tinkyada Brown Rice Spaghetti has a wonderful texture and flavor. My whole family enjoys this pasta."
Caution: Kettle Chips are addictive!,These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese...it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters (like me)will enjoy these.
Yummmm,"Awesome product...It is hard to find things with low sugar, low salt, and low fat with a great taste. This product definately fits the bill!"
Overpriced Arrowhead Water,"First saw this item while in Hawaii. Item is not available via Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, or any other local retail distributor.<br />The only circumstances under which I would reorder is if the price is brought in line to alternatives, for example, the equivalent amount of flavored Crystal Geyser which sells 24 x 18 Fluid Ounces for $8.00. Do the math. The price required by the Amazon selection is absolutely outrageous, and doesn't include shipping. I cannot recommend this produce in good conscience as it outrageously overpriced."
"Bag keeps getting smaller, price stays the same","My cat has been eating this for years, and it seems that the bag keeps getting smaller and the price (for a while) kept going up!  My cat has very sensitive stomach - so this does the trick.  I just hoped it contained more meat verses fillers!"
Not enough flavor,"I received this as part of a coffee gift basket from a friend. It's very sweet, but doesn't have much vanilla flavor. I only need to use a little to sweeten my coffee, but I can't taste the vanilla at all. I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
Great,We usually get this at whole foods. Our daughter loves this milk. It is also good as a coffee creamer
Excellent oolong tea from Numi.,"I have been drinking Iron Goddess of Mercy for years. Perhaps I can't get over how cool a name this tea has :)! However, I only would try Rishi brand and in a bind, I ended up buying Numi, and I love it. There is a slight difference in aroma and after taste between the 2 brands, and while I really still love Rishi, I love this one almost just as much and with some raw honey, it is a delicious drink to keep you going all day !!!"
"Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-Ounce","Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-Ounce, this product was turned down by my pet.  Gave it to another who had three dogs and only one of the dogs would eat it and the other two would not even take it out of the hand of owner.  I tried this product because it was a american product, would not recommend."
Absolutely amazing product,"I first saw this hot sauce in the Asian food section of a local store.  Dating back over a decade, I've been interested in various forms of spicy foods, and this looked interesting.  So, I gave it a try, and it now holds a special place in my heart and kitchen.  As other reviewers have said, this isn't the hottest sauce on the market, with a heat level around that of Tabasco sauce.  However, the heat is where the similarities end.  This sauce has a wonderful, but not overpowering, garlicky element and a thicker consistency than Tabasco.  I use this hot sauce in anything that needs to be brightened up or anything that I would normally use a hot sauce.  This goes great in gumbos, stews, soul food, and of course, Asian cuisine.  I simply cannot say enough good things about this product."
Not awesome,"I thought this product would be amazing, based on the way it smelled when I opened the bag, but it was just average. Not great, but not awful."
Exceeded my expectations. One of the best chips I have had,"I was very skeptical about buying a brand of chips I had never tasted before, much less buying it in bulk.<br />However, I had not regretted it.<br />These chips are one of the best I had tried and certainly exceeded my expectations.<br />They're reasonably priced too so that is a big plus!"
aging classic,"dudes, you can't argue that there's some iconic sh** in this flick.  the characters are all killer, winona rocks in her day, and the b-juice is one of the ultiimate onscreen personas of all time.  wicked.  funny.  the scenes in the death waiting room are a scream.  for an old flick, this is good eatin.  i'm out.  j."
I trust this company,"My dog loves em, i trust the ""Newman"" brand after all he was a great man, and his family is committed to doing better in the world. and they love there dogs!"
awesome though i wish it was light weight,i love the green tea moisturizer from PROACTIV but its too expensive hence i bought this. This one is expensive too but it has more quantity. I love the smell and texture but even though it says wont clog pores it does have a little heavy feeling/oily feeling to it. but for oily people like me it still works great. will continue using it
Wonderful taste. Love these bars,This was the first time I purchased this flavor of lara bars and they are wonderful! If you love coconut you will love these.  If it had chocolate it would have reminded to of my favorite childhood candy. Almond joys.
Just as good as I remembered!,If you love HP sauce (you probably wouldn't be looking at buying it in bulk unless you do) this is definitely the way to go.  It tastes as good as it ever did and seems to keep without deteriorating at all (in a cool place but not necessarily refrigerated).  My family loves it on many savory items (anything from breakfast eggs to burgers and steak) and we add it to bean dishes and homemade barbeque sauce too.<br /><br />Unreservedly 5 stars!<br /><br />Just wish we could buy Lea and Perrins Worchestershire sauce and Marmite in bulk too...
The best I've had,"I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast."
Nice Product,You get enough in each package to make a good size cup of drink.  It is consistent in its flavor and the amount you get in each packet.  I have purchased it a couple of times.
Consistently Good Green Tea,"I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C"">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS"">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas."
Delicious!,"I was a little hesitant about trying this because for one, it only came in a 3-pack (and what if I didn't like it) and two, at 7.61 per jar, it's a little expensive compared to only about 3.00 for Skippy and 4.95 for Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter, but cheaper than Full Circle Organic Almond Butter which comes in at almost 10.00!  Regardless, I thought I would give it a shot.  I am so glad I did because this stuff is just delicious, absolutely better than any peanut butter I have ever tried and as an added bonus, it's better for you.  That said - it's not just simply almonds.  It does add evaporated cane juice (sugar) and a little salt.  It also adds palm fruit oil, but that particular oil is actually quite healthy for you so I don't mind.  I read in another review that they contacted customer service and discovered that they don't include the skins.  This explains the color and taste.  However, while you still get a good source of monounsaturated fat, calcium, vitamin e and magnesium, you're missing out on many of health benefits only found in its dark skin.  Therefore, I would still recommend that you try to eat whole almonds and other nuts but Barney Butter is still a very healthy option and I did I mention it's so very good.  I love this stuff!"
Not Worth Your Money or Time,"I bought these on an impulse at the store, thinking they would be amazing. I had tried toasts and crackers similar to this brand (in theory).<br /><br />They were horrid, I couldn't eat them by themselves, and they were too hard, crumbly, and over flavored. I attempted to eat them with laughing cow cheese spread and it didn't work, the taste was still nasty.<br /><br />In the end the only way I was able to them was by dipping them in soup like regular toast, and even then they were hardly bearable, or dipping them in cheese soup or fondue.<br /><br />I would suggest skipping them, they are a waste of time and money, unless you like hard, crumbly, oily, over flavored chips."
zinger flavor,"Fantastic bold citrusy flavor.  Not very spicy, but quite savory.  Packet size is just right for a single serving snack."
Wonderful all around seasoning,"I use this on everything from chicken to roasted potatoes.  You don't need to add anything else!  It really is a wonderful all-around seasoning with just the right amount of salt.  Also, the shipping was fast.<br /><br />Will definitely be buying some more."
Too Bland :(,"This is a Knorr miss :( BLAND, very bland. It's a foundation crying for other ingredients. Didn't taste anything like the Scampi I've eaten in the past. I'd only order this when deeply discounted to use as a noodle base for other dishes. Even at less than TEN bucks it was still disappointing."
Chicken and Turkey are a big hit but the beef is undesirable,"My cat enjoys all flavors of Fancy Feast except the beef.  He'll sniff it and walk away, preferring instead to hunt for grasshoppers outside.  I'm not sure why he doesn't like the beef as it doesn't smell bad...but cats have that extra sense we lack and I will take his word for it that the beef in this package is not all too tasty.  Maybe the manufacturers should add more grasshopper or mice parts to it!<br /><br />I gave my three dogs their beef.  They thoroughly enjoyed the treat."
Yumberry .... miss Wild Blackcurrant,"It seems that this Yumberry Blackcurrat tea may have replaced the Wild Blackcurrent tea.  The Yumberry Blackcurrant is good, bur not as flavorful or have the bold fruity taste of the Wild Blackcurrant."
GREAT!  Maya's favorite toy.,"It took a little while (15 minutes or so) for Maya to get used to this and figure out how it worked, but now that she has it has become her favorite toy.  At first, it'd take her about 40 minutes or so to get all the food out (I put her kibble in it), but as she got the hang of it, it would only take her about 10 minutes.  I put a tennis ball inside the jar with the kibble to make it a little harder for her and now, on average, it takes her about 30 minutes.  She loves this toy and I love watching her toss around the jar and fiddling with the rope to get the kibble out."
Damaged goods,The shpping package was fine. But the original package was battered and damaged. The cans were bent and dinged. Making the contents suspect.
Outstanding!,"These suckers sneak up on you in a serious way. Haven't met anyone yet who doesn't love the taste. After that, the camp divides into those who regret the burn and those who crave it. I set 4 cans of these outside my office, and they were devoured by our teams at work within days.<br /><br />P.S. Please get rid of that other idiot review here."
Delicious!,"Fabulous taste, almost seems like its flavored. Would highly recommend for the coffee connesseiur. Too expensive though. extra words to get to 20"
Teenie Greenie,Dogs love greenies. Awesome product. Super price. Item was shipped very rapidly. Great packaging. Overall wonderful experience. All animals are happy!
cat treats,the salmon flavor treats help keep my cat from being bored with the same treats all the time.  Plus they are very nutritious.
SO yummy!,I have a hard time getting enough water and when I discovered this drink mix that problem was gone! No sugar and wonderful peach flavor! If you like peaches you will love this drink. It allows me to get the water I need and enjoy amazing flavors!
"Yes, it is edible but healthy??","Seriously?? By whose standards??<br /><br />Since when are wheat starch, glycerin, cellulose, potato starch, bacon flavor (?what does this mean?) healthy?<br /><br />I bought this thinking it would last a few hours or days but my dog just gobbled it up in minutes.<br /><br />I love the nylabone chew products but I don't recommend these unless you have very large dogs that can eat them as treats."
super crunch,"These are excellent snack crackers, but you need a really good set of teeth to bite into them!  We have eaten them plain but they are probably excellent with cheese also.  The interesting thing is that once you manage to bite a piece off they are not hard to chew!<br /><br />Chock full of healthy seeds, these are great for either a snack or to accompany a bowl of soup or a salad."
Great Relaxer,"We have used Natural Calm for some time now, drinking it hot each night.  Finding the item on Amazon makes it easier and less expensive to enjoy."
k cups,I was shocked to find my k-cups were packaged in a zip locked bag. Some of the cups were damaged and expired.
not satisfied,I really did not see that this product hepled me in increasing my milk supply. Not only did it not help me but it has a bitter taste.
Delicious!,"I bought several bags of these at my local health food store for $2.99 each before I thought of mailing some to my grown children and granddaughter. I was delighted to find them at a lower cost with free shipping through Amazon.com...what convenience.<br /><br />My younger son's comment was, ""Mom, these are friggin delicious!"" They hike, bike and camp. His wife is in medical school, studying long hours. What could be an easier snack? Each bag has the equilivent of 5 organic apples. They're crisp and sweet, with 29 calories per serving.<br /><br />These are a hit with our family. We'll be ordering more."
Cat dental chew,Only purchased a small bag of this item to see if my cats would eat them.  Sorry to say none of the six cats would touch them.  Delivery was quick and in good cindition.
Spicy!,"Yes, this is spicy honey mustard, not just honey mustard. If you like pungent, then you might like this."
Good crunch & light taste,"Popchips don't taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  They are light in taste and big on crunch.  Great alternative to potato chips.  I'm not a fan of the BBQ flavor but I do like the sea salt & vinegar, salt & pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  Like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches."
Love these!,"These are my favorite bars, by far - just delicious.  I was having trouble finding these anywhere, so I was happy to see them available on Amazon.  Perfect blend of flavors, and they taste very fresh.<br /><br />They're so good, I may need to hide them from other family members so they don't get eaten up too quickly!  :-)"
Rainbow jimmies,"I used these rainbow jimmies for a rainbow cupcake topper and added them to rice krispie treats for my daughter's 6th birthday.  Obviously, it was a rainbow party.  The package didn't look like the picture, but I was not disappointed in the product.  I would buy from this company again."
Delicious decadence!!,"These are great!  And they can get to be habit forming if you are not careful.  I bought the whole case, because you save overall  versus going to the supermarket.  Very rich dark chocolate, crisp cookie.  Worth every penny.  Oreo, eat your heart out!"
Delicious for the Dog,"I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again."
The best - after just a bit of fixin',"At first I didn't like it that much because as others have noted it seemed a bit thin. But the flavor was excellent, the clam bits are copious and the real deal (not just sparse mincemeat,) and it's simply impossible to find any Manhattan-style chowder at any grocery stores here out West.  So, undaunted, I tried a few things to tailor it to my tastes, like adding thickener concoctions, noodles, etc.  Not much success.  Finally I tried flaking in a 6oz can of cheap pink salmon.  OMG, it was like I died and went to heaven.  Makes 2 servings, but the whole shebang, with the salmon, is 320 cals, so what the hey pig out it's delicious.  Canned salmon is so cheap and unbelievably good for you.  With this, it's the best chowder I ever had, and I'm going to order a pallet.  J/K."
Great Cookie!!,I recieved this product for free to test from Influenster for promotional reasons. Me and my daughters ages 4 and 7 all tried the cookie and we loved it. It taste great and it really is soft. My local store didnt have The Quaker SOft baked oatmeal raisin cookie so I bought the breakfast version of it and I love it as well. The cookies are great for all ages!!! I would recommend this cookie to people.
"An excellent, healthy chip","I got tired of kettle chips and baked chips.  The kettle chips are too greasy for me with a texture like every other chip in existence and baked chips weren't salty enough for me and got boring and stale.  These were a great change and I l-o-v-e love them!<br /><br />Taste:  It pretty much tastes like Munchos - which I LOVE - it's got that airy, crispy thick texture and it is perfectly salted.<br /><br />Nutrition:  110 kcal for 30 chips<br />total fat 2.5 g<br />sat fat 0<br />trans fat 0<br />polyunsat fat 1.5 g<br />monounsat fat 0.5 g<br />sodium 230 mg<br />total carbs 23 g<br />no vit a, vit c or calcium<br /><br />I love these because they taste good, 30 satisfies me and doesn't leave my stomach feeling heavy, and it is affordable.  I buy them every week I go to the supermarket."
coca cola in disguise,"Disappointingly, this fortified drink is sickeningly sweet and tastes about as natural as any other neon orange soda on the market. That said, it's not gross, just disappointing. The ""unfortified"" Izze soda's are much, much better---even delicious. They taste light and refreshing, as it were, not syrupy sweet and artificial."
Best Coffee,"I use the senseo pods in my Hamilton One Cup Brewer, the brewer cost only $ 19.00 and it makes the best tasting coffee no matter what type you buy, I like the coffee mix with 10% Kona and my husband likes the decaffinated.  Taste like European coffee"
Yummy!,"The Land O Lakes hot cocoa is better that the average hot cocoa mix.  A lot richer and flavorful.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It is a bit more pricey than the average hot cocoa mix as well, but worth it :-)"
MMMmmmmm....,I put French Vanilla creamer in mine - tastes just like pumpkin pie. SO good and perfect for the season.
Good cereal,"I thought this was a good-tasting, filling cereal.  I am not a fan of very sweet-tasting cereals, so I liked the fact that it was just a touch of cinnamon. I also thought the cereal was pretty filling and generally kept me full until lunch.  The only thing I would change is to make the pieces smaller, as I'm used to Cheerio-sized pieces and these were much larger.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a plain, very slightly sweet breakfast that will keep them going throughout the morning."
"Quick, Easy, and Yummy!",I just got a free sample.  I cooked it for 1 min 20 secs in my micro.  The kids and I are enjoying it very much.  Not too sweet.  Kinda has a walnut-y flavor though there are no nuts in it.It will be perfect for me to send the pouches to school for a day when the teacher's forgot to tell me there was a birthday.  No more need to keep cupcakes in the freezer at school. Now all we need is mayo packet sized frosting to go with it ;)
Good Coffee,We first tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend coffee when we purchased our Koerig coffee maker.  The flavor fit us both perfectly.  Now that's all we drink.
excellent price for great tasting organic raisins,I got 6 packs of these raisins and don't regret getting so many even a bit. They taste great and the price is better than anywhere else I could find - even our local coop cannot come close to this. Ingredients list: Organic Raisins and Organic Sunflower oil. So make sure you are not allergic to sunflower seeds.<br />I use them for my morning cereal and one pack lasts about 4-5 weeks as I use a generous amount in my bowl (in my opinion). My view is that these are truly organic because they are mostly smaller than conventional sunmaid that use chemicals to grow them bigger.
Great choice!,"Very smooth coffee, no bitter aftertaste, this is my favorite of all the K-cups. Shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged. Would definitely buy again."
Dogs Love them!,"I use these treats to stuff into their treat balls, and my dogs absolutely go crazy for them!  They are only 2 cals each so I don't feel like I'm giving them too many extra calories.  And I also like that they are small enough that they are perfect for the Kong Wobbler & treat toys that have smaller openings."
Taste great and convenient,This is my favorite drink.  Better than plain coffee.  I truly enjoy it and drink it every day.  It lasts me quite a while as I only have one cup a day.  Great way to start my day.
Good Taste with Hints of Coffee vs. Peanut Butter,"This granola bar tastes pretty good, but it is tiny - you will still feel hungry about 5-10 minutes after eating it.  It's not too hard, nor is it too soft - the granola pieces actually have the texture of rice krispes.  While the bar is advertised as having a ""chocolatey peanut butter"" taste, to me it tasted like chocolate with a hint of coffee flavor.  Overall, I liked it.<br /><br />There are 2g of saturated fat in each bar which comprise 23% of the bars 110 calories, which seems a little high.  You also get 4g of fiber, or 16% of the recommended daily values so you may not want to eat too many of these in one day!"
Likable but not spectacular,"I am married to a coffee purist who will only drink black coffee and frequently turns up her nose at even flavored coffees such as Natural Fusions Vanilla from Starbucks. I on the other hand love to adulterate my coffee with cream, and especially flavored cream. It's not that don't enjoy black coffee--I do quite a bit--but that I also enjoy the robustness of coffee mingled with more subtle flavors. The best combinations are those which allow you to taste both the coffee and the added flavor, without one overpowering the other.<br /><br />This is my first exposure to Starbucks Natural Fusions, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to serve the coffee to a group of friends and see what we all thought of it (including my coffee-snob spouse!). The results were positive; everyone liked it, but certainly not rave reviews. My wife said ""I like it--for a flavored coffee it's not bad."" I thought it was tasty, just a hint of sweetness, and not overpowered with vanilla flavor. It did not have an oily feel like some bad flavored coffees I've run into in the past. Overall it was pleasant, tasty, and enjoyable, but perhaps not so good I'll be running out to the store to buy more. I'd give it a solid 3.5. I'll probably just go back to my usual Sumatra beans or Kona Blend, but this is a nice break from time to time.<br /><br />If you're a vanilla lover, or flavored coffee lover, I'd say it's certainly worth a try. If you're a coffee purist, you can safely skip it."
Love This Healthy Snack!,So delicious and so healthy.  Fresh and crunchy - much better than peanuts.  I love these soy nuts!
"Great Product, great training aid",I got the Lickety Stik through the Vine Program.  I was a little skeptical upon ordering.  I have two dogs that both need daily medications and they also get vitamins.  It was always a battle to get them to take either and had to revert to the shove down the throat and blow on the nose tactic.  That is until now.  Put a little of this stuff on whatever they need to take and wham gone down the throat.  It took about a week and then I stopped using it and the dogs now take their pills without any treatment.  Highly recommend and made my life a little easier.
Heritage cereal,"I eat this cereal every morning with blueberries on top and unsweetened almond drink.  This breakfast sustains me until snack time.  The product came in a reasonable amt of time, and in good shape.<br />Thank you,<br />Pam Chaney"
Excellent!,The crisps are awesome. Give me English crisps over american chips any day! I recommend them to everyone. The smoky bacon are my favorite but the cheddar bacon are almost as good.
very good,"this tea lasted me for my hcg diet was extremely happy with the item. the units lasted and i still have some of the the left over after a whole year. I will be coming back for more, soon!"
Perfect base for making your own Puttanesca!,"I bought these 2 sealed bags last year during a sale, and I will do that again once I will have used up the huge supply I got with them. Unbelievable how much you get with these 2 sealed bags.<br /><br />Of course there is no way to re-seal them once you opened one, so make sure you have enough glass bottles or containers ready (washed, sterile) that are sealable. You have to pack the tomatoes/jalapenos/capers into those new (sealable) containers after opening and then store those cold (fridge). The other bag (that you get but don't open as you only open one when you work with it) can stay at room temperature until opened months later.<br /><br />I am a cook, I am really cooking every single day, and I estimate I will go for another year or longer with this one delivery I got 6 months ago. You only need a tiny portion (few spoon fulls of content) to make a good recipe.<br /><br />To make a good Puttanesca you will need crushed/pureed tomatoes as base ( I recommend Marzano from Cento, I get them localy for 3,50$ per bottle), onions, garlic, and these dried tomatoes/jalapenos/capers. I actually add more capers from a separate jar into mine, and I sometimes add also (vegetarian) Bacos to give some meat flavour. Then of course you will need good olives with it. I add some from my huge Roland tubs I also ordered last year when they had this big sale for bulk items.<br /><br />Recommended for any cook who really craves pure ingredients to cook with, NOT CONVENIENCE foods. Because you still have to work with these, and I would not eat them in any raw way. These are not meant for snacking out of the bag!"
cannoli shells,"Product was fine, however ordered on 12/17 and did not receive product until after New Year's.  Very disappointed will not order again."
Love Eden Pistachios!,These nuts are delicious!  It makes my day to be able to enjoy Organic roasted salted pistachios that are SHELLED!  Woo Hoo!<br /><br />If you do the Amazon Subscribe & Save plan you can get these at a really great price!  That's what I do.  Amazon has the best price that I can find!
Just like at the movies!,Our Great Northern popcorn is always a big hit at home and even more when we use it when camping.  Everyone keeps coming back for more!  Every batch is just as good as the last.  Quick and easy.
BEWARE! Will you drink 450 cups of tea in 8 months??,"Why is there no expiration information listed B4 buying food products?  ALL packaged dry grocery store food items have AT LEAST a 1 yr. expiration date. This should be deemed MANDATORY before one's decision to purchase.  If given the choice, I would have GLADLY paid more $$ for a product that wouldn't expire in just 8 months, especially when you have 450 of them to use!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067XXHPY"">Sunhill Tea Chinese Green Tea, 25-Count (Pack of 18)</a>"
YUMMY & AWESOME!! Very TASTY!,"I have an addiction to 7-11's Cappuccino, and buying one of those everyday adds up quickly. I have been looking for a replacement to 7-11's for sometime and have not found one until now. I decided to purchase this item and try it and do not regret it in the least. This is even better than 7-11's and a lot cheaper. If you like French Vanilla Cappuccino you should definitely try this, I do not think you will be disappointed.<br />I purchased the 6 pack from Amazon, not the 3 pack."
Anxious to Test Long Term Benefits,"Received my Coconut Oil yesterday, opened immediately for a taste.<br /><br />1. Pulled off the safety seal and the aroma of fresh coconut wafted out-very pleasant<br /><br />2. Took a teeny, tiny bit of the ""oil"" (it's a solid) for a taste. With the aroma, your mind sets you up for MOUNDS...it is NOT.  It's very subtle and not at all sweet and it melts on your tongue faster than butter.<br /><br />3. I toasted a waffle to give it a real test---Most excellent, a hint of coconut and I added a dab of berry preserves....very good.  I have a friend who sautees shrimp in it and serves with a mango salsa---now doesn't that sound GOOD!<br /><br />4. I proceeded to put a small dab on the back of one hand and I do mean SMALL---VERY small...rubbed the BACKS of my hands together to liquify and then distributed over my hands and lower arms.  The dab was so small it was almost not ""there"".  My hands were so smooth it was amazing.<br /><br />More testing to begin on the long term benefits - right now - very happy<br /><br />** Update - one of the major reasons for purchasing this product are the multitude of health benefits for consuming coconut oil---I just discovered one that is ADDICTIVE.<br />Keebler makes a new wheatable NutCrisp small cracker: Crunchy Cashew...a little dollop on a cracker and it is absolutely heaven---you can easily get your 3 (recommended) tablespoons a day"
"Decent coffee taste, but too much sugar.","This illy canned cappuccino is made with 100% Arabica beans, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa, and a few chemicals. It contains 100 calories, 18 grams of sugar, and 81 mg of caffeine.  Despite being pretty low in calories for a sweet drink, the taste of the drink is much too sweet.  Clearly they are targeting the drinkers of the very sweet Starbucks bottled drinks (though the Starbucks bottles have much higher calories).  I liked the coffee flavoring, but it's certainly not as good as a freshly brewed cold cappuccino.<br /><br />I would try one can before committing to an entire case."
Great flavor!,"This is a bold, assertive tea with flavors that will grab your attention. I love it best as an iced drink, brewed plenty strong. It's refreshing and wakes me right up on a sleepy warm day, even without caffeine."
Excellent Alternative To Milk - Vaniilla Nice Change From Plain...But The Shipping Charge - YIKES!,"Westsoy brand soy milk(in choices of Plain and Vanilla) is one of the only brands so far,that I have found that has an unsweetened choice in other flavors than plain - they even have a chocolate unsweetened but it's hard to find.If you have a Trader Joe's market near you, you may also find their own brand in the unsweetened variety.I try to stay away from sugar and dairy products is a thing of the past for me.I started using this several years ago. I have found that almost anything I used with milk, I can use this instead. The only time I prefer milk is in my coffee, and even then I use ""Lactaid"", which is a lactose free milk. Coffee-wise, I just like the creamier consistency better and also the soy milk seems to break up in hot coffee.<br /><br />I use Soymilk in my cereal, both hot and cold, and it's a wonderful replacement for milk or ice cream when used in a smoothie, with some ice and fruit(or any flavor you want to add.) Works great as a glass of soy with any meal.A refreshing taste, that, after a while you may even think is better than milk. The Vanilla, which is naturally flavored, gives just a hint of flavor to make it a little different then the plain for a little variety. But the Plain is good too.<br /><br />It's a a great source of Protein, with 9 grm. per 8 oz. serving,and 46 mg isoflavones, it also supplies 4% calcium and 10% iron in each serving. Ingredients are Organic Soymilk(filtered water, whole Organic Soybeans),Natural Vanilla Flavor With Other Natural Flavors. Per serving it supplies 100 calories, 4.5g Fat, 0.5saturated fat, 0 g of trans, 2.5 polyunsat fat,1g monosat fat. NO cholesterol(this is always a big plus for me),30mg sodium 300 mg potassium, 4 gr dietary fiber and 1g sugars (not added but coming from the ingredients). The only thing it lacks is the Vit D that is added to milk, so you may have to check around and find another source for that of something you like.<br /><br />Packaged in a slim 32 0z. box, with an easy pour recloseable spout, it has a long shelf life, and should be refrigerated once it's open, at which point it is usually good for about a week to 10 days. The price is about the same, give a take a few cents, as it is at my neighborhood grocery store...BUT-The shipping is so high, this is one product I would not recommend to buy on line. Maybe Amazon will eventually have a multi-pack site with the free shipping option. If anyone has come across such a site please leave a comment on my review - or if I come across one I will edit with the info-thanks!<br /><br />For dairy free diets, Westsoy is a good, healthy choice.<br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie"
Honey of a Deal! :),"I used these small jars of Honey as a promotional item/marketing tool as September was National Honey Month.  Gave out little boxes that had different types of teabags in them, along with 3 disposable coffee cups, spoons and the little jars of honey.  It was a big hit & everyone commented how delicious the honey was!  I recommend this product highly@"
"Okay, but this tea is missing something","This tea is not bad, but far from really good.  Sleepy time is wonderful, but this is just the base for that tea with a lot better stuff put into it.  If you want a really good tea, this is not it."
good but not as good as 2 layer,"I like these better than the larger sardines from Portugal or Morocco, but they are not as good as the even smaller 2 layer pack brislings.  The 2 layer cross pack are the best.  The extra seasoning in these neither adds nor detracts from the taste -- I can take it or leave it.  In all cases an olive oil pack is superior to water, fish oil, or some cheapo oil (cottonseed, soy, etc). It's really too bad that the Tiny Tots are so hard to find.  They always were the very best,by far."
Delicious!,"Whoever thought of sending free boxes of this to customers deserves a raise from Kashi and a ""thank you!"" from me.  These pita crisps are wonderful.  They are sturdy and crunchy, but not so much that they are a chore to chew.  They are labelled as Sea Salt flavor, which sounds a little dull, but they are actually bursting with flavor.  They are fairly low in calories; each serving has 120 of them.  A serving size is approximately 11 crisps and contains: 180mg of sodium, 22g carbs (5g fiber and 2g sugars), 3g of protein and 10 grams of whole grain!  All in all, a pretty nutritious snack that definitely doesn't lack in flavor."
Daughter really likes it,"I normally do not purchase foods that are not organic or at least organically produced, but my daughter loves this type of cereal and had not found anything she liked that she could eat since discovering she has celiac sprue. She really enjoys this product for taste and easy preparation. We do not use the microwave (health hazard--look it up--outlawed in the Soviet Union since the 1970s for that reason) so she has only cooked it on the stovetop. I gave it four stars for not being organic, but if that's not important to you, consider it a five star rating."
PIGGY SLIVERS,WE HAVE BEEN BUYING THESE FOR YEARS.  OUR 11 YEAR OLD BOXER/ROTTWEILLER LOVES EM JUST AS MUCH AS THE FIRST TIME HE TASTED THEM.
Cute tea pot,"Overall I thought this would be great but kinda disappointed what I mean is the colors of the flowers were not vibrant they all were kinda green sickly looking plants and only three teas I really liked said they tasted like what they were suppose to, I still haven't tried them all and that's because I don't normally like black teas, I'll be getting to those later in the month. I love the tea pot as my mother in law is always hogging the big metal one, so I place this little pot in the microwave and heat up the water and than have my tea, its quick and easy and the handle keeps me from getting burned. It is smaller than expected since it comes in a pretty big box. It says hassle free packaging but I laughed because getting it open was pretty hard to do. It is dishwasher safe and cleans up easy it is really cute and I love the pot, and it was fun to try something different I do love the tea but If I buy tea again I'm buying the satchel version and not this bulb stuff again as it can only be used two times really. It holds about one cup of tea. If you love tea this was more for personal fun, but overall not for drinking a lot of tea. Overall good starter kit for watching flowering tea but if your a tea drinker buy what you know and trust."
Powerful Punch,Taste is a bit bitter like most artificially flavored drinks.  But it does wake you up with a quick burst of energy similar to coffee.
I love Torani.,"Torani sugar-free flavoring syrups are one of the few things I can eat without barfing since I had weight-loss surgery in February. They taste good and make my main food, sugar-free frozen ""milkshakes"" made with powdered milk, powdered whey, and flavoring not only edible but delicious. I use the lemon Torani sugar-free with lemon juice in my so-called lemon sherbet."
worked but better to use a pot,I got this to see if my dog like this as well as he likes lawn grass and he did! It grew fast and was very easy however the base of the stems and soil got moldy after awhile I think because it is hard to water the right amount in the bag. At least it was for me. It is a nice idea though and it did work!
My two cats love Paw Lickin' Chicken,"I have two finicky eaters.  They will only eat Paw Lickin' Chicken canned food.  I've tried other varieties from Weruva and many, many others from other manufacturers.  My cats seem to like the meaty texture of the food.  They won't touch pate' type foods.  They'll lick the gravy off of foods with morsels and gravy, but won't touch the morsels.  They won't even go near wet seafood types of cat food.  It's this and Wellness brand dried food<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006MWNPM"">Wellness Complete Health Salmon, Salmon Meal & Deboned Turkey Recipe Dry Cat Food</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CNZA86"">Wellness Indoor Health Dry Cat Food</a>.  Needless to say the food bills are high.  This is cheaper than the four local pet food stores by 20% - 25% (two boutique stores and two chains).  I tried buying whole chickens and cooking them in the crock pot as it is cheaper than this, but they wouldn't eat it.  With Amazon Prime free shipping it makes sense for me to buy it here.  I still buy from the two boutique pet stores from time to time to assuage my guilty conscience because I'm not buying local and wouldn't have discovered this food if it hadn't been for the helpfulness of the local pet shops, but the price savings and convenience of to my door shipping is significant enough to get me to buy it here.  Buy a few cans from your local store to see if your lovlies will eat it and compare the price."
good flavor,It's not easy to find a good flavored decaf coffee in the stores in my area.  This one is reasonabley priced and ships quickly.
Bad reaction,"I loved the Amazing grass in capsule form. It tasts better and gave me tonns of energy. But i decided to get it in a powder form, so my husband can join me. I started it first and i couldnt understand why i feel very hot all the time and have headaches. I feel like im on fire. I thought maybe its a coincidence. But 4 days later my hubby gave it a try and he felt hot and had bad headache too. So, i guess its the grass. I dont think i will be using it again. I cant go throught the day without pain medication now. I will go back to the pill form. For some reason works better for me. :(((( That was a waste of money."
...No,"I really was surprised at how bad this stuff really was.  When I ordered it I figured with ingredients like ginger and lemon that it would make a satisfying hot wintertime drink.  But alas it was downright terrible. I heated the right amount of water as per its directions and found it extremely strong and bitter.  So I added more water and mix and this time added some honey for flavor and still found it too strong, and very unsatisfying.  Finally I cut it with extra water and that was all she wrote, it was still bad.  Worse I feel than the taste of this stuff when actually drinking it was the terrible aftertaste that lasts for some time.  An hour later I could still taste some of it lingering, and it was not at all pleasant.  I do not, and cannot recommend this drink at all...."
Charms,Haven't opened them yet...bought them for Book Club as we will just have read Lost in Shangrila. The survivors lived on Charms! Thought it would be fun to have them. Not sure what I will do with all the rest of them as the meeting is in November...
Perfect snack for a toddler!,"My daughter can't get enough of these. They are just sweet enough, that she will eat them. They are the perfect snack! They travel well. You can toss them in your hand/diaper bag and have a snack for you or your child!<br />Some basic information.<br />Per bag-(Serving size is one bag)<br />*Only 40 calories<br />*No Fat<br />*2 full fruit servings<br />*100% natural fruit!<br />*Fuji apples<br />*Peanut/tree nut FREE<br />*Gluten FREE<br />*Soy FREE<br />*Dairy Free<br />*No GMO<br />*Vegan and Kosher Friendly!"
My dog loves it,My dog loves this treat. I need to have it in stock in the freezer as we live outside US....<br />The best with this seller was that I got 2 for 1.  :-)<br />We have tried other duck stips but this is the best one according to my dog.
healthy and great tasting,"This is my second order of Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame, Wasabi. It satisfies my craving for something crunchy without going off a healthy diet. I have a handful at work in the mid morning or mid afternoon and it holds my hunger until dinner. This product has some ""bite"" to it, but the wasabi flavor is not overpowering, just perfect!!!I have turned on several friends to this great snack."
Cat owner,"I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats . Unfortunetly , I cannot write a review because none of the cats would eat it . This is also true of the turkey and salmon flavor I purchased at the same time . Guess they just don't have a yen for a higher end cat food ! Sorry"
Soooo Addictive!,"Unlike the chewy caramels which pull on your fillings, these are hard candy (which isn't really so hard) filled with a soft carmel center.  They are sooo very addictive it's amazing!  When you want just a touch of a sweet treat, pop in your mouth for a satisfying experience.  I received a package of these as well as 2 other new Werther's Original Caramel products as part of my bzzagent packet.  I am glad I took this campaign and so are those who I associated with that week as I heard not one complaint from anyone who tried them.  This is a buttery, satisfying treat!"
It's the best!,"This is the best coffee ever!  We drink our coffee without cream or sugar and really taste the coffee.  This coffee does not leave a bitter aftertaste at all, very smooth and tasty.."
New favorite from Annie Chun,"I'm totally hooked on Annie Chun's Soup Bowls.  Far and away the best ""instant"" soup on the market, I find myself frequently craving the soft noodles and intense flavors found only in Annie Chun's soups.  I have tried all of the varieties, and the new Vietnamese Pho soup has shot to the top of my favorites list.  Very savory broth, you will definitely recognize the flavor if you've enjoyed real pho in a Vietnamese noodle house.  This is not a spicy soup--if you prefer it with a kick, I'd suggest investing in a bottle of Sriracha sauce.  Obviously, one of the major selling points of Annie Chun's soup bowls is the convenience factor.  Nevertheless, this soup makes me want to grab some fresh cilantro and bean sprouts and have an authentic pho experience at home!<br /><br />Since everyone's tastes differ, as a matter of reference, my other favorite Annie Chun's Soup flavors are the Tom Yum, the Kimchi (although it's in the upper range of spicy that I can handle), and the Miso."
Delicious and Gluten Free!!!,"The Kind Healthy Grains line of cereals (I've tried both the vanilla blueberry and the cinnamon ones) are by far my favorite gluten-free breakfast cereals. They have a very nice flavor and texture (though I wouldn't mind if it was a little less sweet) and provide enough substance to keep me reasonably full with no negative digestional reactions.<br /><br />It seems like a nice, balanced nutritional content that will be attractive (and tasty) even for those who aren't in need of the gluten-free aspect.<br /><br />I immediately ordered this on a subscription basis as it's not yet available in our local grocery stores."
very good,turkey... it is delicious once you get used to the smoked taste of the turkey stick. it took me a week to get used to it. now i love snacking on them all the time. there are about 40 turkey sticks in each package. they are not greasey or nasty tasting. they do not leave a greasey taste in your mouth. old wisconsin turkey snack sticks are ready to eat. after you open the package you want to put them into the refrigerator and maybe into a zip lock bag. they come in one bag and it is not re-usable or re-sealable. their website is [...] if you would like to read up on this or other products. it is a good protein source and it has very little carbohydrates in it. freshness date for example from mine was: may 24 2013. i hope i was able to help someone to give these snacks a try.
You're going to LOVE IT! Carbonated JUICE not soda!,"SWITCH is 100% juice, but it is CARBONATED! Drinks like a soda, but it isn't--so much better for you and your family.

Great southern taste!,"I liked this coffee very mush! It has a nice nutty pecan flavor and doesn't tatste cheap! I will definately purchase again. Oh, thanks Amazon. Your shipments are always on time and undamaged++++"
"Cat loves it, but it STINKS horribly","I've been feeding my cat this food for about 2 weeks and my cat loves it. However, I feed my cat in the dining room and I eat my breakfast in the living room because the food stinks and the smell lingers.<br /><br />My cat seems very healthy and always has lots of energy after his meal. He seems very healthy and excited to be fed and licks the can clean.<br /><br />But I think I'll return to Tiki Cat or Newman's Own. I change his litterbox at least twice per day because I will not have my house smelling like animal droppings. I will not tolerate foul cat food smell either."
K cup green tea,"Product was as described. The green tea flavor is okay, it can be a bit strong unless you prefer stronger flavors. I would purchase it again."
What comes in a can can't,"I understand that, when it comes to coffees, something that comes in a can can't compete with the real thing and this 'issimo' doesn't. It's Cappucino because the writing on the can says it is but, Cappuccino or not, it's made out of coffee, a little cocoa, some sugar and milk so most ingredients are present. Only the the fresh taste and the fresh aroma, the froth and the Cappuccino steam are missing.<br /><br />Now, if we are to compare bland make-believe Cappuccinos, the 'illy issimo' that comes in a can is almost indistinguishable from the Starbucks version that comes in a bottle. How do I know? I did a blind test and I found it was difficult to tell which was which except for the Starbucks being a little sweeter and bolder but only a very little.<br /><br />My fair rating should be a bland 3-stars (It's Okay). Drink the 'issimo' if you must or if the real thing is unobtainable but it's coffee that comes in a can so don't expect the impossible."
"Sorry, But Not Their Best","Out of all of the ""ready-to-eat"" offerings from kitchens of India this is the least tasteful I've had so far.  I absolutely strongly recommend you combine this with some other starchy food like rice, naan, potatoes, or anything.  Eating it combined with something else makes it at least tolerable while eating it alone simply isn't.  The texture can be a bit gritty, it's similiar to eating food with an excessive amount of turmeric - even though it's not an ingredient in this product.  I say ""can be gritty"" because the quality of the product seems to be a bit inconsistent.  A few will be better than others, a few will make you want to throw all of it out.  Definitely won't be purchasing this one again!"
yummy,betty lous powdered peanut butter is simply YUMMY without ANY guilt !! Eat it off the spoon or for baking ! A wonderful product !!
Great to find this item,"I cannot find the French Vanilla Jell-o instant pudding in my grocery, but found it online and at a good price. Delighted as I use it a lot."
Same as in Store.,As far as I can tell this is the same item as you buy in the store.  All 14 items in pack were good (not damaged) and fresh.  Not overpriced.  I would buy this item again.
Worked 1st day!,"Bought this at Menards for two dollars cheaper. Had a serious mole problem. This sucker was tearing up the yard. I found his main tunnel going back and forth between the woods and the house. Did a lot of reading. Placed two traps on his tunnel, after pushing the ground back down. I set the trap as it is supposed to be set. Leaving him room to go underneath and push the dirt up again. One day later, and I got him. No more tunnels! Pulled them out and stored them for the next guy, if he dare comes. I am telling you, if you set the trap correctly and wait a day or two with a fresh tunnel, you WILL get him."
Best K-Cup out there if you like strong coffee,"Has the richest flavor. Other K-Cup brands taste really bad after you try this one. Flavor might vary a bit between batches, but they are all good and strong. It is a waste to prepare a ""large"" cup with this, since it can easily handle a ""large+small"", which amounts to ~400ml of rich coffee. If you like espresso, go with small. Worth every penny, thank you Newman :)<br /><br />PS: Decaf is equally good."
"Our new ""go to"" coffee","This has become our daily coffee. We were previously Starbucks (brewed at home) coffee drinkers, although I will say these are not quite as strong as Starbucks brewed coffee...not weak either though. I usually buy them at our local wholesale warehouse, where the price is a little better, but I come to Amazon when I am needing it fast and don't have time to go to the store. It makes a good cup of coffee, that I happily serve to guests. The only down side is that the individual packaging does not allow for display. Not a big deal."
Horribly disappointing,"This stuff has no distinguishable flavor to it, just a stagnant sweetness.  It is just terrible.  Black cherry, my arse.  Yuck!  And, these are its good points."
BEST EVER,"This is the best K-cup coffee ever.  Strong, dark and flavorful.  I have tried quite a variety, but if you like rich, dark, strong....this is the choice for you."
Delicious!  But Too Crumbly!,"I like Clif products in general and this one is also pretty good.  It tastes good and it has better list of ingredients than the more processed ones from Nature's Valley, etc.  But the thing crumbles too much.  It doesn't hold together very well and from the moment you open the package, there's crumbs all over you.  Just be aware of it.  It's tasty and crunchy as they say on the package."
No butter Needed!,"This is the best microwaveable popcorn I've ever tasted, and I taste every kind I can find.  The natural flavor gives the hint of nutty and buttery and all the flavor I thought I remembered as a kid on movie night.  I just wish they carried it in the stores around me. I was very happy when Amazon finally started stocking it!"
"Great, Healthy Cereal!","For a healthy cereal that contains no sugar, this is fantastic! Cinnamon and hard raisins are all the elements that the kid in me enjoys when eating these healthy grains."
THE Best Healthy Cookies Out There!,"These chocolate chip cookies are addicting! They are the best tasting cookies out there, and they are healthy for you too! They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!"
Our dogs LOVE,Our dogs love the Everlasting Vanilla Mint!  One dog will licks and the other dog chews but it takes them a long time to finish them when they are in the treat balls.  The treat ball has provided them with hours of entertainment this winter when we haven't been able to get out much.  We have tried the Chicken and Liver flavors as well but the vanilla mint is by far the favorite.
very happy,very happy with price and taste of this coffee we rate it one of the better tasting coffees that we have used
Addictive,"These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."
Value for money but watch out sugar content,Got this product at about the same price at local Costco too.<br />Like the taste but sugar content is really high.<br />I think only by making bars at home(which I cannot ) one can control the sugar and calorie intake.<br />Hence most of the days I snack only on nuts
My favorite peppermint tea,Perfect tea for right before bedtime relaxing. Have been enjoying stash peppermint tea for years.
Best unsalted chips,These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.  They came when you said they would.
Helpful transition to gluten free!,"After my husband was diagnosed with celiac disease 9 months ago, I, as the chef in the house, decided it would be easier to have a gluten free home to avoid cross contamination or accidental ingestion of gluten.  I tried Pamela's baking mix because of the good reviews, the price, and of course the convenience.  I have used this mix in a number of bisquick casserole type recipes without a problem.  We have made many of the recipes on the package and on Pamela's website with great success.  This starting off point has given me the courage to try baking with other flours as well, but there will always be a bag of Pamela's on our shelf!"
Didn't really care for it.,"Something just didnt taste right about this oatmeal.  Maybe I am just spoiled by my quaker. lol  Anyway, I gave it away."
Orange Marmalade,Cannot beat the price. Just a little too sweet and not sure about the invert sugar in the contents. Cannot find exactly what that term means. Other then that very happy with purchase.
Tasty and good value,"I have been buying this brand of raspberries some time from various grocery stores, but they are hard to find.  Also they are often >$4 at the grocery store.  The berries are pretty mushy, but they have a great flavor.  I like to add them to plain yoghurt as a snack.<br /><br />UPDATE- I have ordered several cases through Amazon and a couple of the cans are usually dented."
Like pickin' an apple and drinkin' it!,"This is one of the best apple flavored bevorages I've ever had.  It's right up there with that fancy sparkling apple juice that you get in those bottles that look like champagne.  The difference is that it's a bit on the sour side, and I like that.  It's like pickin' a just-ripe-enough apple off the tree and drinking it.  Yum!"
"Should be called ""Tragic Shell""","I bought this product and another brand (very well known for their chocolate) and did a taste test.  The Smucker's brand was quite NASTY!  It doesn't even remotely taste like chocolate, and it doesn't harden like the other brand.  I love Smuckers Jams & Jellies, but they just don't have what it takes to make this chocolate topping.  Smuckers's, please do us a favor and stick to jams and jellies."
Great tasting gluten free cracker,"They seem a bit pricey, but they don't have the aftertaste other GF crackers have had.  It was nice to get a case so we don't run out so fast and I can share them with friends.  It will be great when GF products are so popular the price comes down."
Crumby packaging,"These are extremely thin, delicate cookies. They are delicious, but I will not order them from Amazon again. I sent them as a gift and my friend reported that only half the cookies weren't broken. Almost half of them were reduced to crumbs, and a few were broken into pieces large enough to handle. They were sent in a box with no padding, just a couple of air-filled bags, one of which was completely deflated. Such a disappointment!"
Pleasant drinking tea,"This tea isn't quite as full bodied as some other Assams but still has a great flavor. The quality is good: the leaves are small tips and there is very little tea ""dust"" or stems in the bag.<br /><br />I have blended this 1:1 with Stash's Organic Ceylon for an easy drinking English-style tea."
Basic Dandruff Shampoo,"The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and cleaning.<br /><br />FRAGRANCE<br /><br />Typical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Strong & Full), with a price between the two extremes, also has a fragrance somewhere in the middle. It smells good, but is also very subtle.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />Another review nailed the texture as ""melted ice cream."" More importantly, it lathers well enough, though it is a bit hard to spread through long hair.<br /><br />CLEANING<br /><br />My hair feels clean, but not squeaky clean.  It is similar to other creamy dandruff shampoos in this aspect.  Conditioner is not included, and if you normally use it, you will want to use it with this product as well.  My hair felt pretty dry after this alone.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Clear Strong & Full shampoo is a very standard shampoo, seeming to excel at being middle-of-the-road in every aspect.  It will probably neither excite or disappoint you."
Wonderful product!,"These chew strips are a welcomed treat for my dog.  She has no idea that they are helping her teeth stay healthy. Although she is twelve years old now, her teeth are in great shape.  Her vet suggested their use about five years ago, and since then she has been getting two chew strips a day. I truly think it does make a difference in the overall cleanliness of her teeth.  The only improvement I would like to ""smell"" in them would be a breath freshener!"
"Great Product, Great Price","These bully sticks are thick! My dogs love them! I am not dissappointed at all. The price is great and the product is wonderful. Will definitely be ordering again! I have paid as much as $20.00 for two thick bully sticks in the pet store, to have them disappear in 10 minutes! I have found that not all bully sticks in a package, regardless of where they are purchased, last the same amount of time. Some are easily devoured and some take a little longer. It also depends on your dog, if they are agressive chewers, then they tend to last less time. My German Shepherd is sometimes a leisurely chewer and one of these sticks can last as long as an entire day! Other times, she can go through a stick in minutes. They are a favorite for us. We have noticed no odor as well."
"Bright, Bold, and Beautiful  Colors",I love Americolor. You always get fantastic coloring and they are so easy to use. Unlike other brands you don't have add a lot(which changes the flavor)to achieve the color you want.
Hard to find this product in the south!,"I've been buying Cream of Wheat from Amazon for a while now because here in the south, where I live, you'll find an entire row dedicated to grits, and if you are lucky, one dusty overpriced box of Cream of Wheat.  The sad part about that is Cream of Wheat is much healthier for people than grits are.<br /><br />Cream of Wheat is so easy to cook, just boil some water and stir in some Cream of Wheat, stirring slowly for a minute or two.  A little goes a long way and you'll want to start with less Cream of Wheat, as it thickens when it cools.  I like it thick, but sometimes I make it too thick, and it's not palatable that way.<br /><br />I just put a bit of sugar on mine.  No milk and no butter.  A bowl of Cream of Wheat not only tastes good to me, but it fills me up, satisfies me, and keeps me full for hours.  I can't compare Cream of Wheat to any other kind of cereal.  It's just that good.  I have been eating it since I was a child and I'm 48 now, and will continue eating it!  An added bonus is that it is high in iron and also adds lots of fiber to your daily diet.  It's just the best!"
Great Chips!,"I absolutely love Pop Chips.  Cheddar is my favorite, but I thought I'd try these cause I like Parmesan too.  Just a word of caution....you'd better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor. All in all, these are great chips if you're watching your weight.  They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips."
Average,"Is this hot chocolate....yes<br />Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta<br />Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping."
Excellent BBQ sauce,"This barbecue sauce is wonderful! If you are looking for a good barbecue sauce and don't feel like making your own, this is perfect! Keep in mind this isn't your traditional barbecue sauce (i.e. store bought crap), but this is the perfect addition to any fridge, barbecue or anyone looking to try a well made condiment. Don't let other people fool you, this tastes well by itself! Sure you can add sugar or ketchup, but if you wanted KC masterpiece crap, then go buy KC masterpiece crap. Five stars for sure!"
Not as good as others with this high of cocoa.,"We are big fans of high % Cocoa chocolate bars.  These ones tasted a little ""waxy"" and not as good as some others."
Supreme Chocolate Makes My Heart Sing!,"Instead of creamer and sugar, I add a packet of this to my eight ounces of freshly ground coffee each morning! For a mere 140 calories, I enter bliss! Comparable, both in yummy-ness and nutritionally, to a whole milk Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino®, this Supreme Chocolate mix comes in at 3 grams of saturated fat (30 calories, 14% DV, from hydrogenated soybean oil and coconut oil), 0 trans fat, and 24 grams of sugars (sugar and corn syrup solids). As for price, since I live three hours from the nearest Wal-Mart, the shipped price is actually a little better than I would pay locally, and it arrives practically overnight. The entire box of 72 packets is only 7""x7""x18"", and consists of six smaller display type boxes of twelve packets each. These 6""x7""x3.5"" display boxes will tuck neatly into the smallest kitchen upper cabinets, and will maintain the individually wrapped single serving packets in a neat upright position. All in all, this is a big luxury for a little price, which is something that makes my heart sing!"
Older cat acting like a kitten again!,"I recently adopted two cats and transitioned them to Evolution food. They like the taste and try to break into the closet where we store the food. My older cat is obese and used to just lie around, couldn't jump up on the bed, and threw up a lot. Since putting her on Evolution food, she is gradually losing weight, plays with the other cat, can jump, and throws up a lot less. I know lots of other people whose animals have been healthy on Evolution food for years."
Spice Happy,I am completely happy with my purchase of the Cardamom pods.  They were received in a timely manner.  The price was a steal. The pods are flavorful and of a better quality than others I have purchased previously.
Great Taste - Goes fast,Everyone in the family (and my daughter's friends) like these.  Even though you get 12 bags they don't last long.  Need to refill every few months.
AMAZON HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH HIS VENDORS,"I RECEIVE TODAY MY ORDER OF SLIM JIM,BUT I FEEL BAD BECAUSE I DID NOT RECEIVE WHAT I ORDER :<br />  1] I ORDER THE SLIM JIM PERFECT ON THE GO SNACK (100) COUNTS AND A WEIGHT OF 3 POUNDS , THE WORDING PERFECT ON THE GO SNACK WAS PRINTED CLEARLY IN THE BOX , TODAY THAT I ACCES THE WEBSITE , THERE IS A DIFFERENT PICTURE OF THE BOX.<br />  2) WHAT I RECEIVE IS THE SLIM JIM MEAT STICKS ORIGINAL .28 ONZ (100) STICKS WITH A WEIGHT OF 1 POUND AND 12 ONZ.THIS COST $ 19.23 AND THE ONE I ORDER IS $ 22.31<br />  3) THE COMPANY THAT SOLD ME THE BOX IS EAUCTION,LLC , AND THE ONE THAT APPEARS NOW IN THE WEBSITE IS AZ PERFUME.<br />  THE THING IS THAT I HAVE BEEN CUSTOMER OF AMAZON FOR A LONG TIME , I TRUST THE CO AND I NEVER HAVE A COMPLAINT , IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE MORE CAREFUL BUYING FROM YOUR COMPANY.<br /><br />  MANUEL SANCHEZ<br />  mas2348@aol.com"
The BEST oats - just like my grandma from Ireland made,"Hearty and filling.  Didn't think I'd ever find oats to make oatmeal like my grandma made (I'm over 50, so we're talking ""old school"" here).  This is as close as it gets.  Nice to know it's made in a gluten-free plant for those with celiac disease."
Light,"I like this product. I just cut my hair, and I have a teeny, weeny afro (TWA). Since I co-wash my hair daily (some people don't), I put this on my scalp using the tip. I drag it across my scalp in different places while I apply light pressure on the bottle. That way only a little bit at a time comes out of the bottle.<br /><br />Even if you're not black, or don't have ""ethnic"" hair, you can use this too, You can use it directly on your scalp the night before you wash it. That allows the oils time to sink into your scalp. OR, you can apply it to the ends of your hair to help prevent split ends. I taught my (Caucasian) roommate this in college. Use it on the ends or use it on your scalp the night before.<br /><br />I do find the oil to be light, but that a little bit goes a long way. I don't use it in the mornings, since, although I have a short haircut, I'm not looking for my hair to be oily - just moisturized."
A great alternative to oats,Quinoa makes a great tasting hot cereal. We have been eating it for a year or so now. It was good to get a seven pack and for a good price from Amazon.
Sumatra Reserve coffee for Keurig Brewing System,"Excellent product and I appreciate getting the quanity as I am supplying the coffee maker at work...it goes fast and allows our section to not leave the department to get coffee.  Sumatra reserve is an excellent bold flavor for a hard core coffee drinker, plus the Keurig brewing system preserves the favor.<br /><br />As long as it is offered I will continue to purchase it this way."
Introduces children to Artificial Sweetners,"Contains Sorbitol which makes the cereal taste artificially sweet, not a good thing for children to get used to as it gives an increased craving for sweetness."
blah,"very sweet and not too salty, with a somewhat odd, very starchy taste like raw corn. Pretty small portion but as a snack it's relatively low in calories. I think I would have enjoyed these a lot more if the corn  had been toasted to bring out some more complexity in flavor. They're just really plain and uninspiring. Don't think I'd buy them again."
LOVE THIS PRODUCT,I love popchips and especially when they are in individual portion sizes and a variety of flavors...good for you and tastes great and are easy to put in lunches or snacks on the go!
Alessi soups rock,"Yummy product. Delivered promptly and we love their soups! Love the fact that they sell in quantity and would like to see more than 6 packs, as well as variety pack!  Thank you for carrying Alessi at Amazon!"
NOT GLUTEN FREE!,"I purchased this product for a family member who has Celiac Disease.  The discription says ""Gluten Free"".  It is not!  It has Barley in it."
"Would buy again, but not for a gift.","I really enjoyed this selection of k cups for my new Keurig. There was a really nice variety and I received one of at least every kind that was featured. Overall, the selection was great. However, I am glad that I did not purchase this item as a gift because the ""gift box"" looked almost as if an animal had ravaged it. It was torn in multiple places and basically falling apart. If I was giving this as a gift I would have had no choice but to re-package it. I would definitely buy this again for my own use, but would be cautious if buying it as a gift, especially if I were having it sent directly."
Oh please... get an envelope and some hot water,"All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior."
Great Popcorn!,Great popcorn at a great price.<br /><br />I use the 8oz bags in my popcorn machine 8oz popper I bought from from Discount Tommy. The popper and the 8oz bags have been a<br />big hit with the family and the kids friends for every movie night and sporting event we watch.<br /><br />My 8oz popper creates enough popcorn for all the friends and they all love it.<br /><br />If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these. The popcorn tastes delicious. I have bought 3 cases over the years and will be back to Discount Tommy when I need more.
Too much turmeric for chicken soup,This was a great disappointment.  I didn't relize it has turmeric in it and the flavors are not good.  It turns the soup an ugly yellow and had an awful taste.  We threw the soup away.
"Singed Phoenix's Review: Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages","Taste: The taste was mild, not bitter. I enjoyed the infusion of vanilla flavoring, which wasn't too strong. All around good coffee.<br /><br />Serving sizes: I really didn't use a full suggested size of the grounds. I just don't like that strong of coffee. So each bag for me will produce around 100 cups.<br /><br />Cost: If you do the math, 100 cups of Starbucks barista prepared coffee is about $275 dollars compared to the $7.50 you paid for make it yourself option. I think it's self-evident what is the greater value in this matter.<br /><br />Summation: If you want a little variety in your daily coffee dose, and enjoy a moderately strong coffee, then this should be a given choice for you to make."
Baba Ghanouge,This is a very good eggplant dip. I am from the middle east and we make this at home. It is so close to home made. the only thing I like to add to this is a little more Garlic and it is perfect.<br />Spread on pitta bread  and enjoy.
My all time favorite tea,I love this stuff! It's been my favorite for nearly a decade. I start every morning with a cup of Tazo Chai tea. Stir in some milk and a bit of sugar and it's perfect. It's spicy and bold. Perfect to wake up with.
Disappointed,"My husband said this wasn't bad, but I found it so acidic and unpleasant that I couldn't even finish my first cup. It brewed up nice and dark, and I could smell the florals and berries in the aroma as advertised on the packaging. Unfortunately, it tasted like a combination of Lipton tea and Folgers. I had been expecting good things from Fair Trade Organic coffee, but this didn't deliver."
soooooooo good!,"These bars are great! Our whole family loves these. We use them for lunches, snacks, and always keep one in my purse for emergencies :)"
Great for Angry Bird themed birthday party,I bought Angry Bird Fruit Gummies for a kids Angry Bird themed birthday party.  They made a great goody for the goody bags that the kids took home.  The kids liked and them enjoyed them.  As an adult I was not thrilled with the taste but they worked great for the party.
Incredible Coffee!!,I've loved Dark Magic since I discovered it shortly after buying my Keurig and it is my favorite.  Recently I decided to try decaf and ordered this coffee.  I absolutely love it and it is still my favorite.
"Good, but kinda bland","I like that this is vegan but it really is rather bland. But no worries. I add some mushrooms, some chopped peppers, and my fave hot sauce and it is wonderfully delicious. There is much you can do with this as your base. Nothing is as comforting as a bowl of hot ramen soup. I have tried the miso one too and it is also pretty awesome."
Good potato chip alternative,"I had some of these Terra chips for the first time a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how good they were! I have since tried the Original, Mediterranean, and Sweets and Beets flavors. I liked them all, so I'm looking forward to trying even more of the flavors in the future. There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies. This makes them a great alternative to chips with more nutritional value. I really like them and enjoy having them for a snack now and then. I like the Mediterranean flavor best out of the ones I've tried so far, but they are all really good."
tiny boxes,"BEWARE! These are the very small boxes that sell for $2 elsewhere, even on Amazon. Do not pay more than $4 for two."
Great Mommy Afternoon Pick me Up!,"I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360. I have never tried this product before but had seen commercials of the product on tv.  I am a busy mother of 4 daughters (ages 6, 5, 3, and 2).  I have a very full schedule and as most moms know the afternoon hours are just when I start dragging.  Maybe a nap is what I need, but no time (literally!).  So I tried a small bit of 5 hour (half a bottle) just to see how it would go when I hit that afternoon drag-- and yep it was just what I needed to complete my day.  My mood is good, my energy is still on the go, and I am not dragging just struggling to make it through dinner and bathtime and the wonderful thing is no headaches.  This is a huge help to me and I am so thankful to 5 hour for this aid to my day- and yes it has made it on my grocery list!  I hope others find it as helpful as I have!"
"Okay, for a not very strong coffee","I like my coffee kind of medium, not too strong, not too weak, and these pods made fairly weak coffee.  I compare them to my own home made pods (using the ""Ecopad""  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007INM5A/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details) which I use in my Senseo, and I was fairly disappointed.  It was easy to see that the Marley Coffee Pods made much weaker coffee (lighter color, almost watery appearance).  I think I will stick with my Ecopad coffee pods.<br /><br />Incidentally, I want to put in a good word here for the Senseo coffee maker.  It is great for making a single cup of coffee (or maybe even a few cups of coffee but not at the same time).  The Ecopad pods are just as economical as regular coffee (you just spoon ground coffee into the Ecopad and make coffee as usual)."
I have my sanity back!,"These bottles have saved me from the insanity of constant sleepless nights with a colicky baby.<br />My older son never had this issue so I used Avent bottles with him, with my second we had a differnt story.<br /><br />These bottles helped with his colic within a day, he was spitting up much less, he slept soundly in between feeds. And of course, the angle reduced air intake so he wasnt as cranky.<br /><br />I was glad these dont have many parts, like most anti colic bottles, the nipple is a size which most babies can easily adapt to, and the comfy grip gives a good hold.<br /><br />Plus these arent as expensive as most bottles on the market.<br /><br />The only downside is that they arent wide at the neck, so getting formula in takes patience, but otherwise no issues!"
Nice spice,"I couldn't find this spice in regular stores, so it was nice to find it online.  The package provided more than I can use.  I should have ordered a smaller size."
Earth's Best Rocks!!!,Great quality at a good price and pure yumminess!!! I ate them! It felt like eating a jar of healthy goodness.<br />Thanks!
Beware this product has carrageenan,"I gave this product one star because it contains carrageenan which research has shown to proliferate cancer in animals. I was very excited to try this since I do not drink regular milk and I wanted a nutrient rich substitute for cow's milk to give my 1 year old son.  My review is not based on taste. I've never tasted this product and it arrived faster than estimated. Although carrageenan is a derivative of seaweed which I always thought was good for me, something may change in its processing as an emulsifier to make it less advantageous for the body. Nonetheless, You can research it for yourselves and make your own choice."
Not as good as the Berry Kiwi,"I've tried several of these sodas, and my favorite flavor is Berry Kiwi.  This (Watermelon Strawberry) is my second-favorite.<br /><br />These are a good alternative to soda, if you are willing to pay the price.  I like the fizz and the fruity taste."
Awesome Graduation Present!,"I bought this product for my graduation present to myself.  It came right on time, and everything was packed very neatly.  The caviar is DELICIOUS!  It's my first time ever tasting it and I absolutely love it.  Everything is great with this product.  I will definitely order again for special occasions."
very soothing,this herb tea is very soothing and makes me feel like when I was a kid at Christmas time with all of the treats and candies my parents would put out on the coffee table
Great product,"Great product, enables you to use your own coffee in your single brew maker. And I can make up several at a time!!!"
zero stars,"poor quality/old product.  Upon grating, nutmeg powdered and crumbled.  Ordered in October to use during holidays, now too late to return given Amazon policy--a waste of money and effort."
WONDERFUL DISCOVERY!,"THIS PRODUCT WAS JUST WONDERFUL.  IT HAS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE FLAVORS EVER.  IT IS NOT OVERWHELMINGLY RHUBARB OR GINGER, BUT A DELIGHTFUL COMBINATION.  I TRIED IT AS AN EXPERIMENT, AND WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK FOR MORE. I HAVE ALSO SERVED IT TO GUESTS, AND THEY LOVED IT TOO!  TAKE A CHANCE ON IT!  I CAN GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED. I HAVE REORDERED ONCE, AND PLAN TO AGAIN SHORTLY.  THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR ME TO REORDER!"
Great Product Hard to Find Great Deal,My Chi has heart murmur and is starting failure this product has the extra vitamins nutrients he needs. It is also good for the other dogs to prevent issues.  It does not seem to have extra sodium which is a huge plus and they love the taste. A++++ Give it a try and dont wait till its to late to give them a little extra heart protection.
Great snack don't feel guilty giving,"My 3 1/2 year old son can't get enough of these and they have been a staple in our house for the last year.  I love that I have something on hand, that also transports easily, that he loves and I feel good giving him."
Excellent,I buy my tea here because when on special its cheaper than wal-mart and I drink lots of tea. Watch for the free shipping and specials you'll save a ton of money. The more you buy the more you save.
Zqueen,This is great tasting coffee and my family lives it. They are very picky about coffee and this seems to have the approval of everyone
It's not peanut butter but it's pretty good!,"I bought this for my sister because she has been wanting to try it for so long so I thought it would be the perfect Christmas present.  She loves it.  Says it tastes just like peanut butter (and that was coming from when she just ate it off a spoon and only mixed with water).  I like it also, but I still think all natural peanut butter tastes better, but this is great for smoothies because the ""peanut butter"" doesn't stick to the blades making a very messy clean up and it gives the perfect amount of peanut taste.  I will definitely repurchase after using it all up."
Not bad,Got this to sprinkle on almonds and walnuts as an alternative to purchasing more expensive flavored nuts. It's okay; a little sharp. I may try soaking the nuts in water and then sprinkling with this so the flavor is more infused.
LOVE THESE!!,"I purchased these after watching a youtube video of a woman using them to make spaghetti with ground turkey. WHen they arrived, I already anticipated the smell upon opening the package and the texture possible being ""weird"". Must say, I have already eaten all six packages in different ways but my favorite dish was the spaghetti.  When I opened the small bag, The smell was fishy but I allowed them to rinse while I chopped my veggies. The texture was very similar to noodles but more like an asian noodle (like the noodle used for pad woon sen or ramen noodles)They really soaked up the flavor of the sauces I used. I will be ordering my next shipment today! I am completely impressed and will probably use these for my spaghetti from now on!"
Delicious and Well Packaged,"Hey everyone, I rarely submit reviews but I felt the need to let everyone know that this is a great product.  It was priced well, packaged perfectly, and is awesome in a salad.  We used a bit of teriyaki and roasted sesame seeds mixed with it to throw in some sushi rolls...mmmm.  aloha"
far from the best,"I bought this in a store looking for a replacement for my usual brand, Palanquin, and I was pretty disappointed.  The bags don't have enough tea inside; you need to use at least two to make decent cup. The black tea had a bitter tang that the spice was unable to overcome.  I won't be buying this one again."
Great Coffee,I have ordered this several times and like the fairly rich taste without any bitterness. It is also very smooth and is one of the better K-cups that I have found so far.
Bulk Coffee,This coffee has a great flavor and aroma. It is as good as any we have bought in the stores or coffee shops.
Effective,"The bag is strong enough that I don't hesitate to use it to pick up my dog's poop. And, I'm glad to know that it is compostable.<br />good product; good cost."
"Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats, Salmon","Excellent little treats about the size of the tip of your little finger.  I even cut them in half for my Italian greyhound so I can give him ""more.""  He can ""count,"" but doesn't recognize quantity.  He's very sensitive to certain ingredients, especially corn, and Zuke's treats don't make him ill."
Picture is deceiving,The rock candy on stick is about half of amount that is shown in picture.  Am not very happy about this.
Tantalizing treats,"Wonderful and tasty little treats.  Fun to eat, and and to look at.  Nice and soft, and not too sweet.  Just the perfect blend of sweet and savory."
My dogs love it!,"You'd think by looking at her that our 8 lb overweight toy poodle would eat most anything, but she and our 4 lb boy toy are finicky eaters.  They love this food.  It's the only one that I've found willing to publish it's caloric content (361 cals./cup), so I now am able to regulate the amount of food fatty gets (224 Cals.) and make sure that our hyperactive little boy gets all that he needs (244 cals) each day.  Stores don't carry the 10 lb bag, and most of them in town don't even carry the 2.5 pounders.  This was a great deal, and the superseal bag keeps it fresh.  Oh yes, the tiny size pieces 9mmx10mmx4mm are perfect for their tiny mouths."
Something in this flavor . . .,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050OIU4O"">Fancy Feast Delights with Cheddar Grilled Turkey & Cheddar Cheese Feast in Gravy Canned Cat Food 24 3-oz canned</a> Have not purchased a case of this yet, because I am still trying to determine which foods Cotton likes.  That means I am still at the stage of buying two cans of something new to see how he reacts, before I invest in a case.  He wants to like this one, but seems to be turned off by the wheat gluten, and possibly the modified corn starch, within.  He was already turned off by the wheat guten in a variety pack I did purchase (B0010B6IFY)  Fancy Feast has been notified."
Excellent,the tea is very good with honey and I have seen a difference. I have lost 3lbs since taking it.
Observe Pet Reactions to Greenies,"I had good results with this product six months ago.  However, a second purchase that I just opened caused all of my three dogs to vomit within minutes of eating the product.  I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly. I contacted the company about it and they have claimed no other problems exist(suggesting I must have tainted the product or have exposed it to an environment making the dog snacks unstable, or the company I purchased them from somehow did something to the product. Hmm: sounds troubling to me, especially from the factory.). I have seen other issues out there regarding this product, which vary.  Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an ""authorized vendor"".  ""Monster Pets"" is not authorized to resell these items and only those vendors listed on their website are ""authorized"".  They will only help you return/refund something if it was purchased through an ""authorized"" vendor.  This now makes me leery of items purchased through ""Amazon Marketplace"", particularly food items.  Buyer beware!  Caveat emptor!"
"Not Really ""Jerky""","It's difficult to tell from the pictures and the description, but these aren't really jerky (dried strips of meat) but are smallish, moist, chewy treats made from meat and other ingredients - I suppose meat goop formed into a shape.  Think Pringle vs. a potato chip.  Anyway, our dog seems to approve - not sure it even touched the sides!  The beef, lamb and salmon varieties she tried all disappear in the blink of an eye.  A tasty treat for your dog, made in the USA, but just not the jerky I was hoping for."
Awesome RF beans,"I was buying these at Whole foods for way too much and my kids love them so much they eat them out of the can so I decided to buy them by the case and we order a case about every 2 months.  They taste great, are organic and have reduced sodium.  Absoultely love them for beans and rice or quesadillas.  They are a staple in our vegetarian household."
Strange flavor --- I didn't like it,"I normally import my Weetabix all the way from England (being from England myself, Weetabix was always a firm favorite of mine for breakfast), so was delighted when I saw Amazon were selling it at a much better price.<br /><br />I had hoped that Weetabix is Weetabix, and taste wouldn't differ too much even if the product was made by a different company.  This product is made by some company in America, and it did taste different to the brand I typically buy from England.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't like it.  It had a strange flavor that just didn't appeal to me.  I'm sure it's a preference thing though, and there will be plenty of people who like this just as much (or maybe even better than) the British alternative.  I, however, will be going back to importing my Weetabix from England."
Causes GAS,I found the taste O.K. but they cause an unbelieveable amount of gas.  I prefer peanut butter Fiber One bars.
The Best Curry Around!,Patak's makes the best curry around. I frequently use it in my Yellow Chicken Curry Dish which is a favorite with both my husband and seven year old.
Are you sure this is Decaf?,Best flavor of all the decaf's on here.  My hat is off to Green Mountain.
Yummy Deliciousness!!,"By far, these are the MOST delicious brownies I've ever eaten!!  If you want to treat yourself or thank your friends, order these now.  They are so moist and rich with flavor.  We've had the double dark and the peanut butter - love them both.  They are all laced with caramel and dusted with powered sugar, which just give them that extra something special we've never experienced in another brownie. Anyone we've ever sent them to raves about them constantly."
Great Mix,We bought the Waring Belgium Waffle maker with the Golden Malted Mix.  The mix is fantastic.  We have re-ordered more.  That's as good as it gets.
An Aquired Taste,"This is a decent product, but I have a lot of texture issues.  The flavor is light and buttery, but not as sweet as I expected.  The sweetness was almost imperceptible.<br /><br />The previous reviews concerning manna were true in that the product does separate.  Re-mixing for was not a problem.<br /><br />The texture issues are that when eating it raw the initially it is smooth and creamy, but soon becomes thick and grainy.  The graininess makes it difficult for me to eat it off a spoon.<br /><br />I have tried mixing it in vegetables and curries and you can still get hints of the graininess.  The product also will solidify after it cools despite using it in cooked a dish."
IStevia Extract vs Nu Stevia,The last batch of 1000 was Nu Stevia. This one is Stevia Extract which is not as sweet from one pack. I now have to use 1 1/2 packs per mug of coffee.<br />Nana O
I HAVE TO REMEMBER I DIDNT BUY THEM FOR ME !!!,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXC3Q"">Kinnikinnick Foods Gluten-Free Cookies, Montana's Chocolate Chip, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>  = These cookies are so good, that I have to keep reminding myself that I bought them for my son who is GF/CF, and for me to stop eating them!!!!  Great prices here too."
Sugar Canisters,Was not happy with the wear and tear condition the canisters arrived. Serval of the canisters were disfigured and one had actually open and spilled inside of the shipment box.
Best Waffle Mix around!,This makes the best waffles ever!  Very easy to make!  Will be buying more soon.
taste great,Same great taste as jelly bellies for less money! The funny mis-shapes don't affect the quality or flavor of the candy.
Check the label,"The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are ""All Natural"" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain ""yeast extract."" On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with ""NO MSG,"" but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer."
The Best Candy on Earth,"This candy is amazing!  I've always bought it from the pseudo candy shops in the mall, which charge nearly $10 for one pound!  Amazon hooks us up with this delicious treat for a fraction of the cost!  I will be buying this candy on a regular basis just for my own personal enjoyment.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, thank you!"
Great,"My dogs just love the food and they look great! Their coats are shiny, no more scratching or itching. I also love the free shipping and price! Don't be afraid to give this a try, your dogs will thank you!!"
mimi,these were not fresh and very hard to chew without much flavor. Would never buy again.
Navitas nuturals Goji berries,"Good produces, Good service. Goji berries is very good for antioxident and healty. keep your skin smooth and look younger"
Tea,"I liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea.  I use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge.  Very good COLD and needs NO sweetening as is lightly sweet already.  Doesn't look pretty, but DOES look like a healthy drink!  I liked it!"
Save your $$ and Buy a Better Quality Tea,Save your money and buy a better quality tea than Lipton Loose Tea.  Tea is better than the bagged version but you will want to pour it through a fine filter before drinking because the leaves are broken and some are just very small particles.
Coconut Oil makes everyything taste fabulous,"Whether using it to pop pop corn or to cook eggs, this product is the secret ingredient to a delicious delight.  I discovered it at a trade show and have never stopped using it.  Besides the amazing taste, it is good for you.  My kitchen is never without coconut oil and this brand is one I trust for quality and taste."
I use this tea for menstral cramps,"I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot."
Reeses Peanut Butter Cups,"I ordered these for my nephew's birthday.  He has loved them since he was a kid.  They arrived in a timely fashion for his birthday, however, given the summer heat, they were a little melted (no ice pack enclosed).  But he put in the fridge and said he enjoyed them.  Would recommend product and timeliness of Seller."
Bought it for kids and wife,They said the salt and vinegar were horrible! Blecht! Couldn't get the awful taste out of their mouth. Now i'm stuck with this box of popchips! lol.
Great Treats!!!,My Cavalier Spaniel learned to sit within minutes. She is only 11 weeks old and will do anything for these treats!
THE ONLY TEA I DRINK!,"Like others, I too have a big issue with caffeine.  And, most decaf teas are dull. Even the other Chai Teas (in other brands) didn't taste as good as Stash's Chai Tea decaf does.  So, this is the only tea that I drink!  It starts me off every morning.  I add 3 packets of the Natra Taste sweetener and some milk and it's just delicious!<br /><br />I love the flavor.  I do not find it heavy in clove, or cinnamon or anything.  I find this a very nicley well-balanced, flavored tea.  Of all the Chai Teas on the market (reg. or decaf) I love Stash's blend the best of all.<br /><br />I was buying it regularly at my Safeway grocery, and then for some reason, it just wasn't around anymore. In fact, there wasn't any decaf tea at all in the store.  Geez!  So, then I went over to the Giant (a longer drive), and was buying it there.  Suddenly, it's not there anymore either. Geez!<br /><br />Thank God I found it on-line.  So, these people have me now as a loyal customer and I hope this is going to be available for a long, long time."
Love it!!,was very surprised by how great it tastes.  thought that maybe it would be watery tasting but its not :)
"The BEST Gluten free, egg free, soy free, dairy free mix!!!","I've tried all the various gluten free mixes out there that don't have soy in them (we avoid soy) and as we also avoid egg and dairy I have to use substitutes for those in any mixes or baking I do. This mix has none of those allergens already in it and doesn't require any of those be added either! Of all the mixes I've tried these have THE BEST flavor, texture and over all quality. If you melt/heat your butter/oil it will melt the chips when you mix it together and you can then have chocolate cookies - I do this a lot and add shredded coconut and almond essence, which is super yummy!<br /><br />This mix is great - I can't recommend it highly enough!!!!"
This is gluten free.,"I am not sure what the other reviewer is referring to but the Organic Gluten Free Tamari travel packs are gluten free. I almost didn't order this because of the reviewer. I rushed to my pantry and pulled out the bottle of Tamari that I have to cook with and could find nothing that the reviewer referred to as having wheat in it. I have a gluten allergy. I am bummed when I go out for sushi & the establishment does not carry Tamari (wheat free soy sauce) so I usually fill a little container from home when I go out for sushi (often). When I saw the travel packs I was thrilled and ordered it. On the packaging, it states that it is certified gluten free. The ingredients are: Water, Organic Soybeans, Salt, Organic Alcohol. I give this 5 solid stars."
Nice flavorful and full-bodied.,A very nice flavor with no after-taste. It gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste. You have to have another cup!
"Mmmmmm, love it.","This tea is delicious.  I absolutely love it.  It comes in an ugly brown box, not what is seen in the photo.  So you would not want to gift it in the box but that doesn't change the flavor.  Yummmm!"
Good,"I bought this because I heard about the benefits of Sage tea. I got used to the taste pretty quickly and love to pour it in a glass of ice to enjoy during the summer days.<br /><br />I took a star off because I've been drinking it for several weeks and I'm not seeing the work of benefits that is claimed of Sage tea (but then, I've always believed that you lose some benefits when the teas are in bags as opposed to still being in leaf form?)."
Heady Aroma and Delicious Peach Flavor,"Before you even take a sip of this tea the peach aroma entices you. Unlike most green teas this tea is not overly bitter. This contains green tea, ginger root, peach flavor and Japanese Matcha. It is perfect to perk you up in the dead of winter. I like flavoring this tea with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VDB78M"">Madhava Agave Nectar 100% Pure Organic Sweetener</a>. Enjoy.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
Unhappy Customer....false advertising,"I saw that the price advertised for the ""Subscribe and Save"" was $6.79($0.35/oz).  Since that was a good deal I ordered it.  After I placed the order I did the math on my own and realized that it is actually $.43 per oz.  If I would have done the math before, I would not have placed the order.  I am very disappointed that the would lie about the price."
Lindt Product,This is a great way to purchase Lindt Chocolate Bars because you save money buying in bulk. I received the exact same product which is in the retail stores. Love using Amazon for bulk purchases!
Hearty,The cookie is true to it description.  Has a good taste with a equal distribution of ingredients.  I find them satisfying.
Excellent Cake Mix,"I add diced apples to this mix to make a Dutch Style apple cake.  It is excellent!  Kids and husband love it!  I usually add more cinnamon too.<br />The Cravings Place makes the best cake mixes in my opinion, and the Chocolate Chip cookie mix is incredible too!!"
Easy to roll out and tastes Yummy!,"I only gave this 3 stars because I used this fondant for my daughters birthday cake and though it's very easy to roll out it was almost tooo pliable. I made a decorative bow for the top and wouldn't hold up in the heat. Kept falling down and loosing it's shape. It's great though for making flat shapes to stick on a cake, cupcakes, etc."
"Bold, rich and delicious","I've tried many others and for the price this coffee can't be beat! If you're looking for an even bolder coffee, try the Eight O'clock Italian roast."
Great ginger flavor but with a chalky texture.,"I first tried these Newman Ginger Mints from a local grocery store. They were packaged in an Altoid-like tin and were the same size, shape and texture as Altoids.<br /><br />I wanted to find a cheaper place to purchase, so I came to Amazon and found these. I assumed they would be the same - just in a roll.<br /><br />They are not the same! The flavor is spot on, but the texture is very chalky and they are as big as life-savers.<br /><br />I would purchase again, but I think I will try to do some more research and find the ones in the tin."
Quite tasty and crunchy health snack,"If you never have tried Kind healthy grains products the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds would be a good one to try. The Kind line is all natural with nothing artificial. This is basically an all-natural granola, that you can eat right out of the bag, with yogurt or as a cereal with milk. This particular selection includes five whole grains, so your getting lots of fiber. Just beware that a single serving size is only 1/3 cup, so this is not a low-calorie food if you eat a lot of it. For those on low-sodium diets, this is for you, as one serving only has 20 mg of sodium. The blueberry taste comes through nicely, and my only reservation is for my personal taste the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters is a tad too sweet for my taste. I wish they would use less sweeteners, for we, after all, can always add more sugar if we want to make it sweeter. That's the reason I give the product 4 rather than 5 stars."
NOM NOM NOM!,"Oh boy, do I love eggnogg!  Unfortunately, I am diabetic.  This sugar-free syrup is THE BOMB!  The only bad thing, is that it is heavy to ship.  Maybe I'll buy a case next time there is free shipping!  Voila!  No more bad!"
What happened to my old Caribou Blend??,"LOVED Caribou Blend.  Found a great price at Amazon, ordered enough to last 5 or 6 months.  K-Cups had a different logo than my previous purchases, and tasted sooooo bad I couldn't drink it.  After opening several boxes and brewing several cups from each box, each cup as bad as the last, I decided to return the unopened boxes.  BUYER BEWARE--I had no idea that the seller would refuse to take back or refund anything on ""consumable"" products.  I'm out a lot of money for really bad coffee and can't find another brand that is as good as my old Caribou Blend.  Any suggestions??"
Nutritious treat,"All 3 of my dogs really enjoy these sweet potato chews. It doesn't take them very long to chew them up, though.  Still a better alternative to rawhides, and certainly better for them.  There are different sizes in each bag, from about 2"" x 1"" to 1/2"" x 1/2"".  There are about 9 to 12 pieces in each bag.  Some pieces can be broken in half, to accommodate smaller dogs. I do recommend these treats."
excellent tea,"I love this tea. I suffer from fatigue, mild depresssion and fairly severe social anxiety. I have found that this tea gives me a little pep without being overly stimulating. It helps with motivation. It brightens my mood significantly. It also takes the edge off in social situations to some degree for me. It has a pleasant taste and aroma. It seems to help settle a slightly queasy stomach also. Once it helped a pretty persistent (but not  severe) headache quite nicely as well. I am very pleased with this product. For me it is the best tea I've found thus far."
"nice flavor, good price","This is a pleasant-flavored tea, and buying it in bulk results in a considerable savings over the price of smaller packages."
Great product,"I bought these to take to my son's daycare for his birthday as an alternative to cookies or cupcakes. Some of the children in his class are allergic to glutens, eggs, etc. and I didn't want to bring something everyone couldn't have.  These lollipops were perfect...The flavors are fantastic and the kids loved them!!"
sesame blues chips,"My husband really likes seaseme chips so I ordered 12 packages, however I only got a 11 packages and all were crushed. This was a very bad job packing box and shipping. I won't order again."
DOOMHAMMER approved,"I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. He suffered from some stomach problems when he was a puppy so I switched him to Innova. I loved Innova, but my puppy didn't - his hair became oily, he didn't seem interested in the food, he began to smell bad, and the stomach issues continued. I did more research, switched to Wellness, and everything cleared up! I like the clean ingredients, the way his coat looks, and how he NEVER has bad breath or puppy farts. Ever."
Old and stale,I just received mine and it all broke into pieces. These are clearly old and all them are in horrid condition. I'm returning this. It's not edible.
The price to pay for a good product,"I moved from California to San Antonio, several years ago and unfortunately the closest place I can get my ponzu sauce is in Houston, so I tried this method, yes, Expensive, but cheaper than making the 200 + miles tour."
Dingo Bones are the best!,"Our Corgi loves all sizes, shapes, and flavors of Dingo Bone treats!  The other reviewer commented on the VENDOR; we've never got a bad Dingo yet!  Highly recommended!"
As expected!,I know from experience what I was ordering and was not disappointed in any way.  Shipped fast and arrived intact.
Herbal Tea,"The box arrived damaged and open, but the tea boxes were still sealed.  The red bush tea is delicious, as usual."
A coffee-like break!,"I have tried herbal coffee before, and never could see the appeal, but I decided to try once again, and happened to pick up Maya Caffe.  What a pleasant surprise!  It has the richness of coffee, and a energy kick, without caffiene.  I was much surprised and pleased.<br /><br />It may not replace Starbucks, but if you want to kick caffiene, or even just looking for a warm rich beverage that's suitable for evening, I'd recommend this product highly!"
Depending on your dog they may last forever or for a few minutes,"I have a yellow lab that destroyed the kitchen furniture when he was teething, but he is 3 years old now, and he prefers shoes. He doesn't chew on furniture anymore, but good size rawhide bones only last an hour on his paws, which is longer than these treats but not so healthy for him. He found that instead of trying to chew these hard treats out of the rubber ball, he can get them out rather easily by dropping the ball to the kitchen floor, over and over again, until they come out. Once the treats are loose (5-10 minutes later) they break easily in his powerful jaws. Note: The treats don't come out so easily when he drops the ball on the carpet, but he knows that.<br />The treats keep him entertained for half an hour, maybe longer using one treat on each side of the ball. Not perfect, but I haven't found anything better. I would have given it 5 stars if the ball had a tighter grip to hold the treats for a little longer. My dog loves the taste, and seem healthier than rawhide, but I haven't really found anything edible he doesn't like."
Picture makes it look better than it is,"I like mini-wheats in general for the fibre content. So I was looking for a nice flavored variety and decided to try this out.<br />The taste is where I had a problem with this. It's sweet enough, but the cinnamon seems to leave a bit of an after taste. That's the main reason I'm rating this lower.<br />Otherwise, it's pretty good. The size of the bites is nice - I like that it's smaller. You can control better how much you want to serve.<br />Maybe I'm being a little too picky with the taste. So I would recommend trying it out to see for yourself."
Big enough!,Finally a drawer unit that will hold 3 boxes of K-cups. It has no slip grips on the bottom and can be stacked for more coffee storage. Attractive design. No unsightly half full boxes on your countertop. Thank you.
Pantry Staple,"This is a great product.  I have not had a single baking disaster using this flour blend.  Rachel Carlyle's the real deal.  It is obvious that developing this blend (& her coconut blend) was a labor of love.  Her cookbooks are a must have. Cinnamon Swirl Coffee Cake, yum.  Mochaccino Delights are the best cookies I have ever made.  And they are easy to make, the recipe makes about 48-56 cookies (and they freeze great).  Her blog/newsletter has great recipes also.[..]  I have great admiration for Rachel's commitment to gluten free baking.  She will convert a recipe to gluten free if you send her the recipe.<br />This is the only flour blend that I have used that results in baked goods that do not dry out in one day.  It is worth every penny.  Thank you Rachel!"
"A great invention, why didn't they invent it sooner?!?","I wish they had invented these ten years ago when my late cat, Jack, needed heart medication three times a day.  It would have saved me and the cat much grief getting his pills down.<br /><br />Jill (my current 19 year old) needs thyroid and pregnesone twice a day.  With the pill pockets, I put them into the pocket, and drop them into her wet food.  She eats the pockets like they're just part of her food, medication and all.  Finally, a product that makes giving medicine a treat instead of something to dread!"
Does not taste at all like I thought I would :),I really had high expectations of this product but the artificial flavoring just kills it.<br />My wife gets migraines and the artificial flavoring in this product has been reported to make these worse.<br />I just wish I hadn't gotten a double pack.
My cats love them,These are one of my two cats favorite treats. As soon as they hear the bag crinkle they come running!
Please offer this year-round through Subscribe & Save!,"This tea is delicious either hot or cold. Its aroma is so rich and soothing that it would be worth brewing even if you didn't drink it.<br /><br />So many of us want this year-round that I wish Amazon would make it available through Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />If only Celestial Seasonings would ALSO make a decaff version of this tea, I could enjoy it in the evening as well. (I'm super-sensitive to caffeine). But at least this ""regular"" version is a great start to my day.<br /><br />Since I sometimes have trouble finding Nutcracker Sweet at a reasonable price, I occasionally ""stretch"" it by brewing it thus: 1 bag of Nutcracker Sweet + 1 bag of PG Tips + 3 cups of boiling water. The two teas complement each other very nicely.<br /><br />When it's iced, sweetened with Xylitol (which dissolves best while the tea is still warm), and laced with a bit of milk or Half & Half, it satisfies me more than most desserts. I even know some people who add a drop of Irish Cream...."
pretty tasty,As instant meals go this one is surprisingly flavorful and has a nice whole grain taste to it. Many such entrees seem just like empty carbs but this actually tastes pretty good and seems somewhat healthy. When I need a quick snack at home before running errands I'll add some frozen peas to it and it'll keep me satisfied and from buying a bunch of impulse items at the grocery store.
"Nut, Nut","Product arrived promptly and in great condition.  Product was very fresh and delicious.  Seems difficult to find spanish peanuts, much less good spanish peanuts.<br />Outstanding product at a good price.  I will reorder."
Perfect for training,"My husband and I are vegetarians and we were looking for a treat we could use for our puppy's training sessions that wouldn't gross us out. We typically make our own peanut butter dog treats for our dogs, but they're too big and too crunchy to work for training. These moist mini peanut butter flavor treats are perfect! They don't gross us out and both our dogs (the puppy and our 2 year old dog) LOVE them and are highly motivated during training sessions."
Great Product - Too Expensive!,"I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.  Do your research as there are some foods that should not be fed to your dogs includeing cooked bones which can cause havoc for them."
Try it at least once,"It's definitely an item for tourists. If you don't know how to open one, don't throw away the cap and look up some how-tos from youtube.<br /><br />The flavor is hard to describe. It's VERY sweet. If you've smelled melon-scented lotions or perfumes, this would be its flavor. Whenever I see someone selling this, melon (and strawberry) is usually one of the first to sell out, so grab one if you see one. If you're unsure if you'll like it, try the original flavor (sweet like a bubble gum flavor) first."
Okay......if you're a dog,"I have my Min-Pin boarded at the home of a friend who has what looks like a Westie. I took the bottle of ""Lickety Stik"" over when I went to pick up my dog. Offered it to both dogs. The westie loved it, however my Min-Pin would have nothing to do with it. Maybe that's because another dog licked it, however that's doubtful as most dog I've met aren't that fussy. Its kind of a cool idea but I think a dog biscuit works just as well. One other caveat, it looks like the same bottle that roll-on deodorant comes in so make sure you know for sure what you're smearing on your arm-pits or you could attract some unwanted attention"
picky daughter loves them!,I got these as my daughter is gluten free. She is a very picky eater. She loves these! She can eat a bag in one sitting. My husband who is on a low fat diet loves them as well. I find them just a little bland.
"If you want to mainline salt, these will do the job","I love crunchy cheese goodies. I thought these White Cheddar Just the Cheese snacks would be a nice little treat but when I tried them, I thought I had bitten into a salt lick. I have never eaten cheese that was even half as salty as these little bits. They were toasty and crunchy but the salt overwhelms everything. I won't be reordering."
Timothys decafe columbian k cup,The taste is great.  I like it very much and would purchase it again
Too delicios!,If there's a problem with these fruit sticks...it's that they are too delicious! Our 2.5 year old loves his fruit sticks! They do have 15g or so of sugar.
"If I'm going to be executed, I want these for dessert at my last meal","The pecan pie bars are delicious. In texture and taste they are exactly like classic pecan pie filling. These things are so good I wrote the company fan mail. Hopefully they will not respond with a restraining order, I was pretty effusive. If you like pecan pie you should be pretty impressed by these bars."
Spicy World Saffron,"Great packaging, very well sealed. Store in a dark place. I use this as an ingredient in my homemade seasoning that I use to sprinkle on foods before consumption and sometimes in the food itself. I like the quality, price and packaging."
be careful!,"I purchased this product for my husband who loves very bold coffee.  Each time we have made the coffee in our Keurig it explodes all over.  (Clearly after the third try I have now thrown the rest away) We were lucky to always be away from the coffee maker, but if you were standing there it would have burned you.  All the other types off coffee that we have used and continue to use work perfectly, so I know that the Emeril coffee was the problem.  If you have kids keep them away from the coffee maker."
best faux jerky,This brand is the best of all the faux jerkies. Even meat eaters enjoy it. This is my second favorite flavor. Hickory Smoked is my favorite flavor.
Delicious!,"These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!"
Yum!!!,"I love grape tootsie pops and while the price for these is probably [more than buying a variety bag in the store, at least, I am getting what I want and nothing I won't use."
Best Snack Ever!,"We were given a bag of these from some college kids who were thankful we delivered something for them as they did not have a truck.  They sat on the counter for a while before I tried them and then - they were addictive!  There are 24 smaller bags inside with maybe a Tablespoon or two full of hot peas inside each.  They are spicy but not unbearably hot like Wasabi Peas.<br /><br />The only reason this got 4 Stars instead of 5 is because of the price.  Currently, $5.35 per bag is being charged plus shipping.  I purchase them at our local Asian grocery store and they are $2.59.  That is a pretty big price difference.  So, if you have an Asian grocery near you, try them first - if not, go ahead and purchase them here because you will love them!"
"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
Healthy treats for the kids,My kids love these freeze dry fruits.  Great as a take  along snacks when we are on the go.  A little expensive for the amount of fruits you get. Will stock up the next time Amazon has these on sale (lighting deal).
Excellent choice - even for the finicky!,"I decided it was time to start feeding my senior cat a wet food diet. She has a tendency to turn her nose up at most of the ""healthy"" choices, but she absolutely devoured this one. Several months later, she is still loving it and practically licks the bowl clean!  It has made a world of difference in her energy level, her coat is shiny and it has cut down on the amount of waste in the litter box.  The ingredients are all natural and my vet recommended this as one of the top choices of wet food for my cat.<br /><br />The food is in smaller size chunks with a LOT of gravy.  The pouch is easy to rip open, or can be cut. I highly recommend it as a healthy choice and for your finicky feline :)"
Fig Newton's are not for Losers,"I demand you to eat more of this product ... Soon, this item will be mandated by your government to be consumed by all ...  cause it's sooooo damn good!!!"
Yummy for a big tummy~,These are delicious but quite high in the calorie department~  It'a hard to stop eating the whole bag once you get started~
"Green Mountain kcup Black Magic, Black Diamond Extra Bold, Nantucket Blend","I have tried many of the available coffee's available but, I enjoy a robust coffee in the morning and both Black Magic and Black Diamond Extra Bold meet and exceed what I was expecting.  The Nantucket Blend is a great coffee for anytime of day or night.  I usually wait until Amazon has a sale on these to make my purchase...Make sure when you buy k cups that the Amazon Prime logo appears...Without the Amazon Prime Logo, I have found what I received in the past did not reflect what I had ordered.. Substitution get made without your knowledge and sometimes count is short, etc..."
1/2 as good as regular strength name brand,"This Extra Strength product is much cheaper than even Regular Strength 5 Hour Power brand, but in my opinion tastes a lot more bitter and has a lot less caffeine. I gave it a try and went back to Regular Strength 5 Hour Power brand, because I didn't feel anything when I drank these.  The name brand costs more, but tastes better and has more caffeine."
One of the best KIND varieties,"Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I've tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal."
awesome juice,"This juice is very good for a lot of different reasons.  It is used for many things pertaining to good health. I use it for energy and arthritis pain, in which it does help."
Cats won't touch them,I have 2 cats and neither would eat them without a pill in them. They are spoiled by the brand Temptations and don't like anything else for a treat. They only eat 9 lives dry and canned so i guess they are picky. I have bought every brand cheap and expensive and guess i'll give up.
Adventurist coffee frdinker,The sampler is great for those who want to experience different coffee flavors without purchasing large quantities.  This package has enough choices to provide coffee drinkers the ability to choose favorites.
Not a good change,"I used to have an Amazon subscription for Zico when it came in the cartons and wasn't made from concentrate. When Zico made the change, I decided to try one of their new bottles from a local store before starting a new subscription. I'm glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I've ever had. It's not the worst, but it's down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won't be getting Zico anymore.<br /><br />I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8SO10"">Naked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. It's as good as the old Zico was if not better."
ripe off,i thought i was getting a deal UNTIL I SAW THAT I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A BOX for $ $ 4.98 at Walmart when they were in season...I was charged almost $10.00 per box...wasnt too happy
Davidson's Caramel Peach with Coconut Tea,"I'm not a tea drinker.  In fact up until the last week I would have said that I hated tea, in all its forms, hot, cold, sweetened, iced, etc.  But I'm bound and determined to make myself like tea because it's good for you and better than the soda I continually chug for the caffeine source.  So when I found Davidson's tea at a local market I decided to give it a try because the flavors sounded interesting and I didn't really have anything to lose.  And I'm so glad I did.  While I'd still rather be drinking a pepsi, this tea has made me realize that I may be able to convert myself.<br /><br />This particular flavor, Caramel Peach with Coconut, is considered a dessert tea and I figured that was the best place to start.  Something sweet to replace the cloying taste of a soda.  And this actually was pretty sweet.  I decided not to add any sweetener to the cup of tea as I figured that might be a bad habit to get into, so I just steeped this tea in boiling water for about five minutes, removed the tea bag, and started drinking.  And I was actually ok with the flavor and enjoyed sipping on it.  The most noticeable taste was the caramel.  It's what I really could taste aside from the bitterness of the tea itself.  I didn't so much taste the coconut, and only got a fair hint of the peach, but that was ok.  The taste was smooth and while there was that faint aftertaste of bitter tea that I don't really enjoy, it wasn't as bad as in some other teas I've tried.<br /><br />The ingredients were also very good in this tea.  Most of it was organic and used barley, chicory, chamomile, carob and rooibos and some natural flavors.  I was very pleased with the blend and it made me feel pretty healthy drinking it.  And it's not often you can find an organic tea at the reasonable price this is offered at either.  It was caffeine free, but that's just as well considering I used it at night while reading a book and getting ready for bed.  It made it all the more relaxing.<br /><br />As a beginner tea drinker I'd say this is very good.  It's the second of the brand that I've tried and both have been very palatable to me.  I look forward to drinking more of this flavor and branching out and trying others.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"
Great training product for our dog,We cut the treats in half on band saw and use the chews as special treats. great trainning aid our dog loves them. good breath  control and used sparingly so dog respond quickly for this treat.
LOVE!!,I absolutely LOVE these candy bars...My Aunt from Australia used to bring them when she came to visit so I searched online to find some since she has not visited in awhile...Brings back memories.
spice heaven,"received this  bag of za,ater from this seller.  excellent product 16 oz package/very tasty and versatile.  EXCELLENT VENDOR"
Delicious,"It is delicious. Mild means not spicy at all. Goes well with ground pork, chicken, or beef. Optionally you may choose to not add any meat for a tasty vegetarian dish. Use fresh, medium tofu. Not too silky or it falls apart. Not too old or coarse or it will crumble and also ruin the dish."
Tasty! Tasty!,"These chips are great-they're crispy, crunchy, and have lots of flavor. Many times, gluten-free is taste-free, but not this time. We served to guests one night and several wanted to know what brand, etc.  You will not be disappointed.  They came well packed--nothing was crushed or broken."
Yea! We found a coffee...,"We try all kinds of different coffees, and are so happy with all the flavors we've tried from this company. The chocolate velvet is my favorite so far. The shipping and flavors have been great up to this point!"
Lose Weight with Corn Pasta,"We do not have the enzyme to digest corn.  Using corn pasta, instead of any other pasta, helps me lose weight.  At first the taste seems a little weird, after having eaten regular flour pasta for your whole life, but add some spagetti sauce, or cheese, etc. and it does taste just like regular pasta.  Just make sure you rinse it well after cooking, as you should any pasta, but rinsing this helps make it taste more like regular pasta.  Also try corn tortillas, and corn pita, and other corn pasta's like elbow macaroni, fetticini etc. I have lost over 40 pounds, and it is great for diabetics who have to watch their carb intake.  This doesn't make you blood sugar jump up.  I would have given it 5 stars, but like I said the taste takes some time getting use to, but it is not bad. Also, when cooking it leaves a little frothy paste like film on the outside that must be washed offed. Otherwise I give it a 5. Try using corn torilla's instead of bread and you will loose more weight, and keep you blood sugar more even.  Plus being gluten free has it's many advantages too."
Worth it! But there are better deals.,"The price is right. Quality is acceptable and the chews are thicker than most. Definately a good buy. It's nice to have them individually bagged.  I say that compared to store prices.  On amazon, Green Cow brand sells a 5 pound bag for half the price and it qualifies for prime."
Not so BOLD anymore,I used to love the Bold Party Blend when it was the same mix pictured on the old packaging they have on Amazon.<br /><br />Now they've reduced the flavor (it has to have at least half the intensity it used to have) and removed the round crackers--which were fantastic with the Bold Party Blend seasoning.<br /><br />Why mess with a good thing?  I would have given the old version 5-stars.  It *was* that good.
So Salty!,"They should rename this product Salt Paste For Butter Chicken Curry.  The sodium content is really high and I'm surprised by all the high reviews because you can taste it.  I even tried to add milk to cut it down but it only help minimally.  I understand how some people might like this if they like very salty foods and after all, you are adding 4 Table Spoons of butter to a 3.5oz product, it could be mud and it would be tasty to some people!  But for me, someone who eats Indian food often and realize that it's the butter and cream that can make things taste great just can't find the appeal in this product.  With a serving containing 480mg of sodium (1920mg for the entire 3.5oz)this product should be avoided not just because it's unhealthy but because it's just not really good. I'm adding 1 star because it's shipment was very fast."
Fabulous!,"Our dogs love these things!  They carry them around like a bone.  We break them in half because we have smaller dogs, which means they last longer for us.  The variety is what I purchased, which mixes it up for them.  Animals like variety too!"
OakleysMom,"My Husband & I stayed at a Inn in Branson,Mo this summer & they served waffles at breakfast using this mix! They were delicious & I vowed to purchase a waffle iron of my own just so I could whip these up at home! We got a waffle iron before I ordered this mix though & bought Krusteaz waffle mix from our local Wal-mart in the mean time to test out the waffle maker. Krusteaz mix is easy (need eggs & oil) & doesnt require melted butter like Carbons Golden Malted & tastes awesome, much like what we had at the Inn in Branson! Yet I couldnt wait to get my Carbons Golden Malted waffle mix in the mail & had ordered 6 tins of it! Thats How much we loved it at the Inn where we 1st had it! Now I know how good it was which is why I am shocked to be writing this review... We made our 1st batch of waffles using this mix & was sort of put off that we had to add melted butter unlike the Krusteaz store bought which uses oil instead! Aside from that the waffles didnt come out full like all the others we had using the other mix & tasted VERY BLAND wasnt even a little bit malted flavored like we remembered. Had a almost bitter bland flavor, we thought maybe we did something wrong & made a whole new batch & yet again tasted awful! We did use water & not milk however thats what we used with the Krusteaz brand too & it was very good! I cant imagine milk making it have a better or sweeter flavor & am sure that the Inn where we stayed used water rather than go through the expense of using that much milk for a free breakfast for their guests!!! My husband even said next time we should try milk & add some vanilla extract to the mix, which perhaps will make it taste better however that is just to mask the awful bland flavor it has! I considered giving the rest of my tins to people for Christmas however wouldnt want to embarrass myself now knowing how bad it tastes! =( I hate that Im giving the mix a bad review because like I said it was wonderful when we 1st tried it in Branson, maybe some how we received a BAD batch or something either way we are sitting on 5 1/2 tins of UNWANTED mix!!! We Really want to send it back, but waited to long!!! Hope this helps you all as for us we will be buying th yummy Krusteaz mix from our local grocery from now on & I only gave it 2 stars because I know how good it supposed to be!"
Best wake up coffee every,I'm very picky when it comes to my coffee.  I like mine strong with a good flavor.  This has become my only coffee and I've tried plenty.
Looking for the same as Wendy's,"If you are looking for the same dressing as Wendy has look for Marzetti Simply dressed & light Raspberry Acai.  It is just as difficult to find, but the ingredients are the same as Wendy's dressing, except they had a little lemon juice.  It tastes the same and is yummy.  They only place I have found it is Mybrands.  Their shipping prices are outragious, but the bottles are pretty reasonable.  Still haven't found it in the store.  Enjoy!"
"good, at one time",We subscribed to this product for awhile and it was a good mushroom then recieved a batch that seem if all the rejects were put into one bottle and we got it. Will no longer purchase this brand.
Best BBQ Sauce I ever had!,"I am a very picky health concious guy who is an athlete, I try to pick organic foods, also I drink my daily green tea and matcha tea, all organic ofcourse, so when it comes to BBQ its easy to become unhealthy with the high fat and high sodium usually accompanied with preservatives, but there are healthy ways to BBQ and this sauce is a great supplement! It is the most healthy sauce and the flavor is phenomenal, one of my favorites bbq sauce of all time is ""Stubbs"" texas bbq sauce which is another all time great, but I would say BSS is slightly better, I give it A+++, and Stubbs original bbq sauce I rate A+."
My low guilt chocolate fix,"Sugar alcohols are absorbed by the body differently than regular sugars. They can also lead to gastric discomfort in some people. So I understand that just because these are sugar free doesn't mean I can binge on them. That said, I really like these bars, and appreciate the simple  sugar alternative. I have tried other favors of think thin but these are by far my favorite (the chocolate dipped nuts bar comes a close second). The other think thin bars have a fake sweet taste to them...these are not cloyingly sweet. I have a sweet tooth but I do not like foods that are too sweet, it you know what I mean. Don't expect the taste of real brownies ( the ones that have loads of sugar and fat), expect a protein bar and you might be happy.. I'm  hooked on to these."
I only use Earth's Best products!,I love Earth's Best products. That's the only product I use for my baby! My baby loves it and I never had any problem with it. It organic which makes it all that much better!
Terrific fruit snacks,"These are terrific fruit snacks. They are very tasty and healthy. They are certified organic and made with real fruit juice. Flavors included are strawberry, cherry, and raspberry. The texture is great - chewy and smooth."
"great sale, great coffee","If you are lucky enough to have a Senseo Coffeemaker you know how good the pods are and what great coffee they make.  This was an excellent price on the pods, and shipping was very fast."
good tea very pleased,"Very good tea.  Has a nice taste.  I am very pleased with the product.  It came when promised, which I appreciated very much.  I would buy it again from this seller"
Delicious!,Received as promised. This coffee is an unusual departure from the Keurig-oriented standards. A Flavor you can actually taste - the right combination of quality beans and proper roasting make this selection a winner in our house... I'll be looking for more of these...!
Tastes great!,"This soup is easy to make, tastes great and has a good consistency. My family cannot tell it is a gluten-free soup."
Not Strong enough,"The tea is Ok but if you like your tea strong or with a dash of milk, this is not the best!"
My Favorite Granola,"This wonderful organic granola has become my favorite granola. It is just perfectly crunchy and goes well with milk or can be sprinkled on top of yogurt. I like the crunchiness of the pumpkin seeds and they mix well with the oats and flax seeds. This is sweetened with evaporated cane juice instead of regular sugar or corn syrup. It is also high in fiber, low in sodium and has six grams of protein per serving. Give it a try I think you'll love it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
Amazing,I am amazed..I just bought a case to use as a preschool snack and I took one out to try and my three year old sucked one down in less then 30 seconds. I was shocked!  I am goito try the other flavors.  It has never been this easy to get a veggie in my little picky eater!!
soy goooood,This stuff is so good. I used this on some ground lamb patties with rice. Kids ate it all and asked for more. Very sweet.
Pat O Brien's,We went to New Orleans in Feb. and went to Pat O'Brien's to<br />have a Hurricane. We had never had one before and our whole<br />group thought they were soooooo good. We brought some of the<br />mix home and my neighbors loved them too. I went to Amazon<br />and there was the mix. I always order from Amazon as it is a<br />very trustworthy site. I ordered three more containers and am<br />sure I will be back.
Fixed My Dogs Hip,"I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past."
"If milk chocolate carmels are one of your things, you're in for a Treat!","I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this 'bag' but was certainly delighted! In fact, I was even leery<br />up until I opened the individually wrapped candy and found that they were each a perfect size for a two bite<br />treat that replicated the milk chocolate caramels that were added to the larger Godiva box of chocolates. Only<br />problem is controlling yourself not to eat them all at once!  A Super Treat!<br />Pica"
Good but expected better,"The coffee is good but not great. The package is supposed to be vacuum packed but this one was not. Seems like leaky vacuum bags are a problem at Lavazza. And I don't know if the coffee would have been better if the package had held the vacuum. In contrast, the Lavazza Dark Roast Arabica is a wonderful daily coffee."
"Truly authentic cheeses, great customer service, fast","Fast and easy communication. Great customer service, and most importantly - great authentic selection of cheeses. After tasting this one, I've immediately went on to try more and could hardly resist all the quality selection they've provided. Highly recommend!"
3 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."
contains Fo Ti,which is why I purchased it for a snack. But the dietary fiber or something disagreed with me. gas.. I still ate em all but.. not again.
Jolly Ranchers,"Best candy ever!  I'm a teacher and my kids love these! But they never include enough blue rasberries.  Thanks, Candy Mafia!"
Amazon came to the rescue of a church dinner...,"My wife Carlene and I have known about Wheat Nuts for many years, but we have not seen it on our grocer's shelves for a long time.  We cook for a church function, and Carlene wanted to make a cold salad that had chicken, fruit, mixed greens, and nuts.  We know that at least one person who would be attending has a nut allergy, and we had decided to leave out the nuts.<br /><br />Carlene thought of Wheat Nuts - a nut free food that tastes a lot like pecans.  But where to buy it?  When three special shopping trips failed to find any, well, what else was there to do but turn to Google.  Sure enough, there they were on Amazon.  The jar pictured looked like we remembered, and the price was certainly reasonable, so I placed an order for 6 jars.<br /><br />I am pleased to report that the shipment arrived in good time, and was well packed.  Best of all, the product was exactly what we remembered.  The taste went well with the rest of the ingredients.  I would recommend Wheat Nuts as a substitute for nuts in a recipe - and they are great eaten out of hand."
"When my grocer doesn't have it, I cry a little on the inside","This is my favorite Ritter bar - the dark chocolate is intense, but not too sweet nor bitter, and the marzipan reminds me of a slighly more sophisticated Mounds bar, but does not caught in your teeth like coconut.  This flavor combination is the ultimate craving buster.  It's harder to find than the other Ritter bars, but I've finally identified a couple of nearby stores that are always stocked.  Divine."
Full of flavor,Cheeze-It the creamy and mild Mozzarella baked snack crackers are wonderful and full of amazing flavor.  Very nice snack and is full of flavor that is so very satisfying. I would highly recommend this new flavor to anyone.
Not as good as others that I've brought!~,"Others are better in my opinion......Garvey's Organic Traditional Irish Soda Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)....I tried several types just not for me!~"
My favorite olive oil,"Everyone's tastes are different. But this is my absolute favorite olive oil. It has complexity, and has this incredible long smooth finish. I pour it over heirloom tomatos, or grilled asparagus, or just dip good bread into it!"
Tastes smooth,It has a smooth clean taste to it. I can drink a lot more of this water with out that bloated feeling I normally get from other water.  I've read about the benefits but I can't honestly say I feel any of them. I only tried one case.
"Slightly fruity, soothing decaf red tea","I've had to cut back on caffeine, so I've been trying out various herbal teas. This so far is my favorite. It has a slightly fruity, vanilla and mild tobacco scent and flavor to it. Coffee was giving me heartburn, but this tea is nice and mild, and since it's decaf it can be enjoyed throughout the day. I drink it plain since it has natural sweetness - it is a wonderful calorie-free treat!"
Shape Ups,My overweight chihuahua likes these treats and I feel a little less guilty giving them to him.
"Weak, sometimes WON'T sweeten","I am used to KAL stevia, and having read some of the other reviews, perhaps the one I received was from a bad batch. But - I have had to use AT LEAST 4-5 times as much compared to KAL to sweeten most items, and for some items (i.e. my high protein breakfast drink) it just disappears. Never has quite the same ""sweet"" effect of the KAL either."
Great Training Treats,"My dogs love these treats - especially the Chicken flavor. They are small, but I find them to be perfect for training.  They are small, low in calories and of high quality so I don't feel bad about giving quite a few out when the dogs are working on learning new things or reinforcing good behavior.  The price on Amazon is much better than my local vendor and delivery is always fast.  Highly recommended."
too much fat,"tastes great, but too much fat like all the other dumbo brands.<br />suzie was much better than this - the flatbreads are so low fat.<br />why not make this also low fat?"
Quite possibly the worst product I have ever purchased in my life,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned."
More watery than expected; cats are not digesting it well,"Our cats usually get the ""green can"" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back."
Great Value,I love this product. It is a great price also. I will continue to order this chocolate.
"What else would you call this but ""Calm?""","I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues...but I needed it as much (if not more.)  We have not been disappointed.  In fact, this supplement has exceeded all  hopes and expectations.  I suspect that my anxiety issues were beginning to negatively impact an important relationship. That has improved as have all my other relationships.  I am much more patient and centered, much less needy.  I have also noticed that there are no more occasional heart palpitations, no more twitchy legs either...no twitches of any kind. Also, as a budding middle-aged runner, this product IS helpful with muscle recovery.  I wish we had known about this product when our younger son was running track and cross country in high school.  It would have been tremendously helpful.  As others have noted, ""Calm"" is a wonderful aid in getting a restful night's sleep. A good night's sleep in-and-of itself is tremendously important to one's overall health. I will try never let myself run out of this supplement.  What a discovery!"
This is not a pine honey,"I was looking for Rigoni Di Asiago Pine honey since it disappeared from my local stores. When I finally ordered it - I got Forest honey of the same brand. Forest honey is exceptionally good, but still not as good as Pine. So my 4 stars apply for Forest and I would give 5 stars to Pine. Now picture is for Pine and the description is for Forest. At the time of my purchase it was Pine in the description too. There is no way anyone can get Asiago Piney honey now as it was discontinued by manufacturer. I still highly recommend Forest for it is quality and very interesting, I would even say - intriguing taste. As a proof I only can say that I've finished one jar in a two days."
"Warning, More For Ethnic Hair","I've used other clear scalp and hair products, and been very happy with them.  I do like the smell of this product, and if used very, very sparingly, it does the job on my hair and scalp. Unfortunately, there were not directions, and nothing to indicate that the product was created for ethnic hair.  In fact, I was unaware of the fact until I started looking at the other reviews here.  Hopefully, the company will correct that because it seems to be an excellent product, just not for me."
FANTASTIC!,"This salt is so good, you could almost eat it plain. I am telling you, sprinkling this with your fingers onto salads, chicken, fish, is amazing. Definitely don't waste this by cooking it, where you could use regular salt. This salt needs to be tasted as it really brings out the flavour of food in a really beautiful way. This is meant to be sprinkled on foods after they have cooked -- roasted chicken for example, or on raw vegetables like tomatoes or cucumbers. This is the Foodie's Salt!<br /><br />Now, I have noticed this salt is easier to buy in the regular grocery stores, so if you can, buy it there where it is cheaper to do so."
Mistaken Order,"It was our mistake, but we thought we were purchasing the much better boneless/skinless club sardines from Seasons, which are very good.  These are not as good, although they are better than the cheaper branded sardines."
There is a Difference,"I was skeptical about this product. I sometimes drink bottled water, but usually it's for the convenience more than anything else.<br /><br />I tried this product after refrigerating it for several hours. The texture is different. It's a slight difference, but I agree that it could be described as silky. The best feature, however, is the taste. It is clean and fresh. In fact, it is different enough from regular water (from the tap or bottled water) that I would consider serving it as a special beverage with a meal.<br /><br />It is expensive, but for those who want the best-tasting water and can afford the luxury, this is an excellent choice."
Great peppermint taste,"A lot of stevia flavorings have a chemical taste, but not this one.  I spray a few spritzes of this peppermint extract into my hot chocolate and no longer spend too much for a Starbucks Peppermint Hot Chocolate... for far fewer calories, too."
works great keeps the dog out of the garbage,I have used two bottles of this product and it does everything it claims.  My dog is staying off furniture and out of the garbage and no one has to say anything.
"Fast, balanced, exotic","This is fast and good. If you like curry this works. It is like a lot of the bottled Indian and Asian sauces, which sure makes for fast cooking. If you like it hotter go add red pepper paste or dry spice flakes. I think frozen peas go well with curry and naturally work with a white rice base."
good strong coffee,"I keep buying Emeril's Big Easy Bold K cups because I am limited to about one cup of REAL coffee each morning, and this is REAL, STRONG and DELICIOUS. If you like your coffee strong and use K-cups, this is the one for you."
Bad taste,"This product is sweetened with Splenda, and tastes very artificial. Maybe if you like diet soda you will like this, but the 3 people that sampled it did not."
That's a Darn Fine Cuppa' Joe!,"This is darn good coffee! I wound up ripping open the individual packets and just poring the grounds into filters for my regular drip coffee maker. But it's a nice rich flavor anyway, especially for pre-ground. And what a cool package! I mean, who doesn't like Bob Marley? Plus it says right on the box ""organic, ethically farmed,"" which I'm inclined to believe; somebody's gotta check on that stuff, right? Holy recommended."
Good old-fashioned jerky,"My wife bought a bag of this in an airport while traveling and brought it home for me, and I'm happy to say that I have a new favorite beef jerky brand! I like it because it has a simple, beefy taste with no frills and doesn't taste too salty. I also like how the pieces are solid, meaning no random stringy or fatty pieces which I hate. I've never seen this in local stores, so being able to get it in bulk from Amazon was a nice find."
"Just meh, nothing overly special","I had such high hopes for these but, as another reviewer noted, they taste no different than store-bought maraschino cherries.  As an added bonus for the store-bought variety, you don't have to wait very long to enjoy them, whereas these will take a couple of days to be processed and even more time before they arrive at your door."
Best ever: we use it every day to flavor our sparkling water!,"I bought this for a chicken recipe, but wound up using a tablespoon to bring zing<br />to our sparkling water every night at dinner.<br /><br />On my second order, and will order again and again.  NOt available in any store I shop at."
Amazing Service,"Package arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.<br /><br />The Product?<br /><br />These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had. You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.<br /><br />Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures."
Health Comes First,Knowing this China White Tea is good for the body is all that was needed for me to purchase this item.  It blends well for hot or cold tea and I'm happy with the purchase.
A Very Nice and Cute Gift Idea!,"I bought the Hometown Favorites 1950's Nostalgic Gift Box for my candy-loving teenagers. When the box was delivered yesterday, I couldn't resist taking a peek before I wrapped it. The box was full of great old-fashioned candy. I also couldn't resist nabbing a candy bar from the box to eat myself. There was much more candy in the box than I expected; the majority of the candy was big, full-size bars. I thought the display box was really cute too. The candy was packaged great, shipped fast and received in perfect condition. I was extremely pleased with the candy gift box and ordered several more to give to other family members. This is an incredible gift!"
its the only food my dog can eat,My dog has trouble with his food by the time i found some in knoxville it gones out of business no other place has it . But it got here on time
My Cats Love this Food!,I have eight cats and they all love this food! I like that it's natural with no by-products or fillers. It's made of high quality ingredients.
A little on the weak side...,"I have bought other Taylors products before and have enjoyed their quality, but felt this one wasn't quite up to their usual par.  I like a good strong cup of tea, and this was much milder and less malty in flavor than expected. Also, when I opened the bag, the tea leaves were very small, almost like filings; not the ""leaves"" I expected.  Don't know if I just got a bad batch or this was a bad year for this type, but don't think I would buy again.  Will stick to their South African Kwazulu tea- it's delicious."
Primula gift set,"There was a nice assortment of teas, but when the flowers ""bloomed""  they looked nothing like they do on the picture.  There were no vibrant colors, very drab... dead looking.  The tea did have an OK flavor, but not worth the extra $$$ in my opinion."
Solved our dog's food allergy problem...,"I was price checking on Amazon to see if I wanted to add Dog Food to our line-up for Amazon Prime purchases and was so surprised no one has reviewed this that I had to post -- in case there is someone out there in the desperate situation we were in 6 months ago.<br /><br />We have a pure bred retriever with horrible food allergies.  Among them is chicken we have figured out, but also something else (we suspect wheat).  She is 4 years old now and and while much loved, has cost us an absolute fortune in vet bills and throws up if she eats anything other than Royal Canin's Hypoallergenic diet.  She wasn't excited by the taste of the Royal Canin but ate it when she got hungry enough.  And no treats allowed, advised the vet.  How miserable.  We tried many many brands of dog food -- all top of the line, highly reviewed, and very expensive.  We transitioned gradually between foods.  We did all the right things.  Only Royal Canin helped (and it was bland, and expensive and required a ridiculous veterinary prescription). We were contemplating switching her a straight beef diet when we came across this product. We had happened to stop at a feed store out in the country and they swore by this line.  Said it was their top pick for dogs with allergies.  No wheat.  No corn.  And in this flavor the chicken was such a small amount they really didn't think it would hurt.  We bought a bag and have been on it ever since -- we now have a happy and healthy dog.  No more throwing up and the food bill (while not cheap) is much more tolerable.  I haven't been brave enough to try their dog treats but maybe...<br /><br />Oh -- and the price on Amazon for the 15 lb is a wee bit cheaper than retail locations in our area (by maybe $3-4).  Not as incredible a discount as the pricing on some of their other items I guess, but not worse than retail at least.  If you don't have Prime though, that would of course jack your price for shipping."
"Great value, good pantry staple","I really like this product. I find they soften in as little as 10 minutes or so. I simply sort through them and pull out the kind of mushrooms that I'm after (either porcini or chanterelles, for instance). The best part of using dried mushrooms is using the flavored water that the mushrooms steep in, such as pasta sauces, risotto, etc. I never throw it away.<br /><br />As to other people's comments about dirt or rocks, this is my second jar and I have never encountered that. Like dried beans, you should visually inspect the dried mushrooms before you add them to recipes; sometimes the steps do not revive well and stay tough. In general, reconstituted dried mushrooms do have a chewier texture. I encountered this when drying my own mushrooms. Some of this is just the process, not this particular product. I went to Italy last year and bought several packages of dried porcini and some of them were a bit chewy, too.<br /><br />You do get better and fresher dried mushrooms if you buy them in small quantities, but they are much, much more expensive. I use for Italian mushrooms for special occasions, and use these for my everyday cooking."
Greenies are Great,"When I got my dog he was 6 and had recently had his teeth cleaned.  Now he is 13 and, with eating a greenie a day, has not needed to have them done again.  He loves these treats!"
Awesome Crisps!!! Arrived in just 8 days in Texas from England!!!!,"These crisps are my favorite.  I ordered these expecting to get them in a month or two, and to my surprise they arrived in just 8 days!!!<br />I immediately ordered 8 more 6 packs, as my entire family wants these crisps.<br />Fantastic company I ordered from.  I am more than pleased!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X9XTIE"">Walkers Worcester Sauce Crisps 6 Pack 150g</a>"
YUCK!!!,"I personally purchase a lot of the 100 Calorie Snacks or the Rite Bite Snacks. I was excited to see a ""cheesecake"" bar in the 100 Calorie Section. However, I could NOT find these in any store near me! So, I ordered these & anxiously awaited their arrival...only to be VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! These bars are super dry, almost impossible to eat without a drink nearby. They do not taste anything like cheesecake. Even the graham cracker (Honey Maid) that is underneath the ""cheesecake"" is unbelievably dry & tasteless, almost like eating sawdust! Their is no ""moisture"" to the ""cheesecake"" layer what-so-ever, and it is grainy & gritty. I would not recommend these to anyone!!! If you really want some cheesecake & are on a diet, I say save up some calories for the end of your week & treat yourself to a piece of the real stuff, because you will be sorely disappointed with these bars! I only opened one of them, and made myself finish it because I cannot stand wasting food, it was a challenge to eat every bite!"
Dr. Harvey's Freeze-Dried Green Tripe Power Patties,Dr. Harvey's Freeze-Dried Green Tripe Power Patties my pup loves these things shippimg is super fast and are well packed
What question could you possibly have??,"Delicious. on everything.  bread, strawberries,  a chocolate quesadilla, nutella sandwich, nutella wrap, nutella on a banana, a spoon, on a diet? no problem: nutella on a chopstick"
Excellent!,"Absolutely delicious, light, gluten-free, low calorie, inexpensive lunch! I am on a perpetual diet, and nothing has made me happier than this soup. I like ramen soup, but the problem with regular Maruchan ramen is that it has msg and wheat (gluten) and also twice the sodium per packet and its preserved with TBHQ. All of which is bad for me. Also ramen is fried, these rice noodles are steam cooked, not fried. Best of all, if you get these from Amazon, they cost almost half the price compared to the supermarket. I mean the supermarket price was reasonble, but Amazon is Great!"
good food,"My dog has numerous allergies and have tried several foods, her ears are the biggest problem and she chews her feet and other areas. she is a golden and on  the food 3 weeks so need more time to detox old food and see how her skin does. In the past I know right away if a food works, she goes crazy itching in about 1 week. So far so good!"
The dogs love them!,"If your dogs have allergies as mine do, feed them duck and fish. They will love these salon treats! A little bit stinky, but that's all the better for dogs!"
Not for everyone!,"I absolutely LOVE popchips!  So far, I have tried the plain (really don't like these - no flavor at all), BBQ (very nice, rather sweet - I do like these) and Salt & Pepper (by FAR my favorite).  The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste ""weight"" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.  I would suggest going on PopChips website and see where they are sold locally, around me they are sold at Target Stores."
its ok,not as impressed as I had hoped. the standard blend is still my favorite. the is wroth buying but there is better out there. to each there own.
Better products available,"Lots of work for a product that is<br />a. difficult to keep cap on k-cup<br />b. Keurig maker does not seem to recognize it correctly...coffee varies in amount filtered through Kaps<br />c. leaks around inserted My-Kap<br /><br />I have found the Keruig brand reusable filter to work better, but I also purchased an ekobrew filter which is my favorite. I will limit purchasing K-Cups even though they are by far more convenient, but the ekobrew works without removing the insert on the machine."
Tull's Italian roast,"This too is excellant as a tall iced-coffee.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M62D5S"">Tully's Italian Roast, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> Also like it as a med/lg hot coffee."
Great product - poor Amazon price,"My son has yet to refuse anything made by Earth's Best. Granted, he eats all his food but these are interesting combinations. The ingredients are simple--veggie, water, meat. Some absorbic acid. I highly recommend the product.<br /><br />I do not, however, recommend buying it here. The ""regular"" price that is crossed out is absolutely absurd. I have not seen this product over $10 in any store. Perhaps that's the price in NYC."
Tastes like Cough Syrup..it's a shame,"I tried this full strength, diluted, at various temperatures....cough syrup..and nasty cough syrup at that. I can't believe they put this product out there. I love diet cream soda. I need good caffeine free/sugar free non acidic ( not fruit flavored ) drinks for my medical conditions. I usually buy waist watchers cream soda but I recently moved and can't get it in this state. I guess my BF will have to keep shipping it to me from PA because soda stream's version is undrinkable. I hope they re-do the recipe because a GOOD diet cream soda would be one of their biggest sellers. This is a shame."
"Love, Love this Olive Oil","I bought this olive oil because of the Barefoot Contessa show just to see what it was all about.  When I got it and used it, OH MY GOD!  It truly is the best I have ever used!!! Great, great flavor... It's getting hard to find though, whats up with that?"
Addicting,"Have been a Maxwellhouse coffee drinker (Maxwellhouse lite) for 30 years.  Got tired of the bland tasting black water.  Bought the Breville smart grinder, the Bunn VP-17 and the 8 O'Clock coffee 50% decaf.  Now coffee drinking is a whole different world.  Got it all from Amazon in 2 days.  Best place to purchase these."
"Good flavor and value, but would like larger size",These taste great and are a good value with free shipping.  My only<br />gripe is that they are small and get soggy faster than bigger croutons.<br />The resealable bags are a big plus!
Only bought it,Bought it for the ice cream maker which did not make ice cream since then sitting in the fridge.
Heat Peanuts are RARE,"Planters Heat Peanuts, 1.75-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 108)<br /><br />Offered on Amazon as teaser, but not available for order. What gives?"
Best tasting coconut water,"This is the only brand of coconut water I've tried that doesn't have a weird aftertaste...or bits in the water. It's the best sport/energy drink out there...since coconut water is isotonic, natural, and doesn't have sugars added. Great for recovery...even from hangovers!"
Delicious but delicate,"I've been getting this bread for 4 years now and it is my favorite g/f bread.  Albeit not for lunch meat sandwiches but for toast and peanut butter in the morning or a sweet little mid-day bite, it's great.  Just be careful to turn your toaster down as the bread is thin (1/2"") and slices are smaller (4"" square roughly)."
Large Milk Bone Biscuits,"My MinPin loves to walk around with these in his mouth, guess it makes him feel bigger."
I LOVE this product,I absolutely LOVE this product. I order and reorder this product every time I need to spend a little more money to get my free shipping with amazon. This is always my go to product. Everyone I have had try this product really loves it and ask me for to give them the product info which I do. I want to help support this company by all means. Thank you for a great product.
BigFamilyBound,"My son used this formula and had no problems with it. However it is very expensive, but it is a good product. Just wish they would not charge so much as parents spend TONS of money on formula and other essentials for children. It worked well for our family, and will continue to use it with our next baby."
"I see all the rave reviews, but I have to bash it...","Dark roast is its own league...the amino profiles of the beans change considerably.  But with that said, I've had high altitude dark roasts that were much better.  In fact, this coffee STINKS when you open the bag and sniff the beans.  I ground it coarsely and used a french press...poured in about 20 seconds...and guess what...it still doesn't smell good.  Drinking it black, it's smooth, not bitter, but flat on the palette.  I don't understand all the rave reviews...this coffee sucks.  I'd rather drink pre-ground maxwell house that's been sitting around for 30 minutes (yuck).  Maybe you can cook with it (in caramel since its not bitter, maybe) but I wouldn't bother drinking it...it sucks.  There is considerable crema and oil...but the taste is flat.  I also ordered Lavazza (Tierra) for moka ""espresso"" but it brews up better than almost every other bean I've tried.  Also Cameron's Organic ""toasted southern pecan"" coffee really surprised me (I don't like flavored coffees)...I love it.  Save your $$ and avoid these beans...get a brazilian dark roast instead..."
Kashi GOLEAN Crunch,"Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />Great cereal!!!!  My favorite!!!! Healthy and good for you!"
Hibiscus is a hit,The hibiscus tea is exactly as described and Amazon shipped the item very quickly. This newer packaging appears to be mylar or aluminum lined. This helps to keep the tea fresh between brewings.<br /><br />I bought it for its positive health benefits. Since drinking 3 to 4 cups a day my diastolic bp has decreased about 10 points and my cystolic bp has dropped about 8 points. To be completely transparent I am also drinking the same amount of Davison's Bulk Rooibos Tea per day.<br /><br />Both teas taste great. The hibiscus smells like fragrant flowers and tastes just a bit sour but that's fine.  The rooibos has a different frangrance and tastes smoother and more delicate compared to the hibiscus.<br /><br />I just ordered more rooibos tea and will order more hibiscus when the bag gets low.
dog loves it,"Obviously I am not going to taste this stuff.  But the dog loves it.  In fact he likes it so much that he no longer wants eat his regular food, so I am now using the as treat food.  Really can't find anything bad to say about the food.  Our dog goes the town on it with the same zeal he normally holds for wet food."
Great healthy dog food,I'm very pleased with this dog food.  Haven't ordered anything else for my dogs since I bought this.  My lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and I'm happy that it is healthy for them.
"berry tasty,","Good quality of tea, I will order more berry soon.<br />I like all the flavors, the good think is that they really taste like the flavor description."
Will Definitely Buy Again!,"I ran out of the nutritional yeast that I got at the store and decided to try Bob's Red Mill brand.  I was a little nervous to buy a pack of four, but since it could be frozen I decided to take the plunge.  I received my order in about 2 days (yeah Amazon!) and I already had a recipe that I was ready to try it with...Vegan Mac and Cheeze.  Nothing like jumping in with both feet to test out a new product!  I was very happy with the results.  The recipe turned out exactly as described and the Bob's Red Mill Nutritional yeast tasted fantastic.  My 3 year old son LOVED it and repeatedly said ""Yum, I like the cheesy noodles!"" For someone that is relatively new to being vegan, this is a great product for taste and also to get that illusive B12 into my diet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  1. Great tasting (I add to salads, soups, noodles, etc.)<br />  2. Easy to use (The 8oz. packages allow you to use a little at a time and freeze the rest)<br />  3. Good source of vitamin B12 for vegans<br />  4. Good quality (I have always been happy with products from Bob's)<br /><br />Not-So-Pros:<br />  1. Flakes are a little larger than other brands (this isn't a huge deal and I knew this ahead of time since it is called ""large flake yeast"")<br /><br />I will definitely keep this on my ""Subscribe and Save"" list!"
"Very yummy and is fruit, no artificial flavors",It does have locust bean and guar gum in it. It is a 1:2 ratio to make smoothies 1 cup mix to 2 cups ice and water. Tastes very good and natural.
Bigelow Lemon Lift Tea,Lemon Lift by Bigelow has been a favorite of mine for many years.  The foil packaging keeps the tea fresh.
Tasted Like Ammonia!,"So I made one bag of these pork rinds & it came out good! I decided to try another & the taste was unbelievable - it had an ammoniated taste & smell to it! I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasn't caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out."
Yum!,"High fructose corn syrup or real fruit juice aside, I love haribo gummy bears.  I actually went to a shop in Germany called gummy bear land and bought a rather large bag while on vacation.  If those were the fruit juice kind, I actually didn't like them as much.  But to have ""healthy candy"" would be nice.  This is a great deal for a great gummy candy, can't go wrong.  And with Prime, when you get the craving, they show up nice and fast.  :)"
Great Organic baby food,"I love this food for my baby and especially the packaging.  Great for feeding baby on the go.  It is a bit liquidy, but its good for my baby.  I like to mix with oatmeal for breakfast.  Great price too compared to the grocery store."
I love these cashews! Great flavor!,I can easily finish a bag of these cashews in one sitting. The cashews are slightly glazed and sweet with a great crunchy texture. I have to buy these nuts in bulk because my whole family loves them! I also have a hard time finding them in the stores so I was very pleased to see Amazon selling them-- and at a great price! Highly recommend this product.
Seriously Delicious.,"Yummy. I am allergic to peanuts (Mildly, like many, many other people) and just never really cared for peanut butter all that much. I still always liked certain peanut butter candies and cookies though.<br /><br />I recently decided to go Vegan-ish which to my knowledge requires lots of pb&j's. Since I am taking care of myself (...my body), I have chosen not to eat peanut butter. I was totally bummed about not enjoying pb&j's like other vegans and vegan wannabe's, until I spied this stuff on sale in a grocery store flier. I did a quick search before shelling out the clams for this pricey treat(I think I searched taste and sunflower seed butter) And found a great comparison of the two butters (peanut vs. sunflower) and decided to go for it.<br /><br />So Glad I did. It is totally worth it. I am currently trying to find a recipe for sunflower seed butter though due to the cost compared to the cost of just plain sunflower seeds... Found this for sale on amazon with only two measly reviews and thought I should let whomever is interested know... This product is certainly worth the moolah but you are going to want to eat so much of it that the cost may be a bit imperative to your taste buds' desires for more more more sunbutter.<br /><br />Perfect for peanut free classrooms, lunchrooms schools, whatever. It tastes remarkably similar to peanut butter with a Slightly runnier consistency. I recommend a good stirring with each use (stirring sunbutter is way easier than stirring those natural peanut butters). Store opened container in fridge to prolong freshness.<br /><br />To my peanut allergic taste buds sun-butter tastes like peanut butter without whatever the weird stuff is in peanut butter that makes it taste slightly off (other than hydrogenated oils, of course) and it comes without that weird yet vaguely appealing peanut butter scent.<br /><br />I am going to try making sun-butter ""peanut butter"" cookies sometime soon. I have missed those since giving up peanut butter a few years ago."
Wonderful,"This shampoo is awesome.  I used it on my dry scalp and it moisturized it right up!  I used the conditioner along with this product and it made my hair very soft.  The bottle is a nice size and easy to open.  The shampoo, in my opinion, smelled heavenly!  However, when the product was shipped, the container had leaked and there was shampoo all in the bag it came in.  Other than the bottle spilling, this is a great product."
Good snacks,Such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks.  The arrived quickly.  So easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack.
Great Tasting and Satisfying!,"I've been looking into finding more high protein snacks with low carbs and calories and this snack fits the bill.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the high sodium content.  I'd really like to see a lower sodium version of these sticks, even if it's just removing 100mg of sodium would be great.<br /><br />But it tastes great, everyone in the family likes them.  I've tried the spicy pepper from a local store and loved it, but it would have been too spicy for the kids so I purchased the 2 boxes of terriyaki from Amazon.  I'll probably buy the spicy again and just horde it for myself while getting bbq as well so the kids can have those."
Red Beans n Rice better than my own and 10 times faster.,"While living in Mississippi, my Illinois reared husband became enamored with his company cafeteria's red beans 'n rice.  For 3 decades, I've been working to create the best. The best?  Popeye's can't be beat!!  Finally, I've found it on my own range.  No, my NOLA daughter did.  Blue Runner does it.  Fix the rice.  Warm up some pork.  Open the can.  Dilute and warm the contents.  Combine.  Comfort food, oh, oh, oh, comfort food.  I use 1/2 cup white wine to dilute.  (Cider could be interesting.)  And I add two minced garlic cloves.  I hear you can find Blue Runner locally if you live farther south in the South than we do now; but for me, Amazon is truly the greatest."
Very nutritious and tasty; get it for less on Amazon,"I discovered KIND bars in stores like Wild Oats and Whole Foods.  They are made of a combination of dried fruit and nuts.  Each bar has a unique flavor and provides a satisfying snack.  I also eat these bars regularly after workouts.<br /><br />In stores, KIND bars are usually about $2/each.  So, Amazon's 8-pack is a great deal."
"Love this cereal, but $31 (plus $15 s&h)?!?","I remember this cereal from when I was a kid, but I couldn't seem to find it anywhere. So I signed up to be notified when it became available from Amazon, lo and behold less than a week later I got an email telling me that it had become available. I was very pleased, until I saw the price tag. When a box of cereal costs over $46 (including s&h) it becomes less a novelty from your childhood and more a luxury item. I'm in college right now, I have just enough money for only a few luxury items; $45 is not a luxury I can afford. Five stars for the cereal, but I hope no one is foolish enough to buy it at this price."
My dog adores these delicious treats,"My dog has long displayed a preference for cheese above nearly any other substance, so I was delighted when a friend gave him one of these as a Christmas gift.  He loved it!  This is a healthy treat (in moderation, of course) and allows you to give your dog cheese without treading in ""human food"" territory, which many of us try to avoid.  You can fulfill the craving while still maintaining some semblance of order....  This is a fantastic treat, definitely the best cheese-related dog snack I've come across yet.  Great job!"
Has trouble dissolving,"I tried this product to be used in my cold iced tea and limeaid.  I have also used Stevita packets.  Compared to Stevita, the Better Stevia packets don't dissolve in cold drinks easily.  With Stevita, I can simply swirl the glass with a little water and get the packet contents to completely dissolve; with this product, I had to use a spoon to stir vigorously and it still left 'clumps'.  Maybe it works better in warm beverages but it's a pain in cold drinks."
Unbelievable snack,"I ordered these as a suggestion from the Hungry Girl Website, my husband and I Love them.  No nasty after taste, delicious and still healthy."
good product,The product is amazing and I love the taste of it. It's better to mix it with yogurt than cereal.
Crunchy and strong ginger flavor,"We loved this cookies. I was surprised at how much ""gingery"" the cookies taste. Also they were very crunchy which made it a very satisfying cookie.<br /><br />My husband loves to have cookies with his afternoon coffee. He tried the ginger snap cookies and absolutely fell in love with them. I had to take the package out of his hands or he would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting!<br /><br />The package includes a little tape to close the bag. Very useful if you do not eat the entire bag in one sitting.<br /><br />The list of ingredients are: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (Ginger, Sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Mono-calcium Phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. I can pronounce all those ingredients so the claim of organic holds.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cookies for those who like ginger snap cookies."
great for college kids,"Great taste, and healthier than most other organic milks in aseptic cartons. Especially great that they last so long for us college kids. Recommended."
It's rye seed. What's to review?,Rye seed in a large can. My product arrived promptly and as advertised. No mold or any other damage. I have no complaints.
Yummy gluten-free breakfast option,"This is delicious. I'd eat this even if not gluten-intolerant. Most g-f cereals taste like dust or have so much sugar content to make them palatable. This cereal tastes great, has flavor and is perfect with Greek yoghurt."
Quality taste,I am not an avid coffee fan but drink it on ocassion.  I use half the packet and it is perfect for my palate.  I buy VIA to have on hand for guests since I don't own a coffee maker.  Worth the extra cost for quality taste.
The Price is Right,"I have very long thick hair and have been coloring it for years, so no matter how often I get my hair trimmed most of it is dry and fairly fragile. Although the aroma of this product is a little lighter than the others products of this line that I have tried, it is still a little over-powering for my taste.  My hair scent clashes with my perfume.  I hate that and that is why I try always to purchase fragrance free products.<br /><br />But that issue aside- this product seems to do what it claims to do.<br /><br />I'm always looking for an inexpensive product that may be the equivalent of a salon product. Well I'm sorry there just aren't any, but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most.<br /><br />I did seem to see less hair in my comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower, my scalp seems to bee less dry  and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.<br /><br />After drying and using the heated flate iron on my hair it appeared silky, somewhat shiny and was quite  easy to manage."
Kim P.,"I like fennel seeds.  I use them in variety of ways; in my meatballs/spaghetti sauce but I usually snack on them...as is.  However, I don't like the taste of the extremely pungent fennel seeds so Spicy World's gives me exactly what I want-enough crunch and just enough zing of fennel flavor.  Unless you have a strong stomach(like me), I would not recommend snacking on these raw(maybe mix them with sunflower seeds and raisins..may seem a bit unusual for snacking..great fiber, helps with your digestive system..endless benefits!)  If you are not comfortable munching on them, then try steeping them in a tea.  Again, wonderful and endless health benefits!!"
"Great design, good coffee","Count me among the fans. I love the lower-waste design of these k-cup compatible pods. It is a mild inconvenience keeping them in an airtight container, but the investment in a tight-sealing jar paid for itself with the first case. It was smart to package them in bags of 12, so each bag is only open for about a week.  The coffee is good. Not astonishingly strong, but pretty rich and balanced. They don't advertise it here, but the company's coffee is fair trade/direct trade as well!"
"A Great Spicy, Healthy Snack!!","Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy, give these a try."
"Great toy, but ""gnawhide"" rings need to last longer.","I am a huge fan of Premier's products and toys for dogs. After our dog trainer recommended them, I purchased several for my standard poodle puppy. The Bouncy Bone toy is a great treat for my dog and keeps her occupied for a few minutes. If the ""gnawhide"" rings were made to last longer, I'd be thrilled. My dog is able to get both rings off in less than five minutes, which tells me there's not much of a challenge. I do like the fact that the toy unscrews and the ball can be used as a separate toy."
Easy to get to al dente.,This pasta is great.  You have to salt and olive oil to the water to get it to a good al dente.  I had no problems with it clumping or falling apart like the other reviewers did.  Excellent texture for a GF pasta.  Will definitely buy again.
Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.,"I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect."
Doesn't taste great,"I bought this based on the other reviews stating it tasted as good or better than peanut butter.  It tastes like sunflower seeds ground up to make a buttery spread.  I know, shocking.  My son hates it.  Wish I hadn't bought packs of it before testing it out on him."
Weak,"As a serious coffee drinker, I should have read the other reviews. My coffee preferences are Bold and Dark blends. I like a strong cup of coffee and this was very watery to me. I brewed it on the smallest cup size and still thought it was weak.<br />it smells amazing. But if you like a good strong cup of coffee do not buy this. My roommate who prefers lighter coffee, really liked this one. She can keep the extras, im going for that dark Roast cup of coffee.<br />And if you arent sure if you are a DARK or a LIGHT roast person, if you prefer your morning cuppa at Starbucks- then you prefer a dark roast. If you prefer a cup from Dunkin or krispy, you like the lighter roasts- so this cinnamon roll would satisfy you."
Kamir the Large Brown Cat Loves These,These really hit the spot.  They used to be at Restoration Hardware at Christmas and we doled them out very stingily.  Great to have them in bulk!<br /><br />Kamir the Large Brown Cat<br />kamirthelargebrowncat.blogspot.com
Cats love it,"I have two female Siamese kittens who love this food. When they get into the closet where I keep it, they chew through the bag. They are mostly on a canned food diet, though they still get a little dry food each day in a food ball (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CG40O"">PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball, Blue</a>), and they love it. They always come running when they hear the rattling of the food in the ball (if they're not already there watching me fill it up). I have the chicken and salmon dry foods, and though they love both, they seem to like the salmon slightly more. Unfortunately, the salmon is a bit more smelly. I definitely plan on purchasing this product again."
"Larabar Bars, Cashew Cookie",Great tasting bar. Nice and soft make it easy to eat.
DOG FOOD,"DOG FOOD SMELLED GOOD WHEN I OPEND THE PACKAGE. SORRY TO SAY, MY DOGS DID NOT LIKE THE FOOD SO MUCH. I AM STILL MIXING WITH THE OLD FOOD. HOWEVER I WILL NOT CONTINUE TO FEED IT. THANKS"
Awesome coffee,These little k-cups have me drinking more coffee than ever...two in the morning...one at lunch and one in the evening...almost every day. It is definitely my favorite of the k-cups I've tried.
Almost...,"I've got 2 cats that love their wet food!!  We figured this'd be a big hit & for the 1st couple cans it was.  My cats are used to your everyday  mushy cat food (Friskies I think), so when we opened this stuff I was surprised to see that this stuff actually looked almost some what edible.  It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(."
love it,"This tastes just like the iced tea you buy at Starbucks. I like it better because I make it with purified, filtered water. Great tea"
Dog food,My husband and I both think this looks like and tastes like dog food. We were very sad and couldn't even eat more than one nugget size bite. We wish we had a way to return it! What a waste of money.
Best-tasting larabars,"This is our favorite flavor, we order in bulk from Amazon instead of paying a lot more at our local grocery store.  We are doing the paleo diet and these are great ""sweet"" tasting snacks."
good for a dog if i have one,"I love jack link beef jerky especially the peppered flavor one. here I was hoping I would get  a great tasting beef jerky from Jack link. I'm in for a surprise, I don't know about the people who gave this product a 5 star but to me this deserve a -1. First, there is no taste or flavor to this thing not even with a peppered one. second, it's hard like plastic ( i thought i was chewing on plastic). don't get me wrong I love jack link beef jerky but this thing is meant for animal, to be honest I'm not even sure any dog would want this."
Soup pretty good but packaging sucked,"While I enjoyed the soup itself, I must join the other reviewers who complained about DENTED CANS.  Yes, 9 out of the 12 cans in my last shipment were slightly to moderately DENTED.  Ugh!  Is Amy's unloading its dented cans on unwitting Amazon customers?  Anyway, folks, this item is not eligible for return but a very accommodating customer service agent just gave me a refund.  I will not buy this item from Amazon again, due to this DENTED CAN issue.  I will pay a little more and get it from one of the other online health food stores that will ship me an undented can."
Just what I needed,"This product was great for my needs. The jar size is perfect. I just wish it was packed better (one jar lost during shipment). It's also too bad Mott's doesn't put their applesauce into large, plastic containers."
ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS IDEA!!!,"I was looking for a selection of k-cups but having commitment issues. I just couldn't bring myself to commit to buy 24 cups of Vanilla Creme or Toffee or a certain decaf blend, without actually knowing what it tasted like. And the pre-packaged mixed selections already had half the flavors I wasn't interested in. This is an ingenious idea! I just ordered a wide selection of exactly what I wanted to taste. Ordered it Saturday, the seller emailed me back within two hours of receiving my order email, and mailed it out Monday morning. Package received Wednesday. Great service, all the flavors I want to try. Can't recommend this enough to folks!"
Fresh New Flavor.Somewhat Coarse Brown Mustard. Good!,"I've been shopping the gourmet and international isle of my local grocery store lately. I guess it must be out of boredom for the regular things I have in my diet. In any case, I've found some real interesting things. Here's one: Zatarains Creole Mustard. Mmmmm. good! It's not overly hot and is about the same as my regular Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard, but it has a different mix of spices that give it a fresh new flavor. I can't see anything in the ingredients that would make it stand out so, but it does and I'm hard placed to describe the flavor. Perhaps the secret is in the vinegar. It's a brown mustard and is somewhat coarsely ground. Quite good!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
healthy ingredients,"i don't eat them often.. i'm not a big cookie eater..<br />i wasn't grown up with the holiday sweets, being asian, and growing up with grand parents..<br />but these are great.! the ingredients are what i love<br />when i look at the nutritional packaging, its not as attractive..<br />but the sugar and fat are from natural sources like fruit juice (which contains vitamins and minerals) and sun flower seeds and unprocessed  vegetable oil.. essential fatty acids..<br />the taste is also good, a bit too sweet for me, but i like the chewy sunfloer seeds"
"Tasted the passion fruit, had the pulps, and had the refreshing effetc, but..","The taste does have a hint of passion fruit, but more sweet than fruit.  If you like a `fruity' tea without the heavy doses of fruit flavor then this could work for you; unless you do not like pulps.  You cant avoid the pulp texture in every gulp and what is a little interesting is the suspension of these pulps even when the bottle is rested for a while: real fruit related drinks you will find the heavier pulps separate and sits in the lower half of the container.  For the conscious eater, I am unlikely to purchase this item as part of my healthier eating plan, but rated on the ability of the drink to provide a `refreshing' sensation, then it does the trick."
Bold Taste,"This is my husbands favorite.  We have tried another ""bold"" coffe but he knows the difference and this is his preference."
garbanzo beans,the product was fresh and viable and the shipping was fast and fair! will use again!
I didn't know I love peacans!,I didn't know I love peacans until I tried Valdosta Pecans!  I am trying to eat only food that is both good for me AND also tastes really good.  The Sahale Valdosta Peacans are good for you and they taste great! I have got to reorder some more ASAP!
Bandit is right!  Never again!!,"The bandit sent me Generic, substandard candy when I purchased name brand.  When I wrote to them they told me they would correct my order; however, after receiving no replacement I emailed them and of course they wouldn't respond.<br /><br />The CandyBanditt is the perfect name for this outfit.  Probably some fat dude or chick working out of their garage taking money from honest people."
A great sampler!,"Before buying this product, I was worried that there wouldn't be enough variety.  When I received the package which contained the K cups packed into a brown paper lunchbag [they did indicate that this is the way they are shipped], I was very excited to see what flavors were inside!  It felt like Christmas morning.  I was pleased to find that all of the K cups were intact and there were a wide variety of flavors, including seasonal and special edition flavors.  Yes, there are a few flavors that are in particular abundance, but they are the most commonly enjoyed flavors so I think it is reasonable.  There are a lot of Green Mountain flavors which I have no problem with because Green Mountain coffee is excellent.  I was happy when I saw 2 Timothy's Kahlua K cups because that's a flavor I've really been wanting to try!  Here's the tally:<br />Green Mountain Coffee French Vanilla 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Hazelnut Noisette 6<br />Timothy's Kahlua 2<br />Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry 4<br />Green Mountain Coffee Gingerbread 2<br />Gloria Jean's Mudslide 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Caramel Vanilla Cream 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Southern Pecan 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Mocha Nut Fudge 1<br />Total 35<br />That's right... I ordered the 34 count and they sent me 35.  The 35 count is $2.12 more than the 34 count on Amazon, so this decision definitely paid off!  That was generous, or perhaps clumsy of the sellers.  Either way, I will take this in a positive light.  Overall it was a good purchase!"
Get rid of pantry moths,If your pantry is inundated with moths (or weevil-types) - this trap will take care of the moths that hatch after you clean out your pantry. With the long life cycle that these pests have - you need something to catch new ones. Even if you clean out your food and put everything kept in storage containers there may still be some rogue eggs (you would be amazed at what these pests like to lay their eggs in!) I found eggs in clean brown lunch sacks. It wouldn't even be unreasonable to use these traps before you have a pest problem. Very safe!
Tastes horrible not worth it,"I got the energy boost of drinking a cup of coffee, however had to hold my nose while drinking it it was so bad. Sticking to coffee which isn't great but is much cheaper and doesn't have all these chemical additives."
Delicious,"I was looking for something with a good taste and less ""chemical"" ingredients so I decided to give this a try. BINGO! This is great tasting."
Great Variety,"This is the perfect option for those who want to try all the PopChips varieties! Haven't gotten to try them all yet, but two outta six are awesome so far! :)"
Great way to sneak in Veggies!,"My 2 year old is a picky eater and refuses most fruits and veggies.  I usually sneak them in via a smoothie.  I ran across this superfood powder and decided to give it a try.  She loves it and asks for it every morning and drinks it all w/o a problem!  I haven't tasted it myself but as long as she likes it, I can't complain.  For some reason my 4 year old dislikes it but she is a kid that will eat her broccoli and ask for more so she doesn't need it like my younger one."
My Two Dogs Love It,I have been purchasing my dog's food at Costco. I have been mixing the chicken and lamb Kirkland brand with the more expensive Organic Kirkland mix. My two dog's (Akita and Black Lab) have been eating their food for a couple of years now and seemed to be enjoying it enough. However when I added the Beneful to the mix of the other two foods they absolutely loved it. They ate it in record time. Wow what enthusiasm. I have since run out of this 15.5 lb bag and purchased some more from Costco. Now they hardly eat the Kirkland brand. I had to go and purchase a 50 lb bag of Beneful and mix it in again to get them to eat their food.<br /><br />I don't know how it tastes but I can say that my dogs both love it. I have been adding diatomaceous earth powder to their bowls mixed with one raw egg lately and they are really liking it. They seem to have more energy too. I am trying to rid them of any internal parasites. I am also rubbing it into their coats to control fleas and ticks.
HORRID!,I have bough Larry's coffee in the past and it was ok. This last batch was awful! The beans were not fresh and it taste only slightly better than Maxwell house! do yourself a favor and get coffee from coffee bean direct on amazon. WAY better coffee at a way better price
Delicious!,Was looking for a good sauce with no sugar and this fit the bill.  So tasty.  I have on subscribe and save and the price is definitely right for the quality of ingredients and convenience.  I am so glad I found it.
Surprisingly Good,"I can't exactly tell you what it was that I expected when I agreed to sample and review these, but they're definitely a lot better than I thought they would be. My reaction to things that are blueberry flavored varies a lot, and this is definitely one of the better products I've come across in that area.<br /><br />They're not a super health food, but they're not meant to be. They're pretty reasonable as treats go. The serving size of 3 fruit thins for 140 calories is satisfying, and it's nice that there's a bit of protein and fat in the mix to help keep you from being hungry again 5 minutes later.<br /><br />I liked these a lot and I expect to buy them from time to time in the future as a nice treat."
Full of Flavor and Aromatic,"This tea surprised me. I tend to like strong flavored teas like Irish breakfast tea, but this light white tea is full of flavor and refreshing without being overpowering. It is the perfect pick-me-up after dinner without worrying that it will keep me up all night. I liked the aroma it gave off, too. This is an all around good tea at an excellent price."
Wonderful & healthy,"This stuff is great.  This is the second pack of 6 I have purchased.  The gold dash flax seems to be less noticeable then the regular when added to food/recipes.  I put ground flax on my son's peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Both boys don't even notice it when I use this gold dash flax !  I also use it in my pancake batter, muffins, waffles, etc."
"Good candy, but look for the 12 pack from amazon","This candy was excellent, very soft and fresh still. Tastes almost like strawberry marshmallows more than a gummy. However it was 6 dollars for one pretty small bag, because it is an import.<br /> http://www.amazon.com/Haribo-Gummi-Candy-Strawberries-5-Ounce/dp/B000EVQWKW/ref=pd_sbs_gro_12  Amazon has almost the exact same thing, 12 packs for $14 so closer to 1 dollar per pack instead of 6. If you love this candy, that's the way to go."
Awesome Buttery Incredibleness,"We can't get enough of these GF pretzels. They taste very buttery and rich. My son LOVES them. the twists are excellent, too."
NICE,Its not as energizing as I thought it would be but it does give you nice little pick me-up during the course of the day.
Bionature Gluten Free Pastas,"I have never been a fan of regular pastas but my wife would eat pasta everyday and anyway it was fixed.  She was diagnosed with celiac disease about 4 years ago so we needed to find a pasta that she could eat.  After many trial and error processes we tried the Bionature pastas and they are wonderful.  Even I enjoy this pasta, and we eat it at least twice a week.<br />It is more epensive that other gluten free pastas, but it is well worth the extra cost.  I order the spaghetti, macaroni, fusilli, and the penne rigata by the case (6 or 12 pkgs.), and I have found no place cheaper than Amazon, especially with their free shipping.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0YW"">bionaturae Organic Penne Rigate, Gluten Free, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4P00"">bionaturae Organic Spaghetti, Gluten Free, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI1L8"">bionaturae Organic Fusilli, Gluten Free, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTC17S"">bionaturae Organic Elbow Pasta, Gluten Free, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
Coffee that is exotic hits the mark!,"We were surprised when the packages were for one cup portions.  We are not used to brewing coffee this way.  However, that aside, it is very easy to overcome the simple obstical and brew.  We put the packages (out of the freshness wrapper of course)in the basket where we normally put the grounds.<br /><br />We had to guess how many for a full pot, but we decided that one per cup would do the trick.  It did and we were very happy with the results. This is a full flavored coffee and since we do not add cream or sugar, got the full benefit.  This is a good product and if you have one of those single cup brewers, then this will be even better.<br /><br />The only downside is that if they had some good instructions on how to brew a single cup included they would most likely have higher sales. The roast is really full flavored and delicious."
THE BEST APPLE CHIPS EVER!!!!!!,"I absolutely LOVE these apple chips. My order of 12 (2.5 oz bags) came on Wednesday and they were gone by the following Saturday. I actually just placed another order today as well. I can't get enough! I'm not even a big fan of apples but there is just something so delicious about these apple chips. I've tried most of the flavors and the original and cinnamon are the best. I suggest everyone try these, but know you will probably be addicted after the first bag. Yum!"
best chocolate in the world,"Godiva chocolate is the best chocolate in the world, I think, and the person we purchased it from was quick and efficient in sending it.  The price on Amazon was the best I found anywhere.  When you want to give the very best to the very best for doing their very best, give Godiva chocolates."
Yummy!!,It is hard to find O's that are free of gluten soy and corn. My daughter will only eat O shaped cereal and we haven't been any to find any. This one is yummier than the others with better ingredients. Hard to find in stores so i was happy to see it on Amazon and happy to buy a 9-pack.
Sahales Snacks,The product from Sahales was great.  We have ordered it several times and will order it again.  It is one of the best snack foods because of the ingredients.
Useless for me.,"This product did absolutely nothing for me. I even tried taking multiple at a time and still no increased in any type of energy. I've read elsewhere the regular caffeine users do not benefit from this kind of energy drink-- I am unsure if that is accurate, but I do consume caffeine daily."
Switched to O.N.E.,Must admit the taste of O.N.E. coconut water is better.  Took a long time to get through the supply of coconut water.
Great Variety Hot Sauce Pack,"The Cholula hot sauce was great, I already knew I loved the original flavor, but the chipotle and the garlic flavor were a definite 5 star. I gave it a 4 star because the lime flavor wasn't that tasty. The pak gave me the opportunity to try out the other flavors, so now I know which ones I would buy again.  I especially enjoy the Cholula brand because it's just hot enough to still enjoy your meal."
Best new flavor!,"Okay, usually I buy organic cake mixes, but this was a new and unusual flavor so on an impulse I bought a package at my local Farm Fresh grocery store. I baked it in a bundt pan and only dusted it w/ organic powdered sugar as a frosting. All of us thought it was incredibly delicious. It does not taste artificial (like the strawberry cake flavor does-another impulse buy that I will NOT repeat). I wish it did not contain partially hydrogenated oil, but nonetheless it is soooo tasty, that I will continue to buy it."
drink this coffee all the time,"I drink this coffee all the time, its one of the best Dolce Gusto's basics, not to strong, not to light in taste.. Just like all the other coffees by Nescafe you have to add cream and sugar to make the coffee just right.<br />I would have to agree with everyone else that the price for all the Dolce Gusto's coffee is high. My husband and I drink one cup of coffee per day, and before you know it the coffee is gone..."
DISGUSTING!,"OK, let me start out by saying I'm extremely biased when it comes to sodas. I grew up with all the delicious teeth-rotting HFCS sodas such as Coke, Dr. Pepper, 7Up, Mountain Dew, and Fanta. And I'm allergic to Aspartame, so artificial sweeteners and I don't usually get along. But I have tried some Stevia-based products before and they weren't too bad, so I thought maybe this would be OK.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. This stuff is now on my list of ""Worst Sodas I've Ever Tasted"", right up there with Russian malt soda and that disgusting No-Cal junk. I had expected a little better than this, but should've known better. If anyone ever comes out with a better Stevia-based soda, let me know. I'm willing to give anything a try at least once."
TastesGrate,"Some one recommended this honey to me so I wanted to give it a try. Honey is known good for immune system, stomach, and skins. Drinking honey lemon water in the morning helps improving skin's condition. This honey is not like the regular honey you see in the supermarket. It has a unique texture and great taste. Dissolve easily in water. I had a cold before and I drank tea with this honey and I felt much better afterwards! Great product!"
Needs more meat,"Soup has a nice flavor, can size is large enough of 2 small bowls. Only down side is there is not much meat in it. This make an easy meal when cooked in oven with a buttermilk bisquit on top."
Requires some getting used to,"I am a fierce lover of peanut butter....I'm talking straight out of the jar on a spoon. So when a coworker brought this in, I decided to give it a try.  My first impression of it was that it was absolutely disgusting.  Doesn't taste a THING like peanut butter (obviously).  The next day at work, I decided to give it another shot, and it was better.  Day 3, one more chance, this time on a sandwich, and it's actually pretty good. Nutritionally, the only difference between this & peanut butter is that this has zero sodium.  Other than that, they're pretty similar. I would definitely buy this.  You just gotta give it a chance."
small - not medium - sized treats,"I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog.  When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium."
"Sometimes, they will gluten you.","I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead."
One of my favorites.,"I susally like Kona or a stronger roast, but this has a good flavor as well.  It is hard to find in K cup variety in regular stores for me, so I am glad I can find it here."
Everlasting treat ball,"There is a definate reason these everlasting treat balls are always sold out of the big local pet food stores- they are fantastic! My dog is a very rough chewer- he can even rip apart kongs, and he loves these treat balls. They don't last him for ""hours"" per say as the package states, but enough time that I am able to have him busy when we have company over. It's especially helpful if you insert a treat ball in both ends of the blue ball, making it especially challenging to pop out the edible discs. Not for an everyday treat obviously, due to quantity and prices, but I will definately buy them again!"
Fever Tree Lite,"Not as much taste and body as the regular Fever Tree tonic when used with gin, but still a marked inprovement to the Schweppes and Canada Dry diet tonics. If you HAVE to have diet then this is the one to get. No after-taste, but not much other taste either!"
No flavor - very weak,I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review.
Superior Coffee,"This coffee is so delicious--very smooth, with hints of mocha. It makes the most amazing cappuccino, too. With cream and sugar, this coffee is simply amazing. I purposely seek coffee shops that sell this brand of coffee because it is so delicious. Anytime I try other brands of coffee, I'm disappointed because it doesn't compare to the Lavazza brand of coffees. Buy it!"
Garden of Good Eating soy corn chips,"I love these chips.  Nice alternative to the regular.  Small size, but sturdy enough for the thickest bean dip. Travel well with minimal breakage in bag."
I will not be making the switch to SWITCH,"This product is carbonated and 100% fruit juice with NO high fructose corn syrup. It has packs 140 calories in a little over 8 oz. of product.<br />I prefer my drinks with 0 calories or just plain water.<br /><br />The taste wasn't pleasing to me and it left an unpleasant aftertaste. Also, the sweetness of the drink made it less than a thirst quencher."
My Cats Love this Food,"I have gradually made the switch to organic foods for myself, but was still feeding my cats non-organic. If the big agriculture business harms the planet making human food, it must do the same making food for our pets.<br /><br />I bought Organix after seeing some good reviews for it. It costs more, but the ingredients are high-quality. I have noticed that my cats need less of it, so the same size bag as conventional food goes farther. My cats also love the taste of this food.<br /><br />Organix is good for my cats and better for our planet.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL7AL6"">Organix Organix Adult and Kitten Dry Cat Food, 14.5-Pound</a>"
Try a Box Before Buying a Case - a review of BTN's Mac & Cheese,"I like organic. We do organic milk and meat, and vegetables when we can afford the latter. My children like macaroni and cheese - not my homemade casserole, of course (lol), but out of a box. (Reasons for this preference are unknown.)<br /><br />In any case, you would think organic *Back to Nature Macaroni & Cheese* would be popular at our house but it's not. Simple put, my children won't eat it.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because of the lack of chemicals that the cheese sauce comes out a little grainy. Or maybe I just made it wrong, but my testy tikes won't gobble this down like non-organic, over-processed wheat Kraft Mac.<br /><br />Two Stars. Maybe I just had a bad box. Or maybe I just didn't make it right that day, but my two (boy and girl) would not eat this macaroni and cheese product. If you are going to try it (products do get IMPROVED every day) then my advice would be to buy ONE box and try it; and not a case."
Terrible,"This was the worst loose tea I have ever had.  I love Stash teabags, English breakfast, but this is bitter and not smooth.save your money"
Unique treat for dogs,"This is the most unique dog treat I've seen. The liquid treat is dispensed from a container that reminds me of a large lip gloss tube with a roller. I've given this unique dog treat ""4 stars"" instead of five as an average based on the varied reactions from my two small dogs. The smaller Malti-poo loved the treat and from his reaction would give it ""5 stars"". He immediately licked the roller, received the treat, and wanted more. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a pickier eater in general and wouldn't even try it at first. He finally did, but didn't seem to like it. We have the chicken flavor and it may be he just didn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Since our Malti-poo likes it so much, I have just ordered the three-pack that has chicken, liver, and bacon flavors. The three-pack is a better value than the individual packs and I'm hoping our Cavalier will like one of the other flavors better than the chicken. This is a unique idea to reward dogs with a treat without filling them up like traditional dog treats.<br /><br />** Update:  I ordered the three-pack and my Cavalier definitely likes the bacon flavor much better than chicken!"
"If your cats like juice, this is the food for them","My cats love the ""sauce"" in the wet food I feed them, and this product is a saucy winner.  Each sack has quite a bit of juice and my cats devour them.  Other wet food products are a lot drier and I have to add water to them in order to get my cats to eat them."
Gluten Free Cornbread Mix,"This product is part of an extensive selection of G-F baking items available from Red Mill. We have been using this product for years, often in combination with diced/minced jalape&ntilde;os or habaneros. Its simply fabulous. And if you have any questions or comments, Red Mill is extremely responsive...."
Excellent snack,I could not get this brand of jerky in local markets. They are delicious and I am glad Amazon carries it.<br />Johnson
Not missing the fat at all!! LOVE IT!,"I bought this as I am trying to cut out some fat & calories in my diet & eat more healthy. I received my order today & decided to give it a try. I warmed my water before mixing up my first taste. WOW, this is really good! I placed it on a banana & I honestly do not miss all the fat! Will buy again & again & again! Sorry, Jiff Healthy Mom's choose PB2!"
Problems caused by summer temperatures,"The seller of York Peppermint patties tried twice to send me their product, but due to circumstances beyond their control, the merchandise arrived in a partially melted condtion.<br />The seller did their best to compensate, but it did not work.<br />They were handsome in their actions to reemburse me, and showed a company policy that I wish would be followed by all the merchants that I do business with, Alas.<br /><br />What actually arrived were partially melted patties, perfectly edible, but not fit to be served to visitors if one had company.  Opening the patties would scatter the chocelate covering, and make a mess.  Once passed the mess, the patties tasted fine.<br /><br />It has been explained to me that taking extra care in the shipping, would make the cost prohibitively expensive.<br /><br />Would like to thank the ""Bice Wholesale"" Company for the efforts they took to send me a satisfactory product.<br />Sorry to say, they were only partially successful.<br />In this particular case, one could honestly blame the summer temperatures, and/or the heatwaves that pestered the Mid West and East Coast recently.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Adam B. Dijkman"
Better than most,"This food is definitely a step above grocery store brands but my dog could not tolerate the grain and had loose stools for 2 months which she also had on royal canin, switched to Orijen puppy food and all Is well"
basic parm,For those wondering what to expect - purchased 5/28/12 through amazon warehouse deals - expiration date on product is 8/5/12. Ok parm for the price.
THEY CHANGED THE ROAST!!!  So DISAPPOINTED!,UGH!  I had just discovered the rich roasted with slight vanilla flavor and then I buy a second bag and was shocked to see the light roast of any cheap flavored coffee.  I called in to their customer service and of course they didn't know what I was talking about.  I love Starbucks for the rich bold roast and now this new version is just like the Dunkin Donat or other flavored water that they pass off as coffee.  I realize they are probably trying to get those customers that like crappy brown water but come on Starbucks remember your BRAND IDENTITY!!!!!
Horizon is not considered organic,"There is a national boycott of Horizon products as they are not organic.  This company was sold to a large conglomerate a few years ago.  Horizon is practicing ""Greenwashing"" - where a company claims to be sustainable, green, and organic but really is not.  Many Co-ops and local health food stores are boycotting Horizon products, including PCC Co-op in Seattle (largest co-op in the country)<br /><br />Please do some research before paying organic prices to a bogus company."
Flavored Herbal Tea,"Nice relaxing fruit tea to enjoy on the porch or at work.  Product is caffeine free.  I purchased on a whim looking at the ingredients: hibiscus, chamomile, rose hips, orange peel, blackberry leaves, sounded great but did not expect fruit flavorings.  I guess I thought it had dried fruit in it?  This tea is good and it makes me sleepy.  The package has a good variety but after sampling all the flavors I don't think that fruit ""flavored"" tea is for me.  I prefer the organic green.  ***UPDATE***  After continuing to drink this tea to use it up, I discovered that it is growing on me.  I think I will purchase again in the future.  Thank you Amazon!!!"
Makes you want to sing!,"This tastes like I remember coffee tasting and has a wonderful aroma.  It comes in a box of 25 single serve pods that you just drop in your cup (the pods are marked with ""this side down"") and add hot water.  Let it steep for a few minutes then remove the pod and enjoy.  One Love is smooth and mild with a nutty coffee flavor.  I keep a box of it at work since each pod is individually sealed in a foil pouch.  That way, when I just can't stand another cup of ""work"" coffee, I brew up a cup of One Love and become the envy of all my friends."
Yummy and fun!  A crowd pleaser!,"Whenever I have guests over, I offer them a glass of Butterfinger cocoa.  They love it!  It really is fantastic!  My local grocer is no longer stocking this so I was SO happy to find it on Amazon!  Great deal!"
Stash Premium Ginger Peach Green Tea with matcha,"I was excited and pleased to be able to purchase the Stash Ginger Peach Green Tea with Matcha from Amazon.  I am in an area where it is difficult to find in the grocery stores.  It is a good price, arrived timely, fresh, and flavorful.  I will be ordering it again from Amazon without any hesitation."
Good flavor,"Mom and I enjoyed this coffee very well and I wanted to get more, even monthly, but the price is ridiculous now! That is so sad for me."
What can I say?,"It's a coffee k cup holder, a little big for desk space, but I mainly use it in a drawer on top of books. What else can I say? It's a k cup rack."
my first vegan love,"this cookie opened my mind to being vegan & eating deliciously. this cookie is the best choc chip i've ever had with the perfect balance of chocolate and nuts and a grainy but delicious cookie. this was my ""gateway cookie"" to her others- which are also very good, like the Lemon. but i think choc chip is my fave. yum."
Great morning tea,This is one of the better Irish Breakfast teas I have tried.  I will keep buying it as long as it is offered!  The packaging does a good job keeping the tea fresh.
wonderful tea,"my favorite tea, perfect flavor and taste. I have 7+ different tea flavors and several brands always on hand and this is always the empty box."
"great product , but new price is horrible","great product , but new price is horrible<br />2 years ago was $25 for 24 cans<br />few months ago was $28<br />now is almost double, what is going on?"
Lakewood PURE Black Cherry Juice,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LO37PY"">Lakewood PURE Black Cherry Juice, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br />This is some of the best cherry juice that you can imagine. Very slightly tart but sweet-not cloyingly so and packed to perfection for Amazon buyers that love a good, natural juice."
Best Chinese Meal,"We love Wanchai Ferry's Orange Chicken. I refuse to order chicken from a Chinese restuarant, so this is great. It also feeds the whole family for the price of one entree at a restuarant. We add our own broccoli crowns and sometimes water chestnuts. The delivery is regular and well packaged. Thanks Amazon!"
clear jel,I use this to make pie filling for canning. It holds the filling together from the day I can it to the day i use a jar. great stuff
Kettle Bakes are my #1 favorite potato chip.,If you are craving Potato Chips and Dieting this is one to check out..They are better then traditional Potato Chips.  3grams fat per serving..it is remarkable..Try them and you will love them.
Never Again,"I bought this food hoping to add a little variety to my cat's diet.  He's been on Felidae and Evo since I took him home.  I hoped this would be a good alternative high protein brand.  I won't be coming back.  When I opened the bag I was surprised to find that while there were some full pieces of food, most of the kibble had fallen apart into a fine dust. After a few weeks of eating this half powder/half round kibble bits diet my cat began to develop acne on his chin from having to rub his little chin in the dusty bits of food.  He hated the food so much he would go pry open the door of the closet where his other foods were kept and rummage through the other bags of food.  He also appeared to have some kind of an allergic reaction to the food which manifested in vigorous licking of his front paws until they were raw.  Poor guy. I understand every cat is different, but I was extremely disappointed by this crumby (pun intended) food."
Irish porridge,"I just ate my first bowl of Irish porridge, as the can refers to it. It was chewy, nutty, dense, filling and delicious, just like all the reviews said it would be. It was easy to cook, the directions on the can advise to boil 4 cups of water and then add 1 cup of oatmeal. Simmer for 30 minutes exactly and it turns out perfect and serves 4, with 150 calories per serving. Each can contains 20 servings. Storing 4 cans was not an issue, considering each 28 ounce can is about as big as a quart of paint. My only gripe is that all the cans I received are badly dented, but if that's the trade off for the bargain price and convenience of purchasing from Amazon, I can deal with it."
trident cinnamon gum,I wasnt happy with this item because the expiration date on the gum was Feb 2008.  So basically it was out of date already.
The only Canned Tuna i eat.,"This is the only canned tuna i will eat. packed in olive oil, nothing else comes close."
Where's the jazz?,I found this coffee to be very blah and boring. I gave away most of the box and would not order it again. I greatly prefer Newman's Own Organic Decaf.
Very fishy...too fishy,"So fishy that our cat is all over this the moment I cut the packaging open.  The smell is very strong.  My baby did not take to it.  It is our cat's food now.<br /><br />Their other products are much better, but this one is way too fishy.  It doesn't smell pleasant when you go out to a friend's house or restaurant.  If I just wipe the spoon and bowl without washing after feeding this and put it back in the backpack, after I get home the whole thing reeks."
sweet,delicious delicious! delicious delicious! Fast shipment and I think it was a great chance for me to try German candy.
Good compromise protein supplement,"I am a very picky eater which seriously limits my protein intake.  My trainer, yoga instructor, and physician both recommend that I start drinking a protein nutrition drink.  Of course, being a purist perfectionist I set out on a quest to find the ""best"" drink on the market.  I literally tried everything, including every powder mix.  Oh, I also forgot to mention that I am a ""super taster"" (lucky me).  I have long since deduced that when looking for nutrition bars or meal replacements, go straight to the brands that have been making unhealthy options first.  They know what they are doing when it comes to making something taste good.  Take EAS nutrition bars versus Snickers nutrition bars.  Snickers is in the good taste business and they know how to engineer a tasty treat.  For them it is taste first then nutrition chemistry, whereas EAS is chemistry first and taste second.  EAS nutrition bars don't even need to be taken out of their packaging to be eaten, since there would be no noticeable difference in taste.  Same for this drink, Carnation has been making Instant B'fast forever (at least since the Stone Age when I was a kid) and they know what tastes good.  Regardless of the stats, what makes this drink the winner of my taste quest is that it really tastes like chocolate milk.  Just to mention a few items, it has ""no sugar added"" which means that it only has the natural milk sugars...it is NOT sugar free.  It is a reasonable 150 calories, whereas most protein drinks are well over 200 (which is a plus for those watching their calories).  The bonus is that it provides 13 grams of protein, which makes it competitive with the other drinks on the market."
it works,Bought an assortment of different traps for moths and this was the only one working instantly. Other traps are still empty and in the same room as Safer Clothes Moth traps.
Fantastic!,This sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc.  It has just enough heat to make everything taste better.
Yummy gluten-free breakfast cereal,"This cereal is delicious! I used to eat steel-cut oatmeal, but my doctor put me on a gluten-free diet. This is a wonderful substitution for my steel-cut oatmeal. In fact, I like this cereal better than steel-cut oatmeal.<br /><br />Like most people, I don't have a lot of time in the morning to cook breakfast during the week. So, I make a big pot of this cereal on the weekend and store the leftovers in the refrigerator. I add a little vanilla after the cereal has been cooked. Bourbon vanilla compliments this cereal well.<br /><br />I reheat the cereal in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes. Then, I sprinkle on a little cinnamon and add a sliced banana. It fills me up. Also, this cereal is tasty plain."
Energy Boost,I LOVE these Larabars!  I eat one just before my morning trip to the gym and feel energized.
Still Excellent,"I purchased these on a Gold Box Sale, probably like the other reviewers so far. This ground coffee is vacuum packed like a brick; similar to many brands. Date code showed June 09 (a year ago) and exp 12/10, which may be too long, but that may also be why it went on sale. Me and a friend both enjoyed the taste and I would rate it excellent. Not stale at all. Normally, to make coffee taste good, I add sugar and creamer, or coconut cream and rice bran solubles, to avoid dairy and gain nutritional benefits. This coffee was very good black. I will try their other varieties. I'll try their whole beans and grind them myself next time."
Has a cinnamon like flavor,"This coffee has a little cinnamon flavor. If you are not a big fan of cinnamon flavor, stay away...<br />I wouldn't have bought it if I knew."
Cheaper at WallMart,"a 6 pack at wallmart is $3.99.  if you buy 4, you would have 24 8oz cans, giving you 192 ounces at $15.96.  Amazon is ripping you off!"
The Only One Ganoderma Coffee,"I didn't enjoy the flavor of this brand of Ganderma coffee. I saw this and thought I'd give it a try. However, my best friend tried it & loved it, so she took it all home with her to drink. She thought it tasted like a cappuccino. I started with Gano Excel Ganoderma coffee, but the price was too high. Now, I use the Diamond brand which is just as good, at less than half of the cost."
Good price,I now will never run out of food for my cats.  They both love it every time and I love the price.
Solid Gold Tiny Tots Treats,My Yorkie Roxy is crazy for these treats. I can't always get them here where I live so I bought them through Amazon -- very fast delivery -- I will in the future do the same
Not very good,"I should preface this by saying that I am not a coffee snob.  I used to drink instant coffee and have only recently begun making ""real"" coffee in a drip machine.  I decided to try a couple different types to see what I liked.  My dislike of this Starbucks variety might be exacerbated by the fact that the coffee I tried just before this one (Lavazza Qualita Rossa) was so good.  In comparison, this blend has a very harsh and bitter taste.  I won't be buying this again and wish I hadn't purchased a three-pack."
Not as fresh as I had hoped,"I was surprised when I opened the first box of these Piroulines. They were not that CRISP CRUNCHY cookie I had anticipated. They are all wrapped up very well and sealed shut but still act as though they are stale. Sorry.The ones I bought at the grocery store were PERFECT!! so, I don't know what happened. I'll try again when they have more."
Nothing special,"Maybe it is because this chocolate only contains 54 % cocoa (vs. let's say the 70 % Lindt) but I found the taste disappointing. This might be premium chocolate, and it might be organic and Rainforest Alliance-certified. But the flavor still is surprisingly bland and cheap - a tad too sweet and creamy, with a bit of a waxy texture in too thick a bar. This is just a run-of-the-mill dark chocolate and nothing to entice the palate with."
Wonderful,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
good for latte,I don't care for this as typical tea brewed in water but steep it in hot milk and it's wonderful!
"Good water, bottles are rather large","The water tastes like every other bottled water. I have no idea whether the PH of the water makes any real difference. I did not realize these bottles were going to be so huge (over 50 ounces), so it was a struggle getting them up the stairs. It also makes them somewhat bulky to use. The price seems expensive, but when you consider that these bottles are over twice the size of most bottled waters, it is reasonable."
A Must Have Baby Item,"I'm a stay-at-home mom with an almost 7 month old.  I got the Babycook as a Christmas gift on recommendation from a coworker of my husband's.  In recent months, this has become my favorite baby item!<br /><br />I'm not a health nut.  I don't have a problem paying for convenience.  But, we figured over the course of a couple kids, this would save us money and would ultimately be healthier.  Little did I know!  It is so simple to use.  Although, the included directions stink and you need to watch a youtube video on it to understand.  But that only takes 3 minutes.  It is so simple to clean.  I was worried about this, but as soon as I've dished out my puree, I rinse the parts.  Then I can either wash right away or leave for when I finish the rest of the dishes.  If I'm making several batches in a row, I rinse and reuse.<br /><br />So the real kicker for me was when my larger-than-average son wasn't interested in solids.  I thought rather than using my Babycook, I'd just buy a couple of jars to start with to see what he liked.  He hated it all.  I wasted so much jar food because once opened it only lasts a day or two.  Then I decided just to whip up whatever fruits and veggies we had in the fridge with my Babycook.  I started with pears and carrots.  He loved both!  I'd even tried both from the jar and he had refused.  The taste difference is very distinct because of the freshness.<br /><br />I also love that I can choose the portion without wasting any of the food.  After I make a batch of whatever in my Babycook, I freeze the puree in classic Rubbermaid ice cube trays.  Once they are frozen, I pop them out and store them in plastic bags in the freezer.  Each ice cube is about an ounce, whereas jarred food is often in 4oz tubs.  My son doesn't even come close to eating 4 ounces at a sitting yet.  So I only thaw what I know he can eat.<br /><br />Making a batch doesn't take long, but I also love that it doesn't confine me to the kitchen.  If I start a batch steaming and then get pulled away to my child, the machine shuts off when it's ready and waits for me to come back.  No problem.  I tend to do a couple batches at once, and then go several weeks without needing to make any more.  For scale, one sweet potato made about 22oz of food and a pear made about 10oz.  Considering the sweet potato cost me about 80cents, I figured the savings was pretty decent.<br /><br />I'm very glad my husband's coworker suggested this, because I would have never considered making my own baby food.  Now I love it.  And I honestly believe if I can do it, anyone can."
Yummy tea,"I love this tea.. It was recomended to me by my Dr. to help during pregnancy.. Doesn't taste too bad with some honey, and makes me feel more relaxed."
Bad best by date!,"The item  was a gift and hasn't been used yet.  The recipient noticed that the best by date on the bottom says August 2011, I purchased it in November 2011.  It was pretty embarrassing to say the least.  I don't plan on returning it because it would have to be shipped from Virginia to Connecticut and back to the sellar.  Because of that I will never purchase anything from this seller again."
Excellent for what it is,"I used to eat a lot of this when I first ""discovered"" the pleasure of oatmeal about a year ago. Now, I make my own using Quaker's ""Old Fashioned Oats,"" (or Target's cheaper equivalent), which takes only 10 minutes or so, allows me to control the sweetness to my liking by adding the maple syrup and brown sugar myself, and doesn't give me any ""artificial flavors"" or ""guar gum,"" or ""caramel color.""<br /><br />Given that, I will say that, for an instant product, this is pretty good, though just a bit too sweet for me. Its first ingredient is Whole Grain Rolled Oats (although the second is sugar) and it does have a reasonably creamy consistency which you would expect from oatmeal. I actually preferred Quaker's high fiber variation of this product, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MWASW6"">Quaker Instant Oatmeal, High Fiber, Maple Brown Sugar, 12.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. I think that one is a little less sweet than this one and the 10 grams of fiber is an attraction if you're trying (like I am) to get more fiber into your diet.<br /><br />It's absurd to compare this to ""old fashioned"" or ""steel cut"" oatmeal. This is a convenience product that requires no preparation and which you would use when you don't have the time or inclination to fuss with the others. It should be evaluated (and consumed) with this in mind."
They taste okay--my Daughters like them.,"I just tasted one for the first time tonight and I thought it tasted pretty good. My 6 and 3 1/2 year old daughters really like them. So, to put it simply, good nutrition, good taste, I think we'll be buying more. I'm sure my youngest would give it a 5, but it's not quite a knock-it-out-of-the-park taste for me, so I feel more honest giving it a 4."
Wonderful Product & Taste! Best Sugar Replacement!,"I absolutely love this product.  It taste wonderful and there is no after taste.  It taste great in coffee, tea,cooking or any other form that you normally would use regular sugar.  It is most better for you then sugar.  It is natural and does not cause spikes in your glucose level.  It is safe for diabetics."
My puppy was addicted after 1,"I just got a new puppy (chihuahua) and at 7 1/2 weeks, I gave him one. After that one, he wanted more. Although he is really tiny at just over 2.1 lbs, he had no problems eating a whole one, although I usually break it in 1/2. They are ideal for small dogs and puppies."
Good Stuff,"I've been using this product for years.  It's chocked full o' vitamins and minerals, tastes great, and is easy to prepare.  Makes a great ""enhancer"" for unflavored whey protein too."
Kashi is Great!,"Kashi Go Lean Crunch is the best cold cereal I've even eaten.  Besides, it's actually good for you."
Tastes Great But Is It Really Good For You?,A friend of mine gave me a couple triple chocolate bars to try out. They were very tastey and I was going to buy a box until I noticed they contain partially hydrogenated soybean oil which I stay away from.
Just like I  remember,"This is just like I remember as a youngster living in New England. If you like hot dogs and beans, this will be a good addition."
Excellent and tasty preserves,"I purchased this a while back from either Home Goods or a speciality store.  What made me purchase this jar of preserves is that the contents were not liquidity like some are.  I also love cherries.  Besides being full-bodied, these Michigan Black Cherry Preserves are delicious and fresh tasting.  They also spread easily as I was using this for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br /><br />What is even more impressive is that I got a call from one of the owners of the company when I wrote them about having trouble opening the jar. This fellow Dan (two days before Christmas) called me back within 30 minutes of my sending the email.  The label on the jars from Home Goods (where he thinks I purchased this) don't have the ""how to open"" instructions on them so I had spent about 15 minutes trying to get the jar open but couldn't.  After he directed me to the FAQ on the website and gave me an idea over the phone of how this opened, I was able to reassemble the wires and opened it within seconds.  It's a French canning jar that opens differently than what we are use to here in America.<br /><br />So not only did I get a great jar of preserves but it came with OUTSTANDING customer service!"
Coffee review,This coffee is great! It is strong and bold.  If you enjoy a stronger and bolder tasting coffee then I recommend this product.
Rich & Delicious,"My husband and I have been enjoying Trader Joe's Grade B Maple Syrup for years, and the Coombs Family Farms Grade B is equally good and darker, with perhaps an even deeper, richer flavor!  Anyone who appreciates a true maple flavor will love this syrup."
3 for chicken& brown rice- 0 for beef flavor,"Both of my cats like the chicken & brown rice and Newman's dry food flavors which I buy when they are heavily discounted. Neither of them would touch the beef flavor I bought on a gold box special. It has a faded milky slightly greenish pale brown hue, not medium brown as one would expect and oddly not much of an odor (I know why complain about that, but my point is is should have some type of aroma or odor to it.) Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice. I like Organix and By Nature ingredients and my cats do too. Sometimes I'll buy Natural Value or Natural Balance canned foods since they offer more variety of flavors."
A good deal,This is really a good deal if you do the subscribe and save.  I would normally pay almost twice as much if I purchased this product at the health foods store.
LOVE THEM,These apples are the best!! The family and friends love them!!<br />They arrived fresh and sooner then expected!!I will order again. They make great gifts too!!
Great taste.,"This tastes great.  I love peanut butter, but not all the fat.  I mix this with my protein shake and it tastes great."
Smooth and Flavoricious,"Really like this coffee. At this price point, it might be the best coffee you can get on Amazon or almost anywhere. I mean, look at the price per ounce...so cheap. If you love a good cup o' joe, and it's so much a part of your life that you realize you need to save a few bucks, because you're drinking up too much money and your love for coffee is such that you're OK with something less than the very best, then this coffee is my go-to recommendation for you. If you're made of cash, there's a very famous local roaster who will knock your socks off starting at $1.70/oz. There are local roasters everywhere who will give you an awesome bag of beans for about $1/oz. But for less than 30 cents/oz, you can get some perfectly good Kronung and be satisfied each morning, while also saving some figurative beans.<br /><br />I think the flavor is that Northern European mellow coffee taste (think Ikea coffee), but stronger and more flavorful, while still maintaining a low level of acidity. If you like your coffee with a bit of bite or sting, then this is not for you. My other cheap coffee alternatives are the 8 O'Clock Columbian and the Yuban dark, but this Kronung, at least right now, beats both. I use an Aeropress, a Delonghi espresso machine, and a Bunn or Cuisinart drip. Honestly, I say skip those occasional sales on big name brands. If you're cost-conscious enough to perk up to a sale, then know that even after the discount, they're still not better tasting nor cheaper than this Kronung."
my son loves it,he loves the flavor..i tried one from the market to make sure he likes it.i get it on amazon now..its good price and alwasy have them on the go...they are great
Grove Square Sugar Free Hot Cider Cups,"Disgusting!  I have never tasted anything more awful.  I went along with the other reviews and thought that I would try this product.  I have tried other products from this maker and enjoyed everything.  However, this apple cider smelled and tasted awful.  So if anyone is considering this item, think twice before you buy."
used to be better,"We used to buy this brand all the time. Our kitties loved it. I'm not sure if the company changed the formula or product or what, because the last few boxes were clearly not the same. At first growth was sparse, one box I exchanged at the store after noticing weevils in it, and the last two boxes, we grew only mold instead of grass. The first I was willing to chalk it off to a bad batch, but after the last box, that's too many times I've been burned and wasted money on this brand. No more. We are trying other sources of grass. So far, our kitties seem to like those just as much."
GM CFT Golden French Toast,This selection from Green Mountain is so far our favorite.  The breakfast time aroma of real french toast with a hearty taste in a full bodied coffee.  We can't keep it around - too popular.  It is also very hard to find.  Amazon has come through for us .... can't find it any other place.
Good Stuff,"I cook alot and use lot of herbs, spices and pepper. This is a great value and has tons of flava!!!<br /><br />Don't hesitate to purchase."
WOW! Fantastic!!!,"I received my first order a few days ago... originally bought it in the smaller, 15 oz size, thinking that I would mostly use it topically. But then I read in one of the reviews that it is great on popcorn, and decided to give it a try. It was delicious! I found myself licking the spoon- it's really true, what others have stated- the flavor is clean and fresh. Amazing! Since then, we have had it in eggs, and toast, anywhere we can... Try it in your fried potatoes- simply delicious. My dog even gets some in her food too- she loves it, and it's great for her coat!<br /><br />Of course, the way it feels on the skin is simply fantastic. A note about the ""smell"": to my nose, it does have a faint coconut odor that fades once it is applied to the skin- it is not the overwhelming- and probably synthetic- aroma that comes from sun tan lotions, or ""Skin Trip"" Lotion (for those of you familiar with it.<br /><br />As for the flavor it lends to food, I find it to be subtle, not overwhelming at all. I can't think of any foods off hand that I would not use it in- and trust me, I know my way around the kitchen... I am sure it would be delicious in baked goods as well.<br /><br />Finally, it has been mentioned in other reviews before, but I think it bears repeating: I ordered my first shipment in January. Since the melting point for this product is (I think it was) 74 degrees, it is worth noting that if you live in a hot climate, and your order is placed during summer months, I can see that there might be a higher risk of product leakage. I will definately factor that in when it comes to re-ordering.<br /><br />Oh, and speaking of re-ordering, I guess I do have one more thing to add: If you are considering which size to get, consider: I ordered the 15 oz (x2) pack, and realized that I will need to order a MUCH larger size next time, as I will be using this for cooking and lotion, etc. If you are just planning to use topically, then I am sure that the 15oz size will be perfect to start!<br /><br />Enjoy! We are thrilled with this product, and will order again soon!"
Pumpkin Seeds,"These Pumpkin Seeds are the quality I have grown to expect from Bob's products. This is the best price I have been able to find on pumpkin seeds and enjoy them on a daily basis, especially in the morning with oatmeal."
WAIT.....DO NOT DO IT...,"OKAY HOW SHOULD I SAY THIS, IT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE CREAM CHEESE...<br />IT HAS A WEIRD ALMOST CHEMICAL TASTE TO IT, I EVEN STORED IT IN THE FRIG TO KEEP IT FRESH, IT DID NOT HELP...<br />THING IS I HAD USED IT BEFORE YEARS AGO AND I HAD THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT THEN...<br />MAYBE I GOT A BAD BATCH OR MAYBE THEY CHANGED HOW IT BEING MADE NOW..<br />I KNOW I WON'T BE BUYING IT AGAIN.............."
Disappointed,"As much as I wanted to like this, I just couldn't. The oatmeal was very slimy.  You can save yourself about $30 and buy something at your local super market such as Bob's red mill."
"Delicious, but over $10????","THese cost about $3 at TJs...  How could they charge over $10?  THey are delicious, my daughters' favorite. They are crunchy and sweet and very light."
Exotic Berry!!!!!!,"I have loved this gum since the first time I tried it!!!  The cardamom in it reminded me of my grandmother's hot cross buns....it is a different spice, but I am glad you found it and used it in this gum....If I could I would buy cases and cases of it!"
Greenies,"You cant go wrong with greenies! My dogs love them and go nuts on them. Only downside to this is that its so soft it gets chewed up quickly so i dont quite see how this will improve the dogs teeth and gums.<br /><br />Amazon has the best prices by far and with no tax + amazon prime, this by far, becomes the cheapest place to buy products."
Solestra,This is the same product sold in the 'brick and mortar' stores for much more $$$$. I keep it on auto-buy. It tastes and works the same and the customer service has been stellar!!!! Thanks!
DELICIOUS!,"Mild, but not boring! Enough sweetness for most, but I still add stevia. I have given several bags away and everybody raves about it!"
My go to poop bags for my dogs,"I have been ordering these bags from amazon for a couple of years now, and they are my preferred choice. Compared to other bags I have used in the past the perforated edges make them easy to tear off and even more importantly they are easy to open. Also the side that opens is clearly marked. These points are important when walking two energetic dogs who can get excited so I like to be able to get the bags out and open and the poop scooped up as quickly as possible."
"Novel snack, tasty, but...","I got hooked on candy-coated fennel seeds when I first tried them through a purchase I made with an online Indian cooking supply store. They were delicate and delish and addictive. I finished them up and then I bought theses packages of fennel seeds to stock up, also from India.  They are good, but apparently all sugar-coated fennel seeds are not created equally. The candy coating on these is much thicker and because of this, they are like little rocks to chew on, VERY crunchy, borderline ""hard"" crunchy. You can visually see the difference in the size of the individual seeds from the two different purchases; it's not my imagination. It isn't helping me any that I am going thru costly dental issues for the past year, so I am more sensitive now than ever about what I'm chewing on. The packaging is very nice, though; they have very user-friendly, slide-lock tops, very secure, nothing will come out. I was impressed with that.  When it's time to replenish these, however, as I eventually will, I will seek out the ones that I tried first and preferred. I will use these as little giftables since I have five bags of them left!"
"IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Apple","I love all of the izze flavors so far, but this has to be the best.  It tastes just like the Tootsie roll caramel apple suckers you find at halloween. [...]<br />Its so amazing how this tastes, and its not overly sweet, and you can actually tell the flavor that you are drinking unlike some other flavored things that taste nothing like what you would expect.  Like one of the other reviewers said, it tastes like drinking a crips granny smith apple, just amazing."
The best yet!,"These are the best organic oatmeal cookies I've been able to find.  I've been getting Mrs. Denson's for years, but they have raisins, without which I can do, and they're very good when they're not too crisp.  But I just saw these at Amazon, and decided to take a chance and give them a try.  I'm delighted with them.  They really are soft, not crunchy, they don't have any raisins, and they're packaged in individual sealed packets.  I've got a new standard cookie!"
Nice conditioner,Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner is a nice product. My hair tends to be dry with some breakage. This product makes my hair feel great. It has a subtle nice fragrance.<br />It is made in the USA which a plus to me since I have gotten products made in China that I don't care for. Also the ingredients list is better than some products I have used...no sodium lauryl sulphate.<br />It does seem to help nourish my hair. Like this product very much.
not great,This tea has a good price/bag but for some reason doesn't have a great or even very strong flavor.
Magical Ganoderma!!,"I had a baby 4 months ago and always tired sleepy and cranky!! Been drinking this tea for one week and my back pain and headache is gone!!! I have more energy and never tired anymore. When I was younger I've always heard of ganoderma but never had a chance to try it. Back in the days ganoderma was very rare and expensive!! People think $40/box is expensive??? Growing up my parents drink it sometimes and one box cost thousands!!!!<br />This product is now available to us for cheap, I can't wait to drink my tea everyday!<br />Oh btw one teabag makes 3 cups, I use 3 teabags in a pitcher and put in fridge. Lasts me 3-4 days"
Great Product,This is one of the brans that makes a great tasting product and can be used in alcoholic on non-alcoholic beverages to good effect. Personally I like to make flavored Vodka Martinis.
"Bright flavor, devine aroma!","This has easily become our favorite flavored coffee! From the moment it begins brewing, sharing a whiff of the tropics to the last sip in the cup it delights the senses! I usually save flavored coffees for an afternoon treat but this one makes it into my morning routine often as well!"
Delicious,"I bought this for the excellent price for a large amount of almonds, and it exceeded expectations. These are delicious almonds."
Awesome Coffee,I love this coffee. Great taste and great way to start your morning. If you like flavored coffee you will like this.
Some bags crunchy others not so much...,"We just ordered the ""Very Berry"" and the ""Tropical Fruit"" arrived in the same box.<br /><br />Berry - The first bag was no good, not crunchy at all. Almost tasted stale. Very broken up pieces. The next couple seem to be ok though.<br />Tropical - We loved! They were crunchy. Also these fruit pieces were a nice size, didn't get pulverized in shipping."
"Totally the best of the lower-carb, higher fiber pastas--tastes like regular, but doesn't give me the sleepies","I've been using Dreamfields pasta for about a year and a half now. It's become a kitchen staple for us. I bought it to help keep my sugar under control while still enjoying pasta dishes. My husband, a very finicky eater, didn't even notice it was high-fiber (well, until he got a bit gassy later). Tastewise, this is just as good as regular, quality pasta. (And not gritty like whole wheat ones can be.)<br /><br />A very nice product, and a boon to those watching their sugar numbers. I'll add that I don't get the super-sleepiness after eating this pasta that I used to eating regular pasta (you know, that post-carb napping syndrome).<br /><br />I've used the penne, the linguine, the elbow (for mac'n'cheese and in soups) and the lasagna (for veggie and regular lasagne casseroles). Great. All of them.<br /><br />Thumbs up."
Excellent Yumminess!,These K Cups are a great value and the taste is fabulous. Very sweet and rich. Tastes best on the largest water setting of machine. Yum!
blueberry waffle mix,"I have gotten the blueberry, along with the strawberry, chocolate and the cinnamon spice. The blueberry is my family's favorite. They like them even more when I add dried blueberries to the mix. Scrumptious!!! A close second is the cinnamon spice with a peach topping that I make. I need to order the blueberry again, and with all the recomendations, the vanilla.<br />THANK YOU HEARTLAND AND AMAZON!!!"
Excellent Product,I use McCann steel cut Oat Meal as a soaker for natural artisan sourdough breads (Maple Oatmeal Bread) and it adds terrific flavor and texture to the loaves.  The product also makes a great breakfast cereal.
Market spice tea bags,"I have liked Market spice tea for years. It seems to be best when made with loose tea in a whole potful. But sometimes when I want just a cupful, I used to try using one of those mesh tea balls or spoon things but it never got strong enough. And the stronger it is, the sweeter it is and I like it sweeter! Then I tried the tea bags and if I have the patience to let it sit a bit, I get a good, sweet cup of Market spice tea!"
"crunchy, tasty, wholesome","A marvelous crunchy treat, acceptable to even the most finicky toddler. Wonderful with salsa and sour cream, hot spinach and artichoke dip, and many more ways. If they used a different fat to cook them (the label currently says safflower and/or canola) they would be perfect. I love that they're free of GMO but I'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil, or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement."
Not so great...,"I was so disappointed in this chocolate syrup!  Had burnt sugar overtones, and VERY little chocolate flavor. To try to make chocolate milk taste at all chocolaty it became WAY too sweet... ughh.  I will have to keep searching for a good chocolate syrup, or face up to doing it homemade.  Hope the manufacturers take note!"
yummy but....,"My dogs love these but they make them very gassey.  So if you don't mind clearing the room 20 mins after they eat them, they are great for training because of the small size."
Nice Body Wash,"I really liked this product.  First of all the size is much bigger than most body washes I have purchased.  I really liked that the cap was on the bottom and flat, it makes it easy to store, and reduces product waste.  The smell is a nice musk, and not strong at all, very pleasant.  The scrubbing particles are smaller than most body washes I have used, but still too big to be very useful.  To exfoliate well, they really need to be about the size of sand.  The product does clean well, and is very pleasant."
Easy way to make Lo Mein,"I love Chicken or Beef Lo Mein, and always buy it at Chinese restaurants, but wanted to be able to make it at home.  Using Lee Kum Kee Panda Brand Lo Mein Oyster Sauce has solved this problem.  It is so good and so easy to make.  I use linguini noodles, frozen vegetables, and either chicken or beef.  I cook them first then combine them and mix in the Lee Kum oyster sauce and yum yum.  Believe it really is almost as good as the restaurants.  I love this stuff!"
You need this!,"Forgive my lack of eloquence here but I'm just so dang excited to see The Shizzle (voodoo hot, and the standard) here on Amazon!  its a delicious marinade or use it as a grilling sauce, I love it on chicken (legs, thighs, breasts, wings, whole) or marinade shrimp, fish, pork, burgers, steak... you name it, the shizzle adds a unique, better-than-traditional jerk flavor to whatever you're cooking or grilling.  if you like heat, the voodoo hot version has more habanero than the original but its not going to kill your mouth, you can still get all the great flavor, but with a little extra party on your tongue.  go to their website for some delicious recipes, my two favs are ""Shizzled Shrimp and Grits"" and the wife and I love shizzled grilled chicken over pineapple coconut rice... its a HUGE hit whenever we entertain... just order this sauce. you won't be disappointed!"
Pam's Choc. Chunk Cookies SCRUMPTIOUS!,"Although I can't make myself eat Pam's chocolate chip cookies (tasteless), these dark chocolate, chocolate chunk cookies are so delicious that I prefer them to other ready-made cookies on the market. And I'm no longer on a gluten-free diet, but still buy them whenever I can and gifted these to my sister and niece who were wowed by them, big time. If you're a chocolate lover at all, these cookies are super chocolatey and satisfying to that great craving. And they're healthy - a big plus for me. And the price at Amazon is terrific. Enjoy!"
An interesting new ingredient,"This is an ingredient best substituted for lemon juice, but with a different flavor:sour grapes. I used it in dessert bars;subtle difference, but good. Also salad dressings, light sauces for chicken or fish. also quite good. Stars were lost because it came packed in styro peanuts, the bane of our existence. But the product itself is just fine."
Great Olive Oil,"I'll start off with the disclaimer that neither my husband nor I are any kind of trained chef, but we do have a decent idea of what tastes good (at least to us). This olive oil is much better than anything we've used before, which is generally bought at the grocery store. Since buying it, we have made some very yummy dressings and it's great over pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil and cheese. It has a much lighter taste to it than what I'm used to as well as having a lovely nutty smell when it is heated. Lastly, we mostly decided on this product based on the price for the two tins and I think we ended up with a great item for not too much money!"
no fuss,"We love tea, and my husband can make his own tea with no cleanup this way! Always fresh tasting, too."
Good and so very close to loose leaf chinese green tea.,"I became accustomed to chinese green tea while on vacation to China. Drinking fresh loose leaf tea everyday was a pure pleasure so I even went to the extent of buying chinese green teas being imported. Then one day at work, I had run out and I found we had Tazo China Green Tips tea. Lo and behold, it has the same flavor, essence and aroma as the tea I had been drinking in China. The flavor is good and the tea bag seeps well, it's not as bold as the loose leaf version by Tazo sold in tins but it does the job and for the price on the bulk 6 pack of 24, it's a pretty good deal.  I buy the loose leaf version of the Tazo China Green Tips at Starbucks for under 7 dollars a box, which are actually tins. Love this tea for the convenience and being so close to loose leaf versions of the tea. As the other reviewer noted, don't seep too long otherwise it gets bitter. I like the perfect seep where it has the nutty undertones, fresh aromatic vapors. Conveniently on Amazon for a 6 pack of 24."
good for grain sensitive dogs,my dog seems to be grain sensitive.<br />he had dirrahea til i switched him to taste of the wild food and stopped giving treats that had grain in it<br />so i stick to this treat only.<br />he hasn't had dirrahea yet.<br /><br />its small - so its great cuz i don't want a fat dog<br /><br />the on;y bad thing is that - you need to keep it airtight - or it will become really hard.<br />i have a airtight canister cuz it was a pain always opening/closing the bag everytime.<br /><br />he seems to like it alot
Really good STRONG coffee,"We like our coffee dark and this one handles the job. Even when using the 12oz. setting on the coffee maker, this stuff is thick. If you like strong coffee, you can't go wrong with this one."
Sadly Disappointed,"After reading the previous reviews I had high hopes for this product.  Unfortunately it fell way short.  I knew it would be foamy upon mixing and that it would be better aftering sitting in the fridge over night.  But even after contant mixing and being refridgerated for a couple days I can still taste a chalkiness in the tea which is just terribly off-putting.  I'll try to make some more and see if it gets better, but when compared to properly brewed-fresh tea, it's not even close.  I like a nice crisp taste to my tea, not the chalky after taste this gives."
Omaha Steaks 8 (12 oz.) Private Reserve Ribeyes,"Well, Grandpa made out like a king this Christmas.  Grandma bought him some Omaha Steaks (12 oz. ribeyes) and I must tell you that they are delicious!  Gramps shared his steaks with Grams and we had a delightful dinner.  There are six more for him to enjoy and there's not a piece of fat anywhere on them.  They cook even better on the George Foreman grill that went with them as a second gift (also purchased through Amazon.com -- thank you).  It's so easy to clean and he was like a little kid waiting for Santa to finally bring the gifts this year.  Of course, I made out like a bandit this year also, so now we're both flat broke.<br /><br />Who cares?  We have our health, our children and grandchildren, and we have each other for the past 44 years.  Who could ask for anything more?  Thanks to Amazon.com for making our Christmases so special!!"
Beware!,"I opened a bag of these and poured them into a bowl. One of the chips on top had something black on it. It looked like black tar or melted black crayon. I assumed it was a contaminant of some sort, since it didn't resemble any kind of food ingredient. I wish I had not bought these chips. I am now wary of all Kettle products."
One Love Better Than It Smells,"One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost ""muddy"" odor. By ""muddy,"" I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you're looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone. A nice organic blend."
Please disregard my last review.  I miscounted.,I wrote an earlier review on my product arriving and there were missing boxes.  It was all wrapped in shrink wrap and I miscounted thinking that there were only 12 of the 24 boxes.  I miscounted and all of the boxes are there.  The shipping was very quick and the company looked into this matter and responded on the next business day.  The company is great to deal with.  I feel terrible for giving them a negative feedback due to my mistake.
A true 'light' agave nectar.,"After ordering other so called 'light' agave nectars which were much darker and added an unpleasant taste to the Mararitas I make using only fresh lime juice, Tequila and light agave nectar; it is a pleasure to receive a high quality product!"
"One of the best ""jams"" I have ever tasted","We all remember the Saturday Night Live bit - ""With a name like Sumcker's, it has to be good..."" But in reality, they really do make wonderful products. My wife is really partial to cherry jellies and jams so when I saw their ""Orchard's Finest"" Michigan red Tart Cherry Preserves, I decided to be a home hero and surprise her with a jar. I didn't make a big deal about it. I just presented her with a Thomas's English Muffin (my favorite - even better - for me - than the much praised wolferman's english muffins) with the cherry preserves lovingly applied. Just like Igor in Young Frankenstein, she made yummy noises. She loved it and I was number one on the hit parade.<br /><br />She (we, actually) finished the jar quite quickly and this morning, we dipped into a Cherry Jelly from another famous and well regarded brand. No comparison - the Smucker's just flat blew the other brand away.<br /><br />Like cherries? Like Jelly? Want to have a breakfast party on your toast? Try this wonderful product."
Rather go without,"These have a horrid taste; do not think it would even help to pour hot fudge topping over them. Tried to eat one the day I made them, then tried another the following day after they had rested in the frig. Tossed them in the trash. They are also quite costly; starting with the cost of the mix, you also need to factor in the cost of the baker's chocolate, 1 stick of butter, eggs and heavy cream that are required. Guess I'm just not that desperate to get a chocolate fix, and I'm a chocoholic! There must be a better alternative out there."
Delicious!,"I wasn't expecting much when I first bought these through a local big box store that no longer carries them.  But, they looked like a snack I could eat given my need for things that are fiber rich and generally healthier than most ""treats.""  My response to them was ""Wow, they taste way too good to be healthy!""  The ingredients and nutrition info answer that question.<br />They are delicious, unusual--in a good way!--chocolatey, and way more satisfying than your average cookie, especially the 100 calorie packet kind.  I'm a complete convert, as is my husband, and everyone else who tries them!  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying them.  Please consider carrying more of the Praeventia and Vital Life line by Leclerc."
Doesn't even resembles dragonwell from whole foods or peet's,"It's tea all right, maybe even not that bad of a tea but it's definitively doesn't have that peculiar dragonwell taste AT ALL."
excellent,"I have had trouble finding steel cut oats in quantity locally.  I found thses online and I was familiar withthe brand Red Mill, but they are costly in small quantities.  my daughter was abe to purchase them at Costco where she ives, but I could not find them there so I went online to find them.  This is a stape for us.  We eat them every day."
My Cat Preferred the Chicken,"My cat preferred the chicken treat over the beef.  For that reason, I'm giving it three stars.  There was nothing wrong with the product...more of my cat's preference."
eating healthy,This cereal is awesome. It stays crunchy in the milk. Well worth the money - both the protein and fiber that are are provided by one serving of this cereal along with great taste.
You can buy these a lot! cheaper...,"I don't believe they are selling these for so much, in Seattle we can get them<br />for $1.50 per 16oz. package at the local asian grocery store."
The Greatest Snap I Have Ever Snapped,"I dip these in my coffee -- alone they are probably a bit too crisp.  However, these have excellent flavor and a great ginger burn after you've had 5-10 of them.  Highly recommended."
I love it iced!,I put 8 teabags in a 2 gallon glass container filled with water and leave in the refridgerator overnight.
Tastes like a chocolate doughnut,"Flavored coffees are not my favorite, so this review probably should only get 3 stars from me.  I'll give it 4 because it smells and tastes like what the packages says...a chocolate glazed doughnut.  If you like chocolate glazed donuts then this might be for you.  It tastes like a medium blend.  I might buy more to have around for those who like flavored coffees."
Chinese grocery,"These are a very good choice for making Bubble Drinks, but if you live near a Chinese Grocery store, you can pick up for about 2 Bucks per package...Boba straws run a dollar for 100 straws. The dark brown Boba pearls are also very good."
"I don't care for the taste, but the dogs sure seem to like it","The Everlasting Treats are to be used together with the Everlasting Treat Ball.  (Follow the instructions on how to insert them.  Some of the reviewers had problems with this and the results were not optimal.)<br /><br />My son has a dachshund that devours slippers like they were after-dinner mints and a Corgie that can inhale a sofa leg in under a minute. These dogs are serious chewers.  Nothing satisfied their chewing needs until we found this.<br /><br />The name, Everlasting Treats, is a bit of a hyperbole.  However, it kept my son's dogs quiet and occupied for up to several days.  (Conversely, my own dogs who are not chewers had absolutely no interest in this product. )<br /><br />The dogs are happy and  my son's blood pressure is now down at normal levels."
Great yummy purchase,Had a hard time finding this product but came right to Amazon for luck with a fantastic seller.
Just what I needed,"This is a great addition to my Torani syrup. It does add a little bit of height (some reviewers complained about this) but my countertop height accomodates it, so no complaint here. I like that I get the same amount each time with no spills or drips. I think it's perfect."
ARF ARF !,Our dog tires easily of certain foods and treats however she still gets excited over these sticks. You can end up with a few crumbs on the rug but for the price they're definitely worth trying. Especially if you have a hard to please pooch.
Joy In My Heart,"There is joy in my heart to have discovered that Amazon stocks UNFROSTED Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop Tarts.  To my dismay, the grocery stores in my area no longer carry them.  There's nothing more delightful than to experience the warm, fresh-from-the-toaster goodness of an UNFROSTED Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop Tart with butter slathered on it. I love to make slits in the pastry so that the butter can ooze into the sweet filling. Oh the thought of it!  Thanks Amazon."
Great service,I have ordered twice from this company and have received excellent service and quick shipping both times. The item is wonderful and arrives in perfect condition. I would definitely recommend this vendor and will definitely order from them again myself. Thank you for the great service!
"Love it. all my family love it, delicious!","Love it. all my family love it, delicious!<br /><br />My daughter love it, my wife love it, I love it, all my family love it.<br /><br />Just one word, Delicious, you must try it."
Treats break into perfect pieces for my pup,"I bought these treats because they looked liked they could break into suitable pieces for my pup.  And they did.  Just by hand you could break it down to each leaf of the flower that the treat is shaped to be.  A 7oz bag comes with about 90 treats at ~9 calories each.  I usually break each one into 3 pieces (2 leaves each) and it's a good size for my 20lb pup.  After reading the ingredients, I was under the impression that they'd be kinda chewy but they're baked and hard/crunchy.  The pup takes about 8-10 seconds to finish each 2 leaf piece which is sometimes a little long when trying to train commands and etc but I just break the treats down even more if I need her to eat faster.  The flavor I bought, Pumpkin and Apple, smells great and they don't leave crumbles in my pocket when we're on the go.<br />One thing I should add though is that if you break the fruitables treats into pieces, you'll notice that they're pretty fibrous.  On several occasions my pup's had to cough/clear her throat after feeding her one of these.  But it's not a big deal she loves these treats."
Yellow flavorful yummy missing from your popcorn?  Order this!,"When you go to the movie theater, the popcorn comes coated yellowish and golden.  You love the taste so much that you pick out the yellowist most flavorful kernels and eat them first. You've made popcorn at home, both on-the-stove and the microwave type, and it is missing ""something"".  This popcorn isn't missing anything.  From the tropical based oils to the carefully measured popcorn salt, this has it all.  It tastes exactly like the popcorn you get at the theater.  I've read a few complaints here that this popcorn is too salty.  I don't agree.  In fact when I make it, I add the full amount of oil and salt but withhold about 1/4 of the kernels to amplify the salty greasiness.  When I pop this corn the entire house fills up with that awesome ""movie theater"" popcorn smell but without that nasty microwave undertone.  The price was great, the product rocks, the shipping (even to Alaska!) was free, I can't really think of any constructive criticism for this product.  I don't  have a popcorn kettle, and the instructions on each package shows how to pop this rockstar either on the stove, with an air popper, in a kettle, etc.  So long as the free shipping applies, I will be ordering this product again and again and again."
Taste is weird.,"I am not sure if it is tea-kind related, but neither me or my husband liked the weird after taste of tobacco."
SUGAR FREE SYRUP,"It's always difficult to get a sugar-free anything. But, I was most satisfied with the almond sugar-free syrups and other flavours.  This is not only good in taste but at a very resonable price as well.<br /> You will not be disappointed."
"Finally, an answer to the expensive Keurig cups","So glad that someone came up with these.  We had experimented with several ways to make a filter for the ""fill your own"" kup that came with the Keurig and nothing worked.  These are great and we like the coffee we use much better than the kups from Keurig.  The only problem with the DisposaCups is that sometimes the folds on the paper filters prevent you from securing the lid.  To remedy this, I spread the folds out a little more, then the lid snaps right on.  Great product, saves a ton of money.  And, we reuse the cup and only replace the lid and filter!"
Changed Formula,"These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.  We found out that the company has moved to a new factory/producer and that the formula has changed in some ways.  The flavor is not as fresh and tastes more like processed food. We are really disappointed and are hoping that the company can somehow find its way back to making really great bars."
Stale,"I originally found these in a store and think in general they are awesome, especially for gluten-free, but giving 3 stars since I received  6 bags in an order and 3 of them were stale."
All the flavor without all the fuss!,"I love mulled cider and have always made several batches over the winter months.  (The usual procedure of putting your mulling spices in cheese cloth and doing a quart or so at a time.)  What a nice surprise to find this spice blend that is a powder.  All you do is add some to your hot cider and you can make a single cup if you want, rather than a quart.  Flavor is really nice and works well with wine also."
Got What I Wanted,The gum has a good flavour and works well in my gumball machine. Will order these gumballs again. Recommend this product
A Real Treat,There is no flavor or sweetness lost in this fat-free hot cocoa mix. There are ONLY 20 calories contained in each packet. The cocoa doesn't have a fake taste or lackluster aftertaste. It's honestly one of the best low-calorie hot cocoa drinks  I've ever had. I have yet to find a hot beverage that tastes this good and is only 20 calories...
Good Stuff Ephedra Free,"I used to use the original Mini Thins on occasion for energy boosts (I'm not really a coffee person) and I was skeptical about this ""new"" product that they make, however, I took one in the morning before class and had a pleasant energy boost without coffee jitters (200 mg per pill which is about 2 cups of coffee) I don't know if it is the caffeine, bitter orange peel, ginseng, etc combonation that does it, but it works for me and works well! I will definitely order this again! :-)"
English tradition goes on,"Being married to a person from England, as most people know, they are known for their custom of having tea in the afternoon and always being made in a tea pot with loose tea. It is getting harder too find this in the stores and we are ever so grateful that we can buy it through Amazon. This is our favorite brewing tea and it tastes great! Wouldn't get any other and the price is fantastic. So,if you are a tea lover like we are, give it a try.<br />Thanks for letting us keep up with tradition!!!!!"
Turr&oacute;ns got me an A+ in Spanish!,I was doing an oral presentation for my college Spanish class on Christmas in Spain and I wanted something special to give to my classmates.  These Turr&oacute;ns were perfect!  The price was right and they were fresh and crunchy.  The class loved them and my Spanish Professor gave me an A+ on my presentation.  It doesn't get any better than that!
my dogs really liked this,"I have two min. schnauzers and they tend to be picky eaters.  I was a little reluctant to try this, but am glad I did. They really seem to like Che Michael's!  Thank you Amazon. And having the convienence of having the dog food delivered to the front door is so great!"
Surprisingly Delicious,"I usually have pretty low expectations for boxed dinners, but this dish certainly was surprisingly full of flavor. There was plenty of spice, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is not a fan of hot, spicy food, but if you are buying food from this region, it's probably to be expected (the description calls it mildly spicy). The vegetables dominate the mixture, which was very easy to prepare, even in the microwave. Despite what the box says, you get one nice-sized serving per package. Considering this isn't a dish most would be likely to make on their own, it's a nice cullinary departure and worth a try."
recipe for using rice miracle noodles,"awesome product!  Try the Campbells Healthy Request Chedder Cheese Soup w/ the miracle noodles (rice noodles) instead of using the regular rice suggested on the recipe on the back of the can.  the recipe is for Chipolte Chicken and Rice.  We follow the recipe w/<br />a few changes:  saute onion and bell peppers (we use frozen ones if we're in a hurry for a quick meal) along with either Tyson's frozen pre-cooked and grilled chicken frajita , or 1 lb ground turkey.  Add 2 tbs. tomato paste, 1 can whole black beans w/ a pinch or two of salt and several shakes (to taste) of any mediterranean or morrocan spice blend.  we use ""morrocan twist spice rub"" or use a mediterranean spice mix we made at home from a recipe we found online.  add 3 bags miracle noodles (rinsed and heated in a pan to dry them out a bit), and 2 cans of the campbells healthy request chedder cheese soup and you've got a delicious winner that is a satisfying<br />delicious soul food easily kept in the fridge for 5 days and heated in the microwave as needed. guilt free! Yum.  hope you enjoy!"
yum yum yum!,"They are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than Au Gratin, but nevertheless YUM YUM YUM!"
Red Beer,"Demiri's Bloody Mary seasoning is excellant spice for marinating too..but I put 2 shots in 64 oz bottle of clamato juice, shake well. Pour 1/2 c in frosted mug, pour beer then a sqeeze of lime juice!!! Yum Yum Enjoy"
Good morning wake-up coffee,I find eight o'clock 100% Colombian Ground Coffee very tasty and the price is right.  I have been using this product for over a year. I am very happy with my purchase.
Best so far,"I'm a relative newcomer to Keurig coffee, but I do know that I was generally disappointed in the drink produced. However, the Breakfast in Bed K-Cup produces a nicely balanced, not-too-thin cup without being too harsh. I still haven't achieved anything like what I can make either with my french press or with my drip machine, but it's definitely better than the at-work alternative, Community Coffee."
Awesome product and Seller. Good price super fast shipping.,Thank you for your excellent product. I hope to buy more in the near future. This product is very good for my mind and body. Thank you again.
Good Value,"Eight O'Clock to me was the original A & P brand that we bought eons ago.  Saw it at a good price and bought the French Roast.  It is dark, flavorful and excellent value for a morning starter."
Great tasting diet tea... sometimes,"When mixed perfectly, the MIO Mango Peach iced tea tastes like a diet version of Chili's Mango iced tea which I am a big fan of.<br /><br />The problem is that it is next to impossible to get a consistent strength. I try for 2 medium squirts for the right flavor, but there is no practical way to measure how much mix you are putting in your glass. It squirts out too hard to measure with a measuring spoon. So, some days it is too strong, and I end up dumping the whole thing. Other days, it starts too weak. Of course, adding more makes it too strong. Like Goldilocks, some days, it ends up just right, and it tastes great.<br /><br />The bottle says that it has 24 servings. I haven't been counting, but it seems like a lot more than 24."
I mix with Brown Rice & Quinoa,"At some point I would like to try Teff <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDM6BO"">Bob's Red Mill Whole Grain Teff, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br />I eat lots of Brown Rice & Quinoa I put <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7INI"">Roland Tahini Pure Ground Sesame Seed, 32-Ounce Container (Pack of 2)</a> on it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDB3VW"">Reese Artichoke Bottoms, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> Carrots & Lettuce YUMMMMM<br />Amaranth is more Woodys smell but I Like it now! Haven't gotten to a point where I have it for breakfast..."
"Very good flavor, organic, ""real food"" ingredients","Good stuff. Great flavor. Lightly sweet & ""cinnamony"". Certified organic. You can actually pronounce and read the ingredients, and there aren't many. 47g of whole grains per serving and 5g fiber.<br /><br />I rec'd mine on 2012-04-26 with a ""better if used before"" date of 2012-12-05, so plenty of time to eat 4 boxes all by myself (but I'm betting my wife will help).<br /><br />100% recycled paperboard box (in case it matters to you)."
Great for peanut-lovers,"If you're a lover of things peanuty than this snack is perfect for you - it's almost entirely peanuts.  It says 'peanut granola bar' on the package but there really is minimal amounts of granola - after taking a bite I was like 'there's granola in here?'  You can't really taste it and can hardly see it.  I would say if you're looking for a healthy granola snack than you might want to look else-where, but for a great-tasting peanut snack this is perfect - just the right size to satisfy a peanut craving."
Quite good,"The flavor is very good in this kind, but does it ever pack a punch. With creamer and sweetener in it, it helps alot. When I got my CBTL Briosa, I bought a bunch of these capsules in varying flavors. Some are better than others, but I still love most of them and my machine."
Best Cookie ever!,"I got one of these in my Influenster Mom VoxBox! OMG they were so good, My daughter and I shared the first one then i went and got another box! This are a must have now! They are great to snack on. They are super soft. There is nothing bad to say about these cookies. You must try them!"
Yummy,"My son loves this flavor of the Plum brand.  It tastes and smells like fall.  I'm amazed by their ability to make such a smooth, creamy blend."
Helps Dry Mouth,"I have Sjogrens syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that makes your body attack its moisture producing glands. I have dry mouth very bad and sometimes I have trouble swallowing because of the dryness. This gum has been very helpful with adding moisture and increasing my comfort level. I really like the flavor of the cinnamon gum even though it doesn't last as long as I would like but that's minor in my case."
Makes Autumn a Little Nicer,"At first, I had some cups of this coffee on the 10 ounce setting.  It was watery and lacked flavor.  Then I decided to set it on 8 ounces, used a pack of artificial sweetener, and whipped cream, and found it to be quite delicious.  Could be spicier, could be more pumpkin-like, could be creamier, but all in all, a flavor I enjoy and would order again if offered at other times during the year."
Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!,"Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of ""Brian Amazon"" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing)."
Weird consistency,"I love the taste of ghee butter and this one tastes great. However, the consistency of it is like oil. It is weird and annoying if you want to spread it on toast. The consistency stays that way in air conditioned house."
"Very spicy, strong ginger flavor","The product came as advertised. For the amount you get, the price is right, but the taste of the ginger is stronger than I expected. In fact, it's actually very, very spicy; it burns my tongue and throat, but not as if I were eating hot salsa. Will try using more water, to dilute the flavor."
great taste for a little too much money,dolce Gusto is a great system and great tasting coffee!<br />unfortunately the capsules are more expensive they could be.
Good Cat Food,"My cats do like the food, although when I first started to feed them they kind of picked at it. Now I feed them only this food and a little bit of the dry food from this company and its no problem. My one cat was over weight and he is now more active and running around with the other cats and he looks much healthier and younger. I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry. I do highly recommend this food, its worth the price, considering the vet food is just as expensive and there are lots of pork by-products and low quality grains in the ingredient list."
Don't EVEN make your own!!,"This sauce has everything I love.  It's thick, tomatoey, great spices and low calorie.  I started making pizza at home and this sauce is the best.  I also decided to use it with pastas, meatloaf, anything requiring tomato sauce.  If it's too thick for your personal taste, just cut it with a can of Muir Glen diced tomatoes or the fire roasted diced.  Fantastic!  I'm just waiting for Amazon to get it back on subscribe and save.  SO much less expensive."
Start your habanero adventure here.,"Its not always about the heat, sometimes its about the blend, and this ""Extra Hot"" Sauce<br />from Melinda's has one of the freshest and cleanest tastes of all the major brands.<br /><br />All pepperheads know there's a sauce out there for everything, and this stuff really shines<br />on veggies and fish, two things you wouldn't necessarily put something like Tabasco or a<br />heavier darker blend of habanero, et.al. Now, this stuff is not vinegary as someone noted,<br />its heavy on the carrots and a little thicker than most of its counterparts. I can't taste<br />any vinegar at all for that matter so I'm not sure where that comment came from.<br /><br />Use this to enhance the flavor of foods, not to blow the top of your head off. If you like<br />the flavor of this stuff and want something hotter then Melinda's makes a XXXXtraHot brand<br />that should suit your evolving needs for a good burn."
Organic Chinese Product too Sweet to Believe,"I tasted these before giving them to my kids and the strawberry flavor is very sweet.  I couldn't believe it was this sweet by using natural/organic sugars (and not pushing the calorie count up).  I have not had these tested by a lab or anything like that, but I found these ""too good to be true"" to give them to my kids."
Jellybeans,These are a familly favorite and great for the holidays or as a gift.  They were a gift and well received.
They are really good,"---<br /><br />I usually by the Crown Price sardines in Louisiana hot sauce, but I wanted a change so I tried these.<br /><br />And man are they good! The smoked flavor is so nice.<br /><br />I definitely recommend them.<br /><br />---"
Possibly the best cereal ever invented.,"I'm not even kidding; this cereal is sooooo good. Sometimes I'll eat a whole box in a day because I just can't help myself. It is crunchy, yet not too hard on your teeth, and the texture only improves with a good milk (soymilk) soaking. The other flavors are great too, but something about the peanut butter makes this the best flavor with creamy undertones in the flavor. You won't be disappointed. Get some and you'll be on cloud nine."
YUM!,"These cookies are so good. They bake up to be perfectly chewy. The lemon flavor zings your tastebuds just a little. They actually taste a lot like froot loops. One box made about 24 cookies, and we ate half of them right out of the oven because they were so good."
Mild pumpkin flavor,"This is a good, clean tasting syrup with mild pumpkin flavor.  It does not, by itself, replicate the flavor of the pumpkin spice latte from *bucks, but it tastes good and is a nice seasonal flavor."
salba a new trend,I had read an ad in my local newspaper for salba. After checking some info thru Google I ordered some.Maybe I am wrong but i feel the salba has increased my energy. I take salba instead of fish oil. I take flaxseed oil caps also.salba is a bit pricey so i am taking 2 a day instead of 3.I am glad to have started using it.
Only food my cats can agree on,"This is the only flavor of Science Diet (or any other brand) they will all eat without complaint. I don't know what I'll do if they stop making it. I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to ""improve"" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is."
This has saved me a lot of money,"I live in a wooded area and use Terro outdoors on the deck and the house and it has worked great since I started using it three months ago.  It seems everyone in this community pays a bundle for quarterly pest services but what we really only have trouble with are carpenter ants.  Why pay and spray all those poisons if you don't need to?  And, at Lowe's, I purchased a broom type device that's in the broom section and sprinkle the Terro on the furry end, it has a telescopic arm that extends quite long, that way I can reach the high parts of my house and spread the Terro powder way up there.  It's only $10 and you can identify it by the yellow furry top.  I hope this helps!"
Amazing aroma!,"I just got my order - their shipping is pretty fast!  And the smell of this matcha is just unbelievable.  This is so rich and sweet smelling, you would think it had a million and two calories, but it doesn't!  The flavor lives up to what the aroma promised.  I made this into lattes for an afternoon snack for myself and one of my kids and we loved it!  Plus we are getting a nice antioxidant boost at the same time.  Thank you, Red Leaf!  How will I ever get around to all the flavors I want to try?"
Awesome product!!!,"After the intial rehydration period is over. You can make a  tasty, healthy, probiotic rich drink for your family. It is really tasty with sliced fresh ginger and sliced organic lemon added to the finished product. You can flavor your drink with fresh fruit, dried fruit or even juice just to name a few Once you buy the grains as long as you keep them feed, they will live indefinately."
taste like popcorn,"My baby's more than one year old. he don't like its taste, though i hope he can eats them, for i bought 4 cans. maybe it just eats like popcorns and has no other chedder taste."
Best Sauce in a Jar.  Period.,"The Marinara and Tomato Basil sauces are the closest to real Italian sauce that I have ever tested, probably better, having just returned from 2 weeks in Italy.  And we ate very well there.  I had tried in vain for years to find a good sauce in a jar but had no luck.  Until I tried the Batali sauce.  It's in the weekly rotation now.  Worth every penny.  Better than going out to eat without a doubt."
"I just recieved the product (Oct. 20, 2009)","and the expiration date on top of the can says Jan.06,05. I cannot even return it since it is a grocery. Amazon, are you serious?"
Best Gluten Free Pasta Out There,"This is the best gluten free pasta that I have found to date.  I first tried it at a local restaurant that has a large gluten free menu and loved it!  It has a much firmer consistency than the rice pastas do.  Even my middle son, the pickiest eater I know, cleaned his plate."
Wrong size & wasn't allowed to return for correct size,"The tea itself is fine, I've been using it for some time.  However, I wanted the family size, which this was not and even though unopened, it couldn't be returned for the proper size.  Not real thrilled with that.  Make my tea by the pitcher not the cup."
too much caffine / serving,"if you consider that we're suppose to drink 8+ cups of water a day and each serving (if mixed w/ recommended proportions), you'd get 480 mg of caffine. that's way over recommended levels.<br />the flavor is fine, but also tangy. it mixes easily enough, seems to mix very well and doesn't seperate as far as i can tell, also, this drink contains b vitamins (which is what energy drinks use to make the caffine more efficient).<br /><br />The caffine content is on the label (60mg/serving), in the fine print under the nutritional facts. The label does mention caffine on the front, but it isn't clearly labeled, they put it in the fine print!<br /><br />I would have given this four stars if any of these were true: the caffine content was better displayed, if it had less caffine, if it wasn't so tangy, if they clearly labeled a warning / caution about the high levels of caffine / serving.<br /><br />If you decide you need flavor in your water and find yourself drinking huge gulps because you think: it's mostly water and you think it's healthy to drink huge ammounts of water, then don't use the recommended mix proportions. each cup of water  contains a lot of caffine, this drink isn't meant to be a ""gulped"" drink, it should be thought of as similar to coffee. limit your daily intake of this! and don't drink this in the evening hours! it's caffine + b vitamins. you'll probably ruin your sleep schedule if you drink this hours before you're supppose to sleep. it is more of an energy drink, not a refreshment.<br /><br />the first time i tried this, i mixed a full pitcher, 1/2 gallon or about 8 cups, without realizing how much caffine it had (i actually didn't know it had any, i thought the ""energy"" in the title was part of the name of the flavor) and it made me very jittery throughout the day. I feel this experience was partially my fault and partially the label's fault, it should have done a better job stating the important info, but i technically should have read the entire package (and the included manual, haha) before i decided to try it. But, this experience has little influence over my rating / review of this product."
These are High Value Doggie Treats,When we found these treats at Costco we bought them because of their simple wholesome ingredient list. Our doggie loved them but then Costco did not sell them anymore and we ordered them from Amazon. Same great product at a fair price. These treats are worth the $$$. I cut them up smaller and they last a long time.
Great deal on great beans,"Heinz beans with tomato sauce are easily my favorite baked beans. (Beanz means Heinz, right?) I use them frequently when making English breakfasts and they are great for beans on toast, or just as a side. The subscription option with Amazon is great, giving an even further discount and allowing customers to stop or rush their next orders at their discretion. The price is very good compared to the store price.<br />Also, as I have been ordering these for some time now, I have not had any serious problems with the condition of the cans. They have always seem packaged rather well in my shipments."
cat treats,Blossom likes this one occasionally.  I like that they are dry on the outside so they do not go stale so quickly
Great - as expected.,These are very tasty - easy to fix.  A great snack for diabetics.  No carbs!
black tiger coffee,"I have no problems with the delivery of the coffee, nor the price.  It is cheaper to buy 50 k-cups than to buy the 80 count thru Green Mountain.  However, the coffee just is not that good.  It lacks a cripness in its taste."
Fantastic popcorn.,I use this in my 6 quart Whirley pop maker.  The popcorn maker over flows with delicious popcorn every time.  Hardly any old maids!  I am a true convert now - I will only use these premeasured packets.
Simply the Best,"I've purchased various types of honey from Amazon and other sources, so far this is the best tasting.  This honey is not runny at all, so you can spread it on toast or bagels. I will definitely be buying more in the future."
best dog food on the market,"When I first found my dog at a shelter I started feeding her eukanuba and a few other mainstream brands. Then, I decided to start organic foods. I tried several different brands until I found this. Great ingredients, trusted by MANY pet stores, and my dog LOVES IT! I've tried the lamb, chicken and whitefish flavors. She loves them all. Price is on par with most stores as well! she is now 12 years old and still going strong!"
The best,"Yummy! I bought these awhile ago and a little go a long way. Eat a small handful on their own or mixed with plain dried fennel seeds after dinner, helps with digestion & much better for you than M&Ms. When I run out, I'll be buying this brand again."
This is my Honey !,"Bee venom was used by the Egyptians thousands of years ago for various ailments, A friend recently brought back Manuka Honey with Glucosamine & Bee Venom for me to try, Bee Venom releases Cortisone & Hydrocortisone in the body, helping to heal and making one feel fantastic. Glucosamine, although wonderful in helping rebuild Cartilage, tends to also increase Cholesterol but that might be in much larger doses. I have never felt this good in my life, I started with an 1/8 of a teaspoon but was able to increase it to a full teaspoon in about 3 weeks. I recently bought 3 additional jars and have started my 2nd one last week. Bee Venom can sometimes have an effect on one's blood pressure, causing it to rise but in my case, I just lessened the amount I was taking and things got back to normal quickly. I test my blood pressure daily, just to be on the safe side. My Father, his wife & my wife are currently also taking Manuka Honey with Glucosamine & Bee Venom."
We won't use any other marinade for steak!,"Best steak marinade out there.  Easy (just uses water) and so, so, simple.  No overnight crap - just marinate and grill and TASTES WONDERFUL!!!"
great taste,I'm grateful for my Keurig coffee maker!  The taste of Green Mountain brand Dark Magic is terrific & got used up real fast!
Matcha green tea powder,I enjoy Starbuck's version w/melon flavor in latte and frapuccino. At home I just blend mine with vanilla soy milk which I think tastes awesome.
Crown Prince places fewer sardines in each can,"For years until my last purchase, Crown Prince placed five large Moroccan sardines in each can. Now, this company is putting solely three sardines of a slightly different appearance in each can, accompanied by a much increased amount of tomato paste.<br /><br />This was a deplorable decision. Do executives of the company think that by adding more tomato paste, customers will not notice the 40% decline in the number of sardines posited in each can?"
Great Price!,"I have enjoyed Big Franks for years.  Now that Amazon carries them I can get them delivered to my door at a price (including shipping, subscription plan) that is lower than I can find anywhere else."
Try them!,"I tried these because of a friend's recommendation.  I was weary.  One bite was all it took for me to get hooked.  These are a far more nutritious salty snack than potato chips are.  Sure the taste is different, but I usually grab potato chips when I want something salty, not potato-y.  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"
tasty kona coffee!,"Love kona coffee. This product is great for pods, though somewhat watery, but still very good. Will probably buy more for my de longhi espresso machine!"
My Favorite Hot Sauce,"Louisiana is a close second and was my favorite before I tried Bufalo.  Rick Bayless turned me onto this stuff.  It's fantastic!  Very Earthy, not too hot, but hot enough.  And it's low-cal.  I use it on all kinds of stuff.  Chicken, beef, pork; if I want to spice something up in a Mexican way, I reach for Bufalo.  I don't buy it on Amazon.  I buy it at the Latin grocer for much less than this.  A little over a dollar."
Tasty Tea,"I just finished brewing a container of this tea to keep in the fridge.  I pre-sweetened it with some simple syrup, making it less sweet than most restaurants serve it as I don't care for super sweet tea.  I'm not a connoisseur but this tastes very similar to the teas I have had in restaurants.  I do wish there was no artificial food coloring (yellow)."
Great baby food,"This is great for your little one, no artificial flavors or additives. But I found out after buying the stage 1, that stage 2 is cheaper & you get more."
Great Product,"Wonderful cat food.  Very nutritious (from what I can see from my cat's behavior, not me personally sampling) and I appreciate the fact that it's organic.  I would def recommend this product and buy more for my little man in the future."
Product Arrived Damaged Twice- UPDATE!!!,"I had the same experience as another reviewer. I love this dressing and my local supermarket stopped carrying the product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. My shipment arrived poorly packaged. All the bottles were leaking and the seals had been broken. Considering that the dressing needs to be refrigerated after being opened I did not want to eat it. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement order free of charge. The second shipment was no better and I had to discard all the bottles. I wonder if Amazon is responsible for the poor packaging or if it is the vendor and whether or not it may be the heat during shipping that is causing all the seals to be broken.<br /><br />UPDATE: The manufacturer/company contacted me after this review and offered to send me a case of their dressing for my troubles. It arrived in a matter of days and all the bottles were undamaged. Their customer service is impeccable, making sure to follow up with me after I had received the delivery to ensure all was ok. I loved this product before and love it even more now. Wonderful experience! Thank you, WAFU!"
Good coffee,I have used this site and brand for birthday present and christmas present. It is a very good german coffee.
Weak Tea,"We were hoping for a strong cinnamon tea, but this one is rather mild. It also has more black tea taste than cinnamon."
Great Taste and Texture,"The word 'bitter' is a category, not the experience of this wonderfully fruity and chunky preserve. Hero brand Orange Marmalade Bitter has plenty of sweetness yet the natural tang is present, along with orange fiber and rind to enliven morning toast. Try it on roast pork. This is my favorite fruit spread of any kind, hands down. I give it 6 stars."
Best Vegetarian Sausage Mix,"I have tried several vegetarian sausage mixes and this one is by far the best. It is easy to use and cooks up just like real sausage would. The flavor is awesome, not too strong and not salty.  I have prepared meals with it for those who are not vegetarians and they didn't even know that it wasn't real sausage until I told them. Go ahead...try it! :)"
Great Tea,I look forward to this tea each holiday season. This year I couldn't find it in local grocery stores so I checked Amazon and there it was! Thanks Amazon - it's a great black tea at a great price.
A little taste of home.,Being from Western Kentucky it was great to find this little gem. A taste of home all the way out in California. The mix of flavors goes good on anything from chicken to brisket...could not ask for a better sauce to bring out the flavors of my BBQ.
Not By The Box,"I really enjoyed eating this macadamia delights from Meiji. The chocolate has a great, and not too sweet, taste. The nuts are a bit small, if you are used to larger varieties, but that is a small problem.<br /><br />I found they were not good for my feeding frenzies. Stuffing a whole box down in about 3 minutes is not a good idea, as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat. Taken at a more leisurely pace, they are a real treat."
Yummy Yummy in my Tummy!,"This granola is fantastic.  It's crunchy, there's a lot of chocolate chunks in it, and it's healthy - what more can I ask for?  I eat this granola with yogurt for breakfast or afternoon snack. If I'm looking for a little chocolate fix at night, I don't feel bad about snacking on something this good for me!"
The pineapple flavor is a bit too much for me...,"...so I drink mine diluted.  These sticks are meant for 16 ounce water bottles, but I empty a stick into a one (1) liter empty bottle which I fill with water from my Mavea water pitcher.  It still tastes heavy on the pineapple; in fact, I don't notice any mango or tea flavors at all. There is a ""too sweet"" aftertaste, also."
Great if you love to eat insects,"They use carmine (cochineal) to color this. In other words, crushed insects. I'd rather have it not such a vibrant color and insect-free. This product is not kosher or vegetarian."
Taco seasoning,This taco seasoning was not good.  We used it once and threw the remainder away.<br />I was disappointed since the other seasonings were very good.
Really strong taste but also gave me a headache.,"For the mixture recommendations on the package this is stuff has a REALLY strong taste and I don't care for that too much but that's an easy fix with just adding more water to knock it down a level. I don't mind the flavor at all but I quickly found out that I have a reaction to something in this mix as each time I tried I ended up with a headache from hell. The first time I just thought it was because I had been working on my computer for 16 hours a day for a couple days but after the next 2 times I realized it was the crystal light that was doing it.<br /><br />NOT COOL.<br /><br />The package says one packet makes 2 quarts, I watered this stuff down with a full gallon and thought it tasted pretty good at that level but the headache still happened even at that level.<br /><br />This product contains ASPARTAME, which is an artificial sweetener, I've never had the stuff before because I don't care for artificial stuff but apparently I can't have it to begin with as that is more than likely the culprit in the headaches that this stuff gave me.<br /><br />ASPARTAME/PHENYLKETONURICS contains PHENYLALANINE<br /><br />Phenylalanine is found naturally in the breast milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement for its reputed analgesic and antidepressant effects. It is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenylethylamine, a commonly used dietary supplement.<br /><br />That's just a little bit of info for you, you can do with it as you like...<br /><br />I don't know 100% that this is what caused my headache but it's the only off ingredient listed on the back panel. With that I'm drawn to conclude that it is was caused the problems I had. Regardless I will be sure to stay away from products containing this stuff in the future...<br /><br />NUTRASWEET contains a form of aspartame in it as well."
Have to order too much,At first I loved this popcorn but lately the smell is getting to me as it pops in the  microwave.  They make you order such a large volume and the shipping is quite costly.  I had to give a lot of it away for fear that it would go stale before I could  eat it all.  I recently switched to hot air popcorn because it doesn't have that odor that the microwaveable  ones put out.
For Nessie,These are great!  Our dog needed to take medicine 2X/day for a month.  Getting her to take the pills was hard until these pill pockets.  We simply put the medicine in the pocket and she ate it right up!  They are the best!
CRUSHED Fritos,"I am certain that these Chili Cheese Fritos would have been perfect if not for the UPS treatment of the box.  They arrived in a box that had been smashed and had holes in it.  Only a fair amount of packing tape held it together.  There were actually smashed fritos on my front step from the 5 or so bags of chips that exploded in its trip.  The remainder of the un-opened bags taste fine, albeit the fritos are noticably smaller.  It just wasn't worth complaining but since you asked...."
"Raw Sugar, fabulous!","This is the best sugar, and it is raw, so it is not refined like the normal white sugar we all use.  I choose this over the white sugar anyday!  It just makes me feel like even though I'm using sugar (which is not so good for you), that I am choosing to use a ""healthier"" version!"
Not my preference in licorice,I prefer soft licorice. I do NOT prefer salt licorice.  At least not licorice this salty.  And I agree there seems to be this note of bleach in the bouquet (if licorice can be said to have a bouquet).  Give me the sweet stuff anytime!  This stuff? Not so much.
GOOD PASTA,I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF LINGUINE AS BEING WIDER THAN REGULAR SPEGHETTI BUT THIS PASTA IS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE OR THINNER. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE TASTE IS GOOD. IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND GOOD SPINACH LIGUINE IN OUR AREA SO WAS HAPPY TO FIND THIS ON AMAZON AND IT WAS WORTH A TRY. SUCCESS.
best coffee....but price not so much,"This is the best coffee ever (french roast,original and columbian) but you can get it cheaper in a grocery store (about 16$ w/tax for 36 oz bag)."
PJ's Coffee,I very much enjoy Green  Mountain coffee and I especially love the darker blends.<br />It is great to receive these products so quickly!
Great price for volume,"I bought this as our office mix of coffee. It's a great price for a four flavor selection. My office didn't love the extra bold flavor, so I am giving it a 4 out of 5"
maybe a 6 on a 10 point scale,"Jack Link's Beef Steak, Flavor, 1-Ounce Packages<br /><br />These are a nice snack, maybe a 6 on a 10 point scale, I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYVKRS"">Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots (120 beef sticks per bag)</a><br /><br />Gunner March, 2010"
Delicious,"I had about given up on finding anything that tasted even remotely like peanut butter. If you have any allergies to nuts or peanut butter, you know how frustrating it can be to have to avoid a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I haven't had one for what seems like years.<br /><br />Then, I found this amazing soynut butter. It is totally peanut free, which means it is also made in a ""Peanut/Nut"" free facility.<br /><br />Ingredients: Roasted Soybeans (Non-GMO), Naturally Pressed Soy Bean Oil, Maltodextrin, (from Corn) Soy Protein Isolate, (Granulated Cane Juice), Mono and Diglycerides (derived from Vegetable Oil), Salt.<br /><br />This product is also temptingly delicious with Mi-Del Gingersnaps that are made with non-hydrogenated canola oil.<br /><br />I'm imagining the possibilities - SoyNut Cookies instead of Peanut Butter cookies.<br /><br />Other features:<br /><br />30% Less Fat than Peanut Butter<br />Cholesterol Free<br />Dairy & Gluten Free<br />Low Sodium<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
Flyboy Cessna,"I had a hard time finding the tea I had purchased in the past at my local market.  They had stopped carring the flavor of tea I like eventhough they still carried Stash Tea products.  So I went on the internet and was directed to Amazon and found it right away.  Not only that, the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market.  By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it."
"My new favorite dark chocolate bar, organic and ""slave-free""","I tend to prefer darker chocolate -- 65-70%.  So I was expecting this 54% bar to be sweeter or creamier, thus not entirely to my liking.<br /><br />I found this bar neither waxy nor chalky, as some of the darkest chocolates can be. Neither is it quite creamy. Rather, it melts very slowly in my mouth, leaving none of the bitterness of some dark chocolates and none of the filminess, either. I guess you'd call it a clean finish!<br /><br />Neither my palate nor my reporting skills are entirely sophisticated when it comes to chocolate. I can't pinpoint the flavor as being like that of any tropical or tree fruit. And, like most people, I have my preferences and so my opinion is highly subjective.<br /><br />What I can say is that I like this bar very much and will be interested in the other bars in this Newman's line.  I also like patronizing this brand, as they do so much good work through its non-profit efforts.  I also like the fact that it is organic and that, as best I can determine, this is slave-free chocolate.  That is worth paying a few cents extra for, in my opinion."
Love this but not at $92!,"I bought EXACTLY the same thing today at Marshalls for $12.99.  Same company, same thing. Absolutely no difference.  $92 for salt - I don't care what kind of salt it is ... $92?!!!"
Best cookie in the world!,"If you love the taste of caramel and the crisp crunch of a thin cookie that doesn't fill you up, there's no better alternative. I can eat this all day!"
Still not sure....,"I have been giving my dog this for several weeks as a treat and am not sure if she is really getting any juice or she just loves the smell. It is hard to tell if the ball is turning when she licks it or if it remains stationary. She always comes running when she sees me pull it out the pantry so I assume that she is still getting her 'treat'. I do like the size of the container, but wish that I could tell how much is remaining."
Uptown,"I ordered two prayer plants from this seller.  The result was totally unexpected.  The leaves where huge, the rootball was very healthy,they are in excellent health, better than I would of got from an uptown florist in my area.I am fivehundred percent pleased with my purchase, the cost was modest, the shipping was quick,the rootball was well protected, not much dirt got on the leaves during shipping. I would recommend this company to everyone."
Excellent in Espresso,We use this as a falvorful addition to the espresso my wife makes (she used to be a barista) and it works well with a medium roast bean.
Non-Flavored coffee drinkers beware!,I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.
"Delicious, Easy, and Versatile","I followed the simple cooking instructions that are on the package.  This pre-cooking stage is very important, but luckily takes only a few minutes, which you can use to prepare the other ingredients for the mix.<br /><br />I had this as a simple stir-fry with steamed broccoli, onion, carrot -- whatever vegetables were handy.  I then added just a spoonful of (homemade) pickled ginger and a few drops of squeezed lime juice.  Heavenly!<br /><br />These were so tasty that I would never have guessed they were made of brown rice, if I had not had the package close by.<br /><br />Easily makes enough for two meals."
delicious!,These cookies are great! Wonderful to go with a cup of coffee in the afternoon.
Smells & Tastes Awful,"I don't know much about this tea, but heard about it's beneficial qualities on the Dr OZ show, so thought I would try it.  If you can get past the smell & then the taste, maybe you can benefit from the tea.  I tried it for a few times, then could not stand it."
Greenies Pill Pockets Chicken 7.9 oz for Capsules,Fantastic product. I use both the Chicken and the Beef flavor and both are great. It is the only way I can get my dog to take pills. These definitely work well!
"Tasted wonderful, but did not suppress my appetite.","So if your on Atkins, or a low carb diet, and want a beautiful, sinfully delicious candy treat, this is it. No chemical notes at all, tasted just like sugar, rich chocolate, and creamy caramel. If you want to feel less hungry, it didn't do it for me."
Bad results with this formula.,"Our newborn was around 2 months old and was having some stomach issues after feeding. We tried Similac advance, Similac sensitive and Gerber good start but nothing worked to ease his digestive problems.<br />The nest step was to try something like Lipil or Alimentum and after some recommendations we went with this stuff. He would drink it without any problems but after about 4 days the problems started. Initially his bowel movements became a little watery. This gradually turned into him having some liquidous discharge in every diaper and an inflamed area around his butt. We kept him on it for about 3 more days but with the inflamed area getting worse we took him off of it. Once off his stool returned to normal and the rash or inflamed area cleared up.<br />I cannot recommend this formula at all, especially after reading numerous other bad reviews on the internet."
Yummy Little Chocolate Chip Cookies,"I purchased these for my children, to pack a sweet yet relatively healthful snack in their lunch sacks.  I am giving 5 stars by the recommendation of myself & three sons (age 7, 5 & 3).  When I tasted these, my first thought was that they were going to be gone FAST.  My children and I love these little cookies ... Crunchy little gems without all the trans-fats & preservatives, that I try to keep out of my children's diets as much as I can.  These will definitely remain on my grocery list."
Pretty darn good,I have received open bag of coffee before from Amazon also. Simply call Amazon customer service and tell them it was open and you want another shipment sent or your money back. They wont make you send back an open food item and will tell you to throw it out however I brewed it anyway!. As far as the coffee review its very good coffee for just about 5 bucks a pound with the discounts going on.
Effective magnet,"These ""magnets"" are very effective in capturing insects, and I am happy to be using something that is not poisonous or a danger to pets. They don't eliminate insects, however, so really should be used in combination with other products, such as gels (used judiciously so as not to harm animals)."
Another good one,"This is my second best, other than the Kahlua by Timothy's. I recommend it if you do not like flavoured coffee; this would be a good alternative."
Great Quality and Price,"I ordered this tea after reading about the many health benefits of Matcha tea, the healthiest of all Green teas.  I knew it would be dark green and milky- not clear and brownish as regular green teas.  But, I did not know that Matcha tea is actually green tea leaves ground into a very fine powder.  So, you do not need a tea infuser, but instead mix the powder with hot water and drink the actual tea leaves! No wonder Matcha tea boasts more of a health punch than green tea bags.  Now, in my opinion Matcha tea is not a pleasant drink.  It is thick and deep green, looking and tasting very similar to wet grass clippings.  I mixed the tea with honey and could stomach the first two cups, but the third cup made me gag.  Thankfully, this is a tea powder, so now I just put some in the blender with my yummy berry smoothies (yogurt, water, honey, ice, blueberries, other berries) and the grass taste isn't noticeable.  At the Amazon price of 38% off, this is an outstanding value for a whole 4-ounces of tea compared to other brands!  It is organic and comes in a recycled brown paper bag housed in a recycled box, along with an instruction card.  Arrived promptly in 2 business days as always with Amazon Prime!"
Gum with function,"As mere gum, this isn't the best in the world.  It loses flavor faster than I'd like.  However, as a delivery mechanism for caffeine, this is good stuff."
great cup of cold coffee,This is a great deal. Much less pricey than getting the packets at the store or Staruck's. Easy to make. Great to drink.
This is the best buy and our dogs like it too!,So much cheaper than store prices and same taste at almost half the price at walmarts! Got 2 older dogs and they picky about their food and love do like this but this is a real  bargain if you feed dogs canned food!
Pleasantly surprised!,"For the past year, I have had a monthly shipment of the Diedrich French Roast sent to my house.  When they discontinued the subscribe and save for that product I was very disappointed and had to find a new french roast.  After reading the reviews I decided to give the San Francisco Bay a try.  I was a bit skeptical about the package and I am very picky about taste, however, I just brewed my first cup and I love it!  It has a really rich flavor that seems to have more of the natural oils that you would find in a french press.  Sounds crazy, but it seems to be true!  The aroma is wonderful as well.  I haven't gotten to the end of my first cup quite yet so I don't know if there is more sediment, but hey, I like french press so a little sediment won't kill me.  I plan to make this coffee my new subscribe and save."
AMAZING!! I am addicted to Grandpa Po's!,"I LOVE this snack!! I ordered one case and since have ordered about 25!!  They are just salty enough to satisfy your cravings, just spicy enough to give you a little kick, and just sweet enough to stop you from grabbing that candy bar...I can't think of a better, more healthy, satisfying snack food - you have GOT TO TRY THEM!!  Trust me, you will not be disappointed!!<br />[...]"
The Cat's Meow!,"I had the hardest time trying to find a cat food my cats would eat. Every time I got one they would sniff it and then act as if burying it so I could tell they hated it. Finally, I found this food. My cats will not even eat the same flavor even from another brand. I was so upset when Target put the individuals on sale and stopped selling them. Needles to say, when I found this on Amazon I was very happy. Reasonably priced for the amount and my cats are completely satisfied. Will also be ordering from here!"
High Quality Treats,"Chock full of power-house ingredients like quinoa and flax, these treats are thankfully free of wheat, soy and other common allergens making them nice to have on hand for puppy play dates or visiting furry friends who might have dietary restrictions. They have a neutral smell and don't leave smudges or stains on carpet the way many treats can. My dog loved them.<br /><br />The compact, resealable bag is great for travel. My only word of caution is that with only six treats per bag, they go quickly!"
Perfect Apples for baking,"These apples packed in water give you the opportunity to add (or not) whatever you want to add as you prepare them for a dish.  Since they are no longer found in the grocery stores, it is a gold mine for me that I can get them from Amazon. An apple pie made with these tastes like you peeled the apples yourself!"
Salsa Casera Redux?,"Ounce for ounce, Herdez Salsa Casera in the 7 oz can was the best canned (or jarred) salsa 'around'!! I even ordered it, by the case, from Mex-Grocer on-line! Recently I bought a can from Publix in Florida & the can had a new label. The salsa has been changed!!!Still pretty good, but not the same. Not sure what has changed, but not as good as the old version which I rated 5 stars!!"
love this salt,I love this salt.  I prefer to use this salt over any other salt.  I recommend this salt.  It tastes great.
Hamster food in disguise!  No thanks,"Well... looks like hamster food, smells like hamster food, oh yeah and it TASTES like hamster food!  These crispbread crackers are nothing short of disgusting.  Health food does not mean that it needs to taste bad! I find nothing wrong with all-natural foods that actually taste good.  There are plenty of alternatives that offer whole grain and fiber and are much more flavorful.  The no sodium aspect is difficult to ignore but unless your tastebuds have suffered some sort of great catastophre than I warn you to look elsewhere for something more palatable..."
Poor Customer Service,"The original title of the Jumbo Sunflower seeds stated 12 per case. I ordered them based on that information, figuring out the cost of each bag I would be paying. When I received them, the case only had 10 bags. I wrote to them TWICE and received NO response. I expected a refund for the two missing bags or for them to send me two additional bags.  But they didn't even have the courtesy to reply.  Since then, I see they have changed the title to ""10 bags"".  However, the description still says 12.  Be aware you will only get 10 and it's a horrible price to pay for such small bags."
Great,"We love these garbanzo beans (or chick peas).  They are never mushy, always firm.  We add them to stir-fry and chili. They are also good in salads.  The cans do not have BPA, which is very important to me.  As far as I know, Eden Organic is the only company that does not use BPA in their bean cans.  Highly recommend!"
Vegetable soup flavoring,"This is a really super flavor, and a totally different addition to most any dish."
yummy,this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day.  the taste is smooth and warm and creamy.  i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes. what a treat.
I like this tea,Unlike some reviews I found this tea a little weak at first .... now I got used to it and I love it!
burns the skin off your lips,"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market."
Quite a good cup of instant coffee,"Starbucks Via will not replace a well-crafted hand-brewed cup of coffee from your favorite coffee shop, but it's a hell of a lot better than what you probably expect instant coffee to taste like.<br /><br />If your experience with instant coffee stops at Taster's Choice or Folgers, be prepared to be wowed. Those products produce a result that tastes and looks like water with some coffee flavoring. Starbucks Via is much more like a ""real"" cup of coffee.<br /><br />Another advantage of Via is that the packets are soluble in cold or tepid water, so it's possible to mix yourself a glass of iced coffee right away, rather than having to brew and then cool coffee first.<br /><br />At about $1 per cup, it's certainly less expensive than fresh-brewed Starbucks coffee, though it's still more expensive than brewing coffee at home using a drip maker, french press or whatever other process you prefer. But for when you're on the run or on the road, it's quite a serviceable and enjoyable cup of coffee without too much muss and fuss. I bring Via packets with me when I travel, for example, and keep them on hand for when I'm not in the mood or don't have the time to brew a whole pot."
Secret Ingredient,"I love this product. I originally bought it to put in dipping oil for bread (like Macaroni Grill). But I have since sprinkled it on everything like salad, cous cous, vegetables etc. I also bread chicken with these and panko bread crumbs. They have a good little crunch and hold up well to moisture. The flavor is subtle not over powering garlic. They are light enough that they actually stick to food instead of falling to the bottom and being wasted. Love them. With a six pack I end up just sending home a jar with friends."
Ok Food,"I have used this food for 3 months, and at first I thought it was great. But have since taken all my dogs off of it. Their coats are dry and have bad hair loss. Some dogs it is hard to keep weight on them with this food."
Wonderful,"This product is great! I would recommend purchasing xanthan gum as well, because it isn't as stable as Bisquick in the dough holding together, just a tiny bit works wonders. As mentioned before, it can be purchased for less than half the price from Netrition. The blueberry muffins are delicious, and I use regular Bisquick recipes substituting Carbquik and sugar substitute and have had no bad results."
My Favorite Tea,I know most people love the more expensive brands of tea....but this is my favorite.  It's also cheaper to order from Amazon that Kuerig.
Okay in Small Amounts,"I'm a regular drinker of powdered drink mixes. I really like that the Mio concentrate is liquid instead of powder. There's no need to trouble yourself for minutes shaking/stirring to get a powder dissolved - everything's ready to go with one quick swish of a spoon or shake of a bottle.<br /><br />I wasn't struck by any particularly bad artificial flavor/chemical aftertaste upon first sip. But with each additional sip I took, some weird taste was building up unfavorably in my mouth as well. By the end of my 8 oz serving, I was convinced I would not be buying more of this product (at least not this flavor). The taste wasn't exactly chemical for me. It tasted more like the raw bitterness you may be familiar with that you get from eating fuzzy peach skin. If I were to be juicing peaches, I would normally peel the skin off first to avoid getting that taste in my juice, but this mix seems to have captured peach skin along with the rest of the fruit. Not a bad drink to have a few sips at a time, but after a whole cup, sip after sip, the ""skin"" taste concentrated so much to something very unpalatable.<br /><br />I don't mind drinking this a little at a time, but this is not something I can tolerate in large quantity if I were really thirsty."
The perfect size for a side veggie,"I really like the glass jars.  As an urban teacher, we use the jars for art classes, but even if we didn't they're more earth friendly than the plastic tubs or bags that other foods come in.  My son LOVES the earth's best carrots.  They're tasty without any of the extras.  I also like the size of the jar.  It's just right to use for two nights of veggie sides."
"excellent health benefits, excellent product",Fearn employed the most healthful way of producing this health benefit called wheat germ. I am very happy and my money is very well spent. Thanks Fearn.
Sweet Coconut Flavor with A Mild Aftertaste.  Mild to Medium Blend.,"Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.<br /><br />This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size."
Best Rice Ever!,"This rice tastes so good. I have tried lots of other Broccoli Cheese Rice mixes and nothing tastes anywhere near as good as this. It's easy to make too. I always put it in the microwave and add an extra minute to the cooking time and it comes out perfect. The only negative is that this rice as way too much salt. There is around 1800 mg of salt in the whole package, and I usually end up eating the whole pouch as a meal. If they would just reduce the sodium, I would be eating this way more often. Regardless, I give this product a thumbs up for the great taste!"
SPIKE this with some Irish cream liqueur,"yes, this is flavored coffee already...but, it's a great base for some spiked refreshment.  i like Carolans or Baileys, but Saint Brendans works well too.  be sure you use a tall cup so you have room for the extra spirits. what could possibly go wrong with that! i'm signing up for a subscription with free shipping."
Gourmet tea sampler,"The Blue Eyes herbal mix has an unexpectedly strong but delightful flavor; the Darjeeling is acceptable if undistinguished; The Yerba Mate and the African Red Bush are only for the brave (sort of a boiled tree bark flavor); and the green teas are, well, green teas ('nuff said)."
Simply the best!,"I love brittle, and let me say this - this brittle is THE BEST I've ever had.  It is made with milk - I think most other brittles are made with water.  The brittle itself is somewhat opaque and absolutely fantastic.  I would order this stuff without the peanuts, just the brittle, if it was sold that way - it is that good.  It is somewhat less hard and at the same time actually more ""brittle"" than other peanut brittles.  Did I say that it is really fantastic?  I tell you, if I lived out West, I would be 20lbs heavier because of this stuff."
LOVE IT!,This is by far one of the best k-cups I've tried.  It smells and tastes like coconut with no weird after taste.  I use hazelnut creamer with it and it's my absolute favorite coffee drink.  I'm not sure how long it's available since it's seasonal so i'm definitely stocking up!
A nice smooth change up,"As someone who tries to stay away from drinks with sugar, the flavor options for mixed powders gets pretty redundant. This is a fresh new flavor that isn't too bitter/acidic and can be consumed as a regular drink, or mixes well for low calorie adult beverages!<br /><br />The flavor could be a bit stronger, which is why I rated it a 4 star instead of 5, but that also makes it more drinkable as a regular daytime drink as well. As far as a Margarita goes, it's pretty accurate in my opinion.  I enjoy the variety and really appreciated a fresh flavor from your typical berry/lemon/ade/grape flavors that fill the shelves everywhere."
Perfect!,"I ordered this online for a coworker who loves chocolate. The basket arrived very fast, was packed great, and the presentation and variety in the basket was the best! If you are looking for a great chocolate gift basket...I recommend this one."
MUST TRY,"I received these as a gift and they are decadent, smooth and creamy. Must be tried to fully appreciate!"
Pink Himalayan Course Grain Salt,"I use this Pink Himalayan course grain salt in salt grinders because it looks great, but also I make my own homemade Herbal Salt using Rosemary, Lemon Thyme and Pink Himalayan course grain salt...tastes great and look great in the grinders and shakers.  I've very satisfied.  I plan on making up some more Herbal Salts for Christmas gifts using this Pink Himalayan salt.  Very satisfied!"
Great Ketchup!,"Awesome Ketchup!  Just the right temperature for me.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to add a little spice to their foods.  Great with burgers, fries, hashbrowns, etc.  Recommend buying to anyone!"
Soft chocolatey goodness,"The cookies are a chocolate lovers dream as they are filled with soft, ooey, gooey chocolatey goodness. For chocolate lovers you will love this cookie.<br /><br />Recommend."
"Makes a Nice, Rich Cup of Coffee","Some reviewers say you can't teabag these pods, because the coffee will be week. However, if you put the pod in a cup, pour boiling water over it, then set a spoon on top of the pod, so it doesn't float to the top, leave it in the cup for about twenty seconds or so, then use two spoons and gently squeeze the pod over the coffee cup, voila, you get a nice, rich cup of coffee."
Best ever,After buying this lemongrass green tea I have become spoiled.  I won't drink any other kind of tea.  The taste is exceptionally good.
Sweet carbonated juice,"The Switch Kiwi Berry drink is good tasting and all natural.  It should be emphasized that it is full-strength juice, not a ""flavored water"" type product.  For that reason, I found it a bit strong because I am not accustomed to drinking much juice.  The carbonation does add a bit of lightness to it though.  I like that it didn't taste too artificial."
Delicious and satisfying,"Not greasy, not salty, not dry (like baked chips), and the best part..don't have to eat the whole bag to feel satisfied.  I'm sold!"
Snap into the SlimJim!!,"Excellant product, been hooked on the stuff for decades. I wouldn't change a thing on them, except maybe make them have a longer shelf life"
Very poor quality,I have been eating licorice for over 60 years. This licorice is more like candy. I should have known that  you cant buy this much  licorice for $16.00. I could not recommend this unless you just want candy.
Udon noodles.,These were ok.  I like a stronger tasting sauce.  Definitely like when they are not fried - therefore not all the fat.
Keeps them busy,"My dogs enjoy chewing this and chasing the smaller one around like a ball.  It keeps them busy longer than most treats, which is very important for a Golden Doodle.  If you have one, you know what I mean!"
Child favorites,"My children love these, specially with sharp cheddar and turkey on top. They have also tried them in many different dips and one of their favorite methods is flavored cream cheese spread. Pretty much every creative thing they have come up with to use these crackers with has ended up delicious. So I would have to say its a pretty good universal little cracker/pretzel"
Agave caramel,This stuff was so good.  The only bad thing about that was that I couldn't stop eating it.  Next time I will have to have a better control.
The real deal!,"I was shocked to find these on Amazon! I stock up on this very brand every summer when we go to Michigan & paid $24 for them in a Northern Michigan grocery store just a few weeks ago. I think I'll just subscribe & save big from now on! These cherries are awesome, absolutely the real deal from the Cherry Capitol of the World, Traverse City Michigan. LOVE MICHIGAN !!"
Quite a rich flavor,"These microwavable meals that don't require refrigeration are very convenient, although these Compleats are not quite as convenient as the Chef Boyardee products, where you simply need to remove the cover before heating.<br /><br />These are very light snacks, at just 10oz.  That may or may not be what you want.  I find I need to heat them for 2 minutes, rather than the recommended 90 seconds.  This particular variety has a somewhat spicy taste, due to the peppers it contains.  It has a rather unappetizing, muddy appearance.  You also need to stir it before eating.<br /><br />If you use convenience meals like this every day at work, then you need some variety.  This one is worth a try, especially if you are looking for something with a fuller flavor than most chicken meals."
great for dogs that love to chew!,"My dogs just aren't into the plastic bones and other chew toys - but they love the cow hooves!  This pack of 10 contains hooves that are thicker than I have seen other places, which is important because they are less prone to splitting and chipping.  You do have to watch your dog when they are chewing, in case a piece breaks off, but this is the only product that I have found that my dogs love.  I have two labs, one is an agressive chewer, and if we have the hooves around I don't worry about her chewing something she shouldn't (my shoes!).  I do have to warn you that the smell isn't great when they chew it for a while, but its worth it for them to be happy.  I would absolutely reccommend this product to anyone with a dog!"
A celiac parent's savior,"As a parent of a child who was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease, you might imagine the stress associated with informing your child he can no longer have one of his favorite meals - mac and cheese.  That was until we discovered these canisters!!!  These are our savior and the ability to buy them separate and in bulk is exactly what we needed.  They arrived on time and in the expected condition. They are easy to use (they have a resealable top) so we get great mileage out of them.  We will be buying them for years to come!!"
Just started and cats like them!,"I'll report back with results, but for now my five year old calico and three year old orange tabby like them a lot. Be sure to feed only one a day. I fed my cat two by accident and she spit up the second."
A great little snack!,I ordered these lollipops as a low-cal treat for myself to help curb night-time eating.  I figured they would occupy my mouth without filling me with high fructose corn syrup.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the lollipops were just as tasty as described in previous reviews.  The fruit flavors are very refreshing and not overly sweet.  I will definitely be reordering once I've finished with this batch!
Best Hot Cocoa,"This is the best hot cocoa I've ever had and is very hard-to-find in NE. The only place I've ever seen it in stores, is at a Stop-N-Shop in NJ."
Great Product!  Fooled the cats again!!,"For those cats that think they are pigs, this mat works great.  No longer can they succeed with getting their food and water all over the floor within minutes of me getting their mess cleaned up.  I know it spoils their fun to no longer be able to watch the water run across the floor after the joy of seeing it bubble out of the container and then push food into it just to watch it swell up, but my time is more valuable than theirs...at least to me.  Also, the mat does not scoot easily so they cannot drag it...oops, spoiled another one of their games!"
Happy 5-yr-old w/ Food Allergies,"My 5-year-old son has multiple food allergies.  He LOVES these cookies!  It is great for him to be able to take snacks to school that he can enjoy!  I have eaten them, too.  And they are actually good!  I was feeling a little nauseous, and it only took a few to settle the feeling. I am glad we have found these great treats!"
Wonderful!,This made my milk production go way up! The taste is strong but with some honey it is great. It will make you smell like maple syrup so don't freak out. My husband actually kind of liked it!
3 words,"""CANDY LOVER'S ""CRACK""""  THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!!!!!!I DON'T EVEN MIND PAYING $3 A TIN FOR IT."
Good price top quality,"We use coconut oil instead of butter and shortening for baking and on the table.<br />This is one of the best for texture and taste.<br />The price is very good, and the delivery fast."
Each to their own...,"I am a fan of the Newman's Own company, and its philanthropic mission. Some of their products are quite good, such as their spaghetti sauce and oreo-type cookies. This chocolate bar was not quite what I anticipated - sweeter and more buttery than I expect from a premium dark chocolate bar. The flavor does not linger on the palate and each square seems ""over"" far too soon.  Still, one thing I've learned from reading and writing reviews on Amazon is that there's an enthusiastic audience for just about anything, so I'm sure other folks will enjoy this more than I did.  Still, I think Newman's would do well to butch this bar up a bit, and let those with sweet tooths go for their milk chocolate instead.  Each to their own, I suppose."
I'm so happy to see these on Amazon!,"Warning, they DO NOT taste like hot dogs. They are merely shaped like hot dogs. I grew up with these and hear they are a bit of an acquired taste. (One of my friends didn't like them at first but I stubbornly kept feeding them to her. Finally she admitted, ""They grow on you...like mold."" And now she wants Big Franks whenever we see each other.) Wonderful cut up, fried, and added to omelets, diced potatoes, or macaroni. Shred them, mix with mayo, and have a tuna sandwich substitute. Or just eat them like hot dogs.<br /><br />I just about had a happygasm when I found Loma Linda products on Amazon. I live overseas with the military and, as you can guess, it's difficult to find my childhood foods here."
Excellent product.,This cereal blows away anything you can buy is the local supermarket. It tastes great and is not to sweet. Tastes good hot or cold. It has no artificial ingredients in it and is full of nuts and fruit. Highly recommend it.
JackLink's IS AWESOME,"We used to buy Jack Link's Beef sticks from stores at a cost of 2/$1.00.... since I found where to order them online, I now pay about 33cents each!  What a savings!  And, Amazon saves my info so when I need to order more, it's right there and easy to order.  Now, if I can just keep the rest of the family away from them, the 72 stick order might last more than 10 days!"
Very nice Cheeries,"Dried Cherries are very tasty, set it to deliver every two month at first, just to<br />try it out, right now I need to make it deliver every month.  Yes, it is good."
Best Chew Ever,I purchased this chew for my dog and was very pleased.  She loved it immediately and wouldn't put it down for hours.  I know that they are expensive but they last 10 times longer than any raw hide and are completely safe and natural. I definately recommend this product.
"Full bodied, strong fruity aroma, excellent Sicilian oil","Today I tried this oil for the first time, and I am swished away by its wonderful fruitiness. What a great aroma! Unbelievable!<br /><br />I had toasted bread slices which I rubbed with a raw clove of garlic, the toasted bread works like a grater here. I use it very generously, so one clove lasts only for 2 slices in my household. Upon this prepared bread I am putting only the best olive oils.<br /><br />I am changing them, actually. I had started this kind of breakfast some weeks ago, and so far we had used some milder oil from Tuscany. Now it was time to try one of our newly ordered Gustiamo oils, and I went with this one, as their blog post about it and the man behind it had made me already curious.<br /><br />This guy is my kind of guy, I am of a similar mindset and no less cynical than he is. Organic labels have become useless, since every industrial corporation can plaster their garbage products with them nowadays. DOP in Italy is no longer a garantee for outstanding quality. So why bother and run with the masses, why spending much money to get such a useless label on your product? As long as you know your product is outstanding and great, you will be able to convince your customers, with DOP labels or not.<br /><br />His oil is indeed outstanding! Good that I bought 2 bottles of it.<br /><br />Strong flavour, green, tart and fruity at the same time. Could I mention I was reminded of citrus? There are certainly no flavours added, I only felt a hint of citrus in the aroma and the rich full bodied taste. I will definitely re-order this Queen of Sicilian oils!"
Nice style,"I bought this after seeing Alton Brown use it on TV.  It's just as I expected.  Very stylish and fits into my stainless steel kitchen very nicely.  Love it.<br /><br />Pros: good looks, very solid product<br />Cons: none"
"Terrible! Washed-out, tasteless, not coffee!","First time I decided to try this out. For Kona the price is great of course, and the freshly opened bag is fragrant, and yet it's one of those ""you get what you pay for"" situations (except here you get much LESS than you paid for): the brew barely tastes like coffee (even with five teaspoons to a small cup it still tastes like boiled cardboard). You will buy a better coffee in a supermarket; any kind you pick will be better and cost about the same. Bottom line: not recommended (I won't reorder).<br /><br />***<br />05/07/2012: I'm so pissed I paid for this crap, I'm trying to get a refund. The ground matter itself, when dry, smells nice, but the brew... you could brew sawdust with the same exact result. No taste, no aroma, no caffeine kick, no matter how much you use per cup. Black sludgewater. Horrible, and should be against the law to sell it. The only use for this junk I can see is to sprinkle it around the house dry -- 'cause it smells nice while dry. This product is a quintessential ripoff; stay away.<br /><br />05/14/2012: Sent it back and just got a refund. Whew! So that's that. At least I can thank them and Amz for the complete lack of hassle with returns."
So good!,"These are crunchy and very tasty!  These don't taste like the 'usual' chips from the store.  When I first tried them, I could tell right away they were different from the greasy, salty, fatty chips I was used to eating.  These have their own flavor and crunch and I started to appreciate them right away.  I noticed I didn't feel so sluggish and icky after eating these.  Which was wonderful.  The combo package is great because the flavors are all very different and tasty.  And I love the smaller packages.  They really hit the spot without the risk of overindulging."
Even good in bags!,"I've always thought Dilmah was superb loose, but I ordered bags this time to distribute to my family, who aren't willing to cope with loose tea (can't spare the extra 30 seconds, I suppose).  These bags don't have any noticeable effect upon the flavour and are quite convenient.<br /><br />Wonderful, reasonably priced tea!  Also, read the company founder's insert, now in slightly less bizarre English, for an enjoyable rant on ethical teas."
Nice Green Iced Tea Beverage,If you like the flavor of green tea and like your beverage iced you will enjoy this beverage.<br /><br />I like the taste of green tea and I also like the health benefits of green tea.  I mix this with ice water and splenda.  It is a refreshing summer beverage.  I like that it dissolves easily and is packaged in small packages.  It is convenient and easy to use.
No surprises here,"Ordered and received the product without a hitch.  Great for your dogs, so I buy in bulk."
Wonderful overall,"A few years ago, my 5 year old cat abruptly decided that he hated the cat food I had him on.  While I was standing in the store, trying to decide which he might like better, I foolishly made the mistake of reading the ingredient lists.  Now, I'm not a fanatic, and I'm not about to put my cat on a raw diet or anything like that, but I'd read these lists of grains and chemicals and oh, yeah, some minor chicken parts, and it just seemed wrong.  Cats are obligate carnivores, and more to the point, I suppose, why was I feeding him something that looked like the nutritional equivalent of Cheetos?<br /><br />I found an excellent brand at the time which of course went out of business within 2 months, and then I tried a couple of the fancier brands out there.  He was on Evo for a bit, and liked it well enough, but to avoid issues if they suddenly decided to go out of business, I was trying a few other brands as well, and impulse bought this one.  When I ripped open the bag, it of course split and spilled all over the floor.  He chased down and ate every. single. piece.  And i knew we'd found a new primary catfood.<br /><br />He's been on it for 4 years now, and his coat is great, his weight is steady, and the catbox is a LOT easier to clean. (Well, except that I also bought him a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063446M"">Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain</a> which he adores and drinks masses more water with than a water bowl, but those things balance out, right?) He also throws up a lot less, always a blessing.<br /><br />For people who are unsure about the cost, as I was to begin with when I switched my cat to a better quality diet, something to consider is that they eat less on a higher quality diet, and they process more of it.  So while the bag of food was twice the cost of a grocery store brand, he finished it off in more than twice as long.  He takes about 3 months to eat through this bag of food, and he free eats about 2/3 a cup a day.  He'd probably like it better if I feed him from smaller bags because the fish oil in the food will age badly over time (though I keep it in a sealed container once open), but a house with multiple cats won't have that problem (and let me repeat, for the houses with multiple cats: The catbox is much improved.)<br /><br />I haven't tried the pork variety, but he HATED the fish variety, and I couldn't blame him--it was uberstinky.  But tastes vary between cats, so the friend I gave it to had no complaints from his cats."
YUMMY!,"If you like spicy snack food, this is it.  I love this product.  My favorite is the ketchup fries.  I tried the buffalo one and Wow!  Too hot, but good.  The regular ones are good.  My store will not stock up on these so I'm buying here.  These are REAL tasty.  Will buy again.  Also, they don't weight you down.  They are light and no trans fats.  Yum!"
GREAT PRICE FOR DIABETICS,"I AM DIABETIC AND THE WORLD MAKES IT VERY EXPENSIVE TO HAVE THIS DISEASE.  THIS IS JUST ONE PLACE WE CAN SAVE  A LITTLE, THANX SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Fantastic pretzels!,These pretzels are fantastic!  It didn't take us long to consume all 12 boxes.  They are (were) delicious!
Superior flavor,"As other reviewers noted, these have more butterscotch flavor than another leading brand, which does end up being more sweet/waxy.  These are great in pumpkin chocolate/butterscotch chip muffins.  I'll get them again."
Threw them out.,"I adore sardines.  I'm used to the Bela brand, but decided to try these for variety's sake.  I opened up a can and it smelled like nasty cat food.  I tasted them anyway, but was totally grossed out.  In the trash it went.  Stick with Bela, super clean flavor, fresh and better sourced.  Totally different food product.  Try them with Siracha."
Our pet loves greenies,"Our pet loves having greenies as treat, she gets crazy every time she hears or see us opening the package. Her breath also gets better after eating her treat."
Excellent starter set.,"What a wonderful starter kit this is.  While I am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts, I certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time.  Tather than chance buying a product that I did not like and being stuck with it, this allowed me to give each and everyone a try.<br /><br />I plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that, like me, are foodies.<br /><br />This is an excellent product."
Review of favorite sandwich break mix.,"This is truly a ""favorite"" of mine.  It makes a wonderful gluten free sandwich bread.  I have used it in a bread machine and also made it ""by hand"" in a regular oven.  It is easy to use and comes out great every time."
Excellent Product,"If you love quinoa, as I do, you will be pleased with this product.  The problem with the quinoa I have been able to purchase in local outlets is that it has to be washed, which is a major nuisance.  This product is prewashed and very simple to prepare.<br /><br />I frequently make up a big batch and keep it in the refrigerator to use as needed.  It makes a quick and healthy alternative to the potatoes, pasta, or white rice I prepare for my husband.  When I want to add something, usually spinach or onion and peppers, I simply saute it as needed and add the prepared quinoa."
Decent instant coffee,"I like Bru instant coffee. I am not sure what the effect of the chicory is, but it tastes different from Nescafe, more like South Indian-style filter coffee. There are cheaper places than Amazon to get it though. Be sure to check out a local ethnic Indian grocery store."
Antioxidant Refresher,"****<br /><br />This Pomegranate Green Tea from Yogi Tea is an antioxidant refresher. It's an all natural tea made from organic green tea leaf, organic hibiscus flowers, organic flavors, organic peppermint leaf, pomegranate juice powder, stevia leaf, organic burdock root, and organic dandelion root. The taste is mild, only very slightly tasting of pomegranate, tasting mostly just of green tea, with a very pleasant aroma; in fact, it's so mild, that I would definitely use two tea bags and brew it for the full six minutes. It does not get bitter. Unless you enjoy very mild tea, you should plan on getting fewer cups of tea from the box. For this reason I gave this tea only four stars.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Pomegranate Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Pomegranate helps reinvigorate the body through the neutralization of harmful free radicals. Delicious Pomegranate provides this tea with a powerful dose of natural antioxidants and exciting fruit flavor. This cherished fruit contains polyphenols, chemical compounds that include Epigallo-catechin-3 gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that is nearly 100 times more potent than vitamin C and 25 times more potent than vitamin E. A favorite of the Mediterranean peoples for centuries, Pomegranate has also been linked to nourishing the skin, supporting healthy cholesterol levels already in the normal range and promoting cardiovascular health. Like Pomegranate, Organic Green Tea also supplies polyphenols that help ward off free radicals. In fact, a single cup of Green Tea has been shown to provide greater antioxidant support than a serving of broccoli, spinach or strawberries. To further complement this healing formula, we've included the detoxifying qualities of Organic Burdock and Organic Dandelion, as well as the gentle essence of Organic Peppermint. Enjoy a cup of refreshing Green Tea Pomegranate and feel renewed with the benefits of nature's most powerful antioxidants.""<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Pomegranate Green Tea has contains approximately 30 mg of caffeine per tea bag, which is just one third of what is normally found in an 8 oz cup of coffee.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting. Recommended.<br /><br />****"
Disappointed...,I will have to experiment with the mix. I guess you get used to the taste!
From Great to So-So,"These used to be my favorite bars from any brand. The company changed the recipe, and now I am really disappointed with the taste. I'm going to cancel my order subscription or reduce it."
Getcha SOME!,"We have an in home cinema...so we have to have a floor standing popcorn maker.  When we have guest we like to make it a real even with ""MOVIE"" popcorn and Little Popper does just that.  I love the flavor and the convenience of the package that is premeasured for the perfect pop.  I do add just 1/2 of the salt while popping and the remaining salt I have placed in a shaker for those that like more.  If you are looking for that ""MOVIE"" butter flavor this is the one!"
Really Great Snack...Not sure what others are talking about???,"My review is for the Triple Berry Crunch granola in the 12 oz bag.  I had not tried this particular flavor before but had tried the Fruit and Nut variety in a free sample.  I was looking online to purchase the Fruit and Nut and found the Triple Berry which had less fat and calories and so I bought that instead.  At Amazon's subscribe savings plus the current discount, the cost is less than $3 a bag which is great!  This product tastes great, has a great texture, and is great to take along in little zip loc bags for a snack.  My children ask for it and eat it by the handfull.  I've since gone back and ordered more of the other flavors of this granola.  The company has a website with all their nutrition information listed so you can check all that out and compare flavors in detail before you decide.  My only somewhat negative comment about this product is that I wish it had a few more berries in it (what couldn't use more berries??) and that it came in more of a cluster form so my toddlers could eat it a little easier.  We've not experienced any of the tasteless choke and gagging that others have mentioned, nor did I find the product to be overly priced as someone else had said.  In fact, we've found quite the opposite and will be stocking this product and other flavors of it on a regular basis."
"not great, weak dark chocolate.","This is let down flavor, too much mints, very little chocolate. Regret buying this, stuff like that should stick with grocery.."
V8 is not vegetarian,"Vegetarians and vegans need to avoid this product.  ""The term ""flavoring"" refers to the oils or extracts that are obtained from spices and herbs. Natural flavoring may also include onion or garlic derivatives, as well as flavor derived from fruits, vegetables and their juices, or edible parts of plants. Other sources may include meat, seafood, poultry or dairy products, whose significant function in the food is flavoring rather than nutrition."""
Mama does it again,"Okay, I loved this pizza crust!  It was thicker than most pizza crust.  Reminded me of homemade crust my mom used to make.  Loved it!  Thank you for bringing pizza back into my life."
Organic Oatmeal Delicious and Healthy,"Just the right size, great price.<br />A great start for the morning.<br />It is sweet but just right.<br />Nice consistency and with Flax seeds.<br />Very Healthy."
Pop Chips - Better tasting and Better for you than regular chips,"These are better than any low calorie chips I've ever had, and I prefer them to normal chips. They are wonderful. Oprah even loves them.  I would buy this box again, and probably will, because I LOVE that these are 100 calorie packs. The barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are AWESOME."
MAKES GREAT PANCAKES,"IT IS HARD FINDING SIMILAR PRODUCTS FOR OUR GLUTEN FREE CHILD, FOR THINGS SHE LOVED BEFORE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CELIAC DISEASE.  THIS IS A MIX THAT SHE LOVES FOR PANCAKES.  SHE EVEN MADE SWEET POTATO BISCUITS YESTERDAY WITH IT. WE HAVE FOUND IT ON SALE FOR $1.79 PER BOX AT OUR LOCAL GROCERY STORE (LESS THAN AMAZON A FEW TIMES,) SO WE STOCK UP WHEN IT IS ON SALE.  IT WILL BE NICE WHEN GLUTEN FREE FOODS ARE PRICED MORE CLOSELY TO THE WHEAT MIXES.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOU.  WE WILL TRY MANY MORE RECIPIES USING THIS PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
"Not all that ""special"" but kids love it","Every kid who has tried these bars absolutely love them and no wonder - they are not ""special"" as in ""healthy"" by any stretch of the imagination.  They are full of sugar and other non-nutritional ingredients. They also do not provide much in the way of sustenance for very long. I would give these 5 stars for the kid approval and 2 stars for the nutrional value but only a 3 for value."
Skippy Dipping!,"I love SKIPPY Peanut Butter, especially SKIPPY Creamy peanut butter, but the one thing I find so hard to believe is why Amazon has to charge almost $10 just to buy 1 40 OZ jar of SKIPPY when you can get the same exact brand & size for under $9 bucks at the grocery and/or retail store, but I guess Amazon figures that they can get away with it if somebody wants the product bad enough and doesn't want to have to bother getting out and over to the store.<br /><br />Another thing that I have a hard time comprehending is why Amazon sells SKIPPY and JIF in a 40 Ounce size jar individually, but wont sell PETER PAN in a 40 OZ jar individually and only let you buy the 40 OZ jars and 28 OZ jars in a multiple packet of 3 or more and will only sell PETER PAN individually in a 16 OZ jar or 28 OZ jar only, but apparently it may be due to SKIPPY having a higher demand in more options and perhaps SKIPPY and JIF outsells PETER PAN.<br /><br />Overall, SKIPPY was one of my favorite peanut butters growing up, especially in my childhood years when my mother was trying to watch how much sugar I ate in my diet since they say SKIPPY only has 1/3 less sugar than most other peanut butters."
"My son wasn't ""spitting up"" he was ""throwing up""","My son, who is now 4 months old, starting spitting up the regular enfamil lipil around 1 month old, and soon after that he began to throw up all most everything he ate. A friend of mine told me about the enfamil a.r. and of course I had to try it. Since that day my son has not thrown up once. He still does spit up, but it now the normal baby amount. I would tell any one to buy this formula!"
I normally Love Larabars but the jocalat was gross.,"I normally love Larabars. I have tried a few favors and have loved them all but there is something really off about the Jocalat bar. They were dried out and when you tried to take a bit out of the bar it crumbed. The box said they were good until Jan 2012 but they tasted old, dried out, just plan gross. I am not sure if this a bad box or if larabar company needs to redo their bar flavor.Bad product!!!"
Are my three dogs too pickey?,"I have three dogs.  Two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls.  The third one (a Yorkie), has always been pickey. For the past couple years I had been buying those expensive brands of food that promise ""natural ingredients and better health"". I decided to try Newman's Own.  None of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food (no disrespect to the late Mr. Newman).  If I mix Newman's Own with another brand, the dogs make an effort to pick out (eat) the ""other"" food and they will tend to leave Newman's Own in the bowl.  If they are hungry and nothing else is available, they will eat the Newman's Own. I am not here to ""knock"" Newman's Own.  I am simply telling you my experience. BTW: The food is not old. It does not smell stale or old."
My daughter loves these,My 11 month old loves these melts - she's been eating them since she was about 7 months old.  The only problem - not really a problem just an observation - is that once her fingers get wet the melts tend to stick to them and she has some difficulty getting them from her fingers to her mouth - she generally ends up with several stuck to her head and behind her ears (not unlike the rest of her food I suppose).  She also likes the berry flavors - I think they're pretty tasty too but all the other adults who've taste-tested found them foul.  Oh well.
love this coffee.,this is the best coffee. I've tried many k cup coffees and this one is the best one that i have found so far.
Doesn't taste Great to my baby!,I ordered this item as I got to see it as recommended by Dr.Sears.. But the pack of 6 with this flavor doesn't work for my baby... My baby didn't like the taste.. I don't know why :(.. Had it been packed with different flavors.. I would have atleast tried the other flavor... As this item is not eligible for returns.. I am just wondering what to do with this...
Great for chocoholics,"These cookie-cakes are pretty darn good and chocolatey. A bit too sweet for my taste because of the marshmellow layer doesn't prevent me from scarfing down a few, and I do so guilt-free. Kids should love these since they taste like pure junk food, and I mean that as a compliment. Hard to believe they have zero fat."
Mushrooms,"I love mushrooms, peas and curry.  I can't cook.  This is an okay alternative.  These meals last for years in your pantry."
Good Stuff,"Pero is a good drink mix.  I wouldn't call it ""coffee substitute"" but it's a good drink in it's own right.  I do like the ""dark roast"" version of it best though."
Natural foods,I am very satisfied with this product.  I would purchase this item again. I did not give it 5 stars because I am not so knowledgeable on Maple Syrups to know if it is the best out there.
Smooth flavor and balanced energy,"Although I enjoy its flavor, I have never been able to drink coffee because it makes me feel jittery and nervous instead of energetic. Guayusa tea, on the other hand, is a different story, full of pleasure only. Drinking one or two cups of guayusa in the morning gives me energy all day long, without any buzz or jittery feeling. The flavor of this tea is also smooth and sweet, with perfectly balanced hints of cinnamon and lemongrass. It tastes nice hot but I find that I like it best cold."
"""The Batch: is VERY VERY Good!!!","I've been using Batch #37 (""The Batch"") for YEARS and it is hands down my favorite hot sauce. I recall when I first stumbled upon The Batch I thought it was so good that I went out and ordered all the Pain Is Good hot sauces to give them a try. Some were good, some were crap but none compared to The Batch.<br />If you like hot hot sauce, you must try The Batch. It is the perfect balance of flavor and heat. Many of the really hot sauces are so hot they lose any and all of their flavor. Supermarket hot sauces on the other hand, often times have decent flavor but very little heat.<br />I eat The Batch to spice up salsa, straight on tortilla chips or whatever needs a little kick...I recently added a few drops to some cocktail sauce for dipping shrimp and it was amazing!!! Before it was available on Amazon, I would literally buy it by the case directly from the folks at Pain Is Good and give half the bottles away as gifts.<br />WARNING: DO NOT give it to people that do not openly volunteer their love of hot sauces as they usually can't take the heat...literally.<br />Now go get some Batch #37 and enjoy!!!"
Horrible taste! Do not waste your money!,"I am a huge fan of the Celsius drinks, I have converted some of my coworkers from regular energy drinks to Celsius. I was excited to try the stevia version. I have 11 can left that I will end up throwing a way. The taste is horrible! It taste like bitter medicine. Stick with the original."
A Half the cans were dented & 3 of them weren't sealed,"I didn't look at the case of dog food when it arrived too carefully.  When I started to feed it to my dog I found that half of the cans were dented.  Not a big deal, at least not until I got to the cans that were dented so badly that they had lost the seal.  It was all moldy at the top and I had to throw those ones out.  My dog does love this, but then he loves all canned food I have given him.  I bought this because it is one of very few canned dog foods that are meant for puppies, and it was one of the most affordable ones too.  I was disappointed that the food comes all ground up in a paste.  Some of the adult Purina canned foods have actual pieces of meat and rice that you can see (there is usually a picture of what it looks like on the back).  I have also read up on some of the ingredients here and I am going to switch to another brand with better ingredients and with ingredients that I can actually see, even if it means feeding my dog an adult formula.  Purina isn't bad, but if you can afford to spend a little more there are much better brands out there."
Pros and cons...,"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />""Where is it?""<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning."
"vanilla nut creme black tea, decaf",I really enjoy this tea at night as a substitute to camomile.  It's decaf so I don't have to worry about staying up too late.
These are so great!,"Greenie pill pockets are the best things for giving pets pills.  I was using them for my dog that needed to take arthritis meds daily, and he would gobble them down like a treat.  When I had to start giving one of my cats pills, I decided to try them, and low and behold, the cats love them too!  What an easy way to give your pets pills!  I will never again try to give pills without these... they save so much stress and time.  The dog and cat pockets are the same, it's just a matter of the size.  If the pills are small, just use the feline pockets, there are more in the package for the same price."
Disappointing on a number of levels,"My wife and I independently taste-tested this product. My wife is a regular consumer of dark chocolates while I tend to prefer milk chocolate, and/or chocolates with fillings. After trying it out, we both decided that we would not purchase this product in the future, though for different reasons. Here are our independent reviews:<br /><br />My wife: I am confused by the labeling of this product. It is called a 'dark chocolate' but has a 54% cacao content. Most dark chocolates that I buy have upwards of 65% - 75% cacao. When I first opened the package, I noticed a smoky aroma. I eat a lot of dark chocolate, including raw chocolate, but I never noticed such a smoky aroma before and found it pleasant. My first bite was disappointing. It is a bit too sweet for me, and is certainly significantly sweeter than the dark chocolates that I buy. It is smooth, which I like. While I appreciate the fact that Newman's own is producing an organic, minimally processed, chocolate I will not purchase this again.<br /><br />Me: From my first bite I knew that this chocolate was not for me. It had a distinctly waxy feel that I usually associate with inferior chocolates - this was an immediate turnoff. There was absolutely nothing distinctive about this chocolate - no fruity notes, no particular bitterness, nothing that sticks out. While this chocolate is better than a lot of what constitutes the mass market, I cannot recommend it."
13 Varieties But Old Holiday Flavors & Inconsistent # Per Variety,"This was my first order of k-cups and I was looking to try various types of flavored coffees.  In a 34 cup variety pack, I received 13 different flavors from 4 roasters.  While the overall variety was nice, the # of cups per variety varied:  1 cup for 4 different flavors, 2 cups for 4 different flavors; 3 cups for 1 flavor; 4 cups for 2 flavors; 5 cups for 1 flavor; and 6 cups for 1 flavor.  I'm a bit disappointed in the # of cups per flavor wasn't more consistent as both my husband and I wanted to try each flavor we received.  Also, I suspect that some of the cups may be old as the 14 of the 34 cups are holiday flavors from past holidays last year (it's June 2012 and I rec'd 4 cups each of spicy eggnog & gingerbread and 6 cups of pumpkin spice)."
Guilt Free Pleasure,So delicious.  Just the right amount of sea salt. Very satisfying. There are 2 servings in a bag and I usually only eat 1 serving!  They are very filling.
Has the formula changed?,Not a bad snack. The kids love them. Great for camping and school...but has the formula changed? THey are pretty greasy! Fatty. salty? Hm...
EVERYBODY LOVES MEAT MAGIC ON PORK TENDERLOINS,"This seasoning is fantastic rubbed on pork tenderloins.  Add grated lime rind, juice and sliced lime, marinated for half a day in the fridge.  Grill on high heat just until medium-rare with a pink center.  Sliced into medallions and serve with a brown sauce with tablespoon of ginger-teriaki dressing mixed in. Steve Polino - Winter Park. FL"
Best tomato puree ever,"I have been using this product for many years. It makes the best sauce ever.  We use it plain a lot as I have food allergies and it tastes great plain.<br /><br />The problem I have with ordering from Amazon for this product ONLY is that most of the cans arrive dented.  Amazon is great and sent me another shipment for free.<br />However that shipment had dented cans also!<br /><br />I recommend this product highly, just not ordering it from Amazon!"
k-cups,great product for the price i ended up getting two i had a 20 dollar gift certificate and it came out to like 24 dollars so great buy and value.
Highly variable quality,"I've purchased this item twice.  The first delivery was excellent in all respects.  The sun-dried tomatoes looked and smelled great, and they tasted even better - I ate many of them straight from the bag.  Unfortunately I re-ordered and the second shipment was awful.  The tomatoes were over-dried, dark brown in color, and smelled burned.  Worst of all they tasted horrible in everything I've tried to use them in so far.  Honestly I think I'll probably throw away the rest before I have to throw away any more dinners prepared with these.  A huge disappointment after my initial impression, and due to the cost of a 5 lb. bag."
Okay but not Cake Mate,"I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon."
Dangerously delicious,"Heed my advice!  When you go to eat this, measure out your portion, seal the bag and put it under a timed lock.  It's a pretty high calorie snack and terribly, terribly delicious and I think I got about 3 servings out of the bag instead of the...you know...10...it's really got in there.<br /><br />Also, bring a spoon.  I think the concept is finger-food with chunks of granola but in the end there's a lot of loose granola lying around.  I also wish it had more of the dried berries... also note that it's not ""chocolate infused granola"" but rather, granola clusters with small chunks of chocolate scattered throughout the mix.  My first bite was like ""eh...not much chocolate taste here"" but I didn't realize the chunks of chocolate were in there separately.<br /><br />It's a great mix and a tasty snack and you'll be awfully tempted to eat the whole bag in one go, which is probably not the greatest idea."
Perfect,These replaced a prescription medication I was taking for incontinence and they work at least as well.  The pumpkin can give me a stomachache but I'm thinking that will go away and to make sure I take it with food.  No side effects of any consequence.  And MUCH safer than artifical drugs.
excellent,seattle is the best coffee. and the flavor cinnabon is great. anyone please try it.
Great Northern Popcorn,I serve this popcorn to my guests and they can't get over how much taste it has. Not to much salt nor not to much oil. It tastes so fresh. It is always served as part of our appetizers when entertaining. We even have people that use the pool adjacent to our home yell at me to 'bring popcorn'. The free shipping is very nice. The discount for setting up automatic shipments is a nice perk. We have purchase at least 4 cases since we bought the Roosevelt popcorn maker and the cart. It is a nice addition to our family room.
Good for Low Cal Snack,"I am always dieting and ordered the multi flavor package of these.  I admit I like some flavors more than others.  At first I wasn't sure I liked them because they are so light and airy but they are filling and only 110 calories, 2grams fat, 1g fiber. A filling, crunchy snack bagb you can keep in a desk or in the car that won't wreck a diet but is emotionally satisfying if you need a saltry crunch.  I didn't think I would like the vinegar ones, but I really do.  The sligtly salty ones are the least flavorful in my opinion but sometimes I use dip with them. I will definitely order again.  The bagsv are big and sometimes I only need to eat half to feel satisfied, honestly. (Not like the PopC**ps where I can eat a whole ig bag) Wish I could get them in stores. They grow on you and for me they were worth the money to stay on my diet."
Great,These are great for the HCG diet. Theyre really yummy and came fast and well packaged. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
My Favorite,Happy Squeeze Pumpkin is my absolute favorite snack to have during the day. It has to be refrigerated for the best flavor. I also reach for these when a need a quick snack late at night but do not want something heavy. Plus it is only 90 calories!
Numi is #1 with Me,I adore Numi teas! They are usually organic and well priced at Amazon. Much better than a lot of the teas sold here.
A Calming Experience,This is a great tea.  I like to drink it in the afternoon at work.  It helps to relieve all the built-up stress of the day so that I can go home and not vent it out on my husband.
Great coffee,"Great tasting coffee with a real nice aroma.  We love the K-cup way of brewing coffee, always fresh and lots of good choices."
Awesome,This item is great!!!!  I highly recommend it for all pit bull owners! it is the only chew toy that my 5 year old pit bull has not ripped apart.  It keeps her busy for hours!  She loves it!
Melitta,"These pods have good volume and favor.  However, they only work in a Melitta brewer (and not in a Senseo), unless you can use a generic pod holder in your Senseo brewer (which I do)."
Great!,Produce exactly as described and in great shape. I recieved the item promptly and without any difficulties. I would absolutely recommend to others and order for myself again! Thanks!
Beemans Chewing Gum 20-5,"I bought this product as part of a birthday gift for my husband.  He loves this gum, but it can be hard to find.  The last place we saw it at charged $1.50 for ONE pack of gum (5 pieces)!  This is definitely a deal for lovers of this wintergreen-y gum."
super healthy,I have to say the pizza flavor is not my favorite. They have a strong oregano flavor that is off-putting for me. I love how good for you they are though and I know I already like the chocolate flavor so I'll stick with those or try another flavor.
Fee Brothers Falernum,One of the best Cocktail Mixers I have ever used!! Works in all drinks. Makes the best Tropicals in the world.Very hard to find in stores.
good soda,My daughter was in Peru on a mission trip this last summer and loved their Inca Kola.  So for Christmas I decided to order her some.  We all had some and liked it as well.  It has a bubblegum/cream soda flavor.  Different!  But the price and shipping terribly high.
Perhaps I am spoiled by loose-leaf tea...,"I received this Earl Grey in my starter variety pack that came with my new Keurig.  I drink a lot of tea, so was excited to taste how the brewer handled teas.  I was disappointed with this blend.  It was very bitter, which is surprising to me, since I usually only get bitter tea when I forget that I have been steeping leaves.  The water is not in contact with the leaves very long, so I don't understand how the tea got so bitter.  I will be sticking with brewing coffee in the Keurig, and just using the hot water when I feel like tea."
love the plant.............but,the plants were great but I did'nt water them in time and they died. my bad<br />I will order from them again.
Packaging terrible. Grounds in Coffee,Who wants to drink coffee grounds. ewww! These are faulty. Don't waste your money unless you need grounds for composting.
good chocolate fix,I really enjoy this added to coffee for a mocha flavor.  Dissolves better than other fat free hot chocolate mixes.
Wonderful service and product,This is a wonderful product that my dog really loves.  there is only one thing to make this product better - 30 chews in the box so we would have one for every day of the month.
Simply The Best Paprika We've Found,"This is just a terrific, pungent, spicy paprika with just the right amount of heat. The metal can keeps it fresh. We've tried many others including Penzey's but never found a better paprika for any price."
great dog food...,"UPDATE:  They just raised the price another 3.00.  When are merchants going to learn that keeping the prices down lead to happier customers.  I will no longer be ordering the product and will go back to buying at Trader Joe's.  2.00 a can is as much as I pay...looks like greed is playing in on this...<br /><br />My dog is really, really picky (perhaps even spoiled)...we switched him from a dry food to wet food diet a little over a year ago when he was diagnosed with a chondrosarcoma in his mouth...since surgery, he's been put on mainly a FULL protein diet with as little carbs as possible...I do give him a bit of Wilderness or other high protein dry food as a crunch, but he's on wet food.<br /><br />This food has a great breakdown...essentially, add up the moisture, protein, fat, etc...and what is left over is carbohydrate...your dog is not an herbivore...he's a carivore.<br /><br />Feed your dog as much protein as possible and he'll be healthier...cancers feed on carbs...trust me, after researching this endlessly, I figured out what a dog needs best...<br /><br />This food is chunky, not ground up mush....you dog will like it...enjoy!"
Yummy,I bought the Coconut M&Ms for my wife as a birthday gift because she likes coconut. She LOVED it!!!
Detox,This was some of the best tea I've ever purchased! I'm usually pretty loyal to green tea or peppermint but the detox was wonderful. It wasn't bitter and the flavor wasn't overpowering. I've already reccommend this to many of my college friends after long weekends.
Yumm!,"I have bought and tried  lots of different chai tea brands: Tazo, Oregan chai, local shops etc. Tried this at a local shop and asked them the name of their chai as it was creamy and not overtly sweet and not too 'chai-ish' ( I know that isn't a word! ) When I looked it up on the Big Train website and was disappointed as I found they did not sell to the general public. I was glad to find it at Amazon and at a good price."
Delicious Maple Candy,We purchased this as a gift for a dear friend who has a particular fondness for Maple Sugar Candy. She was thrilled and apparently the candy was so good it didn't last long after we gifted it to her. I'd say that is a pretty good indication that the candy is a winner. Nicely packaged as well.
It is the purple ones that are the problem...,"and to a lesser extent the white ones.  The orange, red, green, and yellow are some of the best wine gum flavors I have eaten.  But the purple ones are supposed to be that strong almost border-line ""tastes so bad its good can I have another"" black currant flavor.  The Gutaf's ones are simply sweet with no discernable flavor.  So sad because one feels that a company that could do such an outstanding job with the other flavors, could do so much better. One caveat:  the white ones are, also, without discernable flavor, however, no respectable wine gum eater really expects too much of them, anyway.  Yes, it is the purple ones that will break your heart.<br /><br />And should you, actually, like the purple and white ones, I have three bags of rejects I could fish out of the trash for you."
Awesome cookies,"Awesome soft wonderful tasting cookies, half frosted vanilla, half frosted chocolate. The more cookies you buy, the more you save on postage as it's based on weight/total shipments. Vendor is also terrific to deal with. 5 stars"
Excellent Figs,"These are the best dried figs I have ever tasted. I also bought the black mission figs for comparison. These figs are larger and tastier than the black variety, yet have a chewier exterior. I personally find these to be worth the extra expense over the other variety, yet find both to be excellent organic dried fruits. Perfect, as nature intended."
Cute - but numbers wrong,"The rings were cute and quality as expected. However, the description lists 12 per pack, but we only received 8."
Price and quality,Price per lb + quality of ingredients have me and my 155lb Newfoundland loving this stuff. In today's economy it's nice to not skimp on the dog while still keep things affordable.<br /><br />What this stuff reeaaallllyyy needs is a subscribe and save option!
YUMMY,We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different. Not too many decafs to choose from. We were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor. I like my coffee on the milder side so I can even get 2 cups from 1 Kcup.
Love these energy chews!,These energy chews are absolutely delicious! They hold up really well in your pocket or backpack when you're backpacking or mountain biking! I really couldn't imagine eating any other energy chew ever again!
Cat Loves it!,"We got a new kitten in June and have been trying out different foods for him since.<br />As for the canned foods, Newman's Own Turkey has been his absolute favorite.<br /><br />A nice thing about this food is when you open the can, there is no overpowering smell to it.<br />Also, scooping the litter box is no big deal. Not an overpowering 'cat poo' smell to stink up the entire house!<br /><br />His coat is super shiny and soft, lots of energy, we're happy all around!"
A wonderful way to get my oats for oatmeal breakfast,I need to eat gluten-free and the oats I buy through Amazon make the process easy and quick. I will be doing more ordering this way.
"Yummy, yum, YUM!","Excellent tasting beverage is simply a combo of carbonated water and 100% fruit juice... and it sure is tasty! Out of the two flavors tried (black cherry flavor being the other), both tasted great, although the watermelon strawberry flavor was particularly appealing. Only problem: pricey compared to soda... but, hey, you get what you pay for. All in all, highly recommended."
A Delicious & Healthy Soup for On the Go!,"This soup is good and easy to make.  However, the most important characteristic is that it is nothing but healthy.  None of those pesky additives that are a constant part of convenience foods.  Enjoy!"
Our Doxies Love these,"It's true, our miniature dachshunds absolutely love these.  They are a special treat for them.  Unfortunately, they go through them fairly quickly, but it's their absolute favorite!"
Fast and Tasty Good Food,"I bought this because I like sweet and sour chicken. I was not disappointed. Instead of chicken, I use fresh<br />turkey breast meat. I also add curry to my rice while it is cooking. I used about 1/2 of the sweet and sour<br />mixture they supply, as I don't like it too sweet. Easy cleanup, as it is all gone!"
"Cheesy, low-carb goodness","I love salty snack foods, especially cheesy ones, and one of the things that I miss most on a low-carb regime are Doritos. The Sahale Southwest Cashews have all the spicy-cheesy-salty goodness of a Dorito, but are low carb -- 10g carb per quarter-cup. They're addictive. They're quite expensive (one cup of nuts per package), but if you're not worried about what you're paying for your snack food, these are great."
stale and little bacon,"This was my first purchase of this brand of dog cookies. I cook everything my dogs eat so I am always looking for things to keep in the pantry that are human grade ingredients and made in the USA to help me out when I am short on time. My Papillon is severely  allergic to flaxseed, soy, oats, brewers yeast and chicken which rules out most commercial foods and cookies. I was very disappointed in how stale these were and skimpy with the bacon bits. Call me crazy but I did a taste test like I do on my homemade dog cookies made with human grade ingredients. The expiration date was still a year away but without preservatives these have a much shorter shelf life than that. I store homemade dog cookies in the fridge or freezer to preserve quality but was hoping the claim of ""made fresh daily"" on the cute bag was true. My dogs and I give these ""Four Paws Down""."
-A variation of tootsie roll minis.,"I used to find these in local supermarkets, but now I have to search for them on the web.  Some of my friends like these, and I usually try to buy some for Halloween.  Favorite products seem to come and go."
Not worth it,"I have tried several coffee k-cups. From Starbucks to Moonlight coffee...virtually every kcup<br />This coffee tastes more like chemicals. No wonder the price is so low.<br /><br />Do not buy this Coffee -- sorry to say !!!  The worst coffee i ever bought and the biggest mistake i did that I bought several ones.... If anyone needs the chemical coffee , i am willing to sell it out for 50% less price"
Sugar free?,"Don't expect this to taste the same as what comes in the small 9 oz tins you buy at the local market. Different taste as well as texture. The shipment I recieved may have been sugar free. I've tried different sugar free flavors in the past, and the texture is different. This tasted just like vanilla sugar free which I don't care for. Amazon was gracious enough to refund. I had to throw it out."
WOW !!!,"I Don`t usually write reviews, but these noodles(sauce,flavor pack,oil,soy sauce,peppers) are really something special. If you are a fan of noodles you should really try these."
Can't find these any where,Thank God for Amazon. My husband is addicted to these fruit cup chillers and for the past 4 weeks I have not been able to find them in any of my local food stores. I started to think maybe DelMonte had discontinued the product. But thanks to Amazon I was able to order them by the case so my hubbies addiction is back on track!
DELICOUS TREAT FOR DOGS,"This is a Delicious treat for your dogs.  I am unhappy with<br />Amazon because we paid for the product, but never received it.<br /><br />Nanci Shea"
Happy with my Turmeric,"I actually bought this for two reasons--some to use in cooking but to grow as well.  It's too early to say if it will grow, but several of the roots looked viable for planting and it was fresh.  Good stuff, very anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant."
Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms,"I purchased these mushrooms as a gift and cooked them according to the directions for the Superbowl party.  Although the flavor was good, the mushrooms were soggy and the sauce that comes with them was very fatty.  I will not purchase these again."
"Finally, decent ramen","I don't know why people are saying this is bland. It has such peppery flavor I thought my wife added pepper to it. I also love that unlike Nissin or Maruchan, it's not laden with saltiness. The noodles were perfect: springy and flavorful. Their bounce was perfect in the broth so they didn't turn to mush. By far the best instant ramen I've ever had."
Excellent Germination Rate!,"This order arrived in good time and was securely packaged. I soaked about 6 cups of the seed overnight in a gallon of water, with appx. 1/2 tablespoon of baking powder, and they started to sprout in the water. This is my first experience growing wheatgrass, so I was definitely impressed. I got a few flats, filled them with organic soil, watered the soil through and sprinkled the seeds evenly across the top. I covered the seeds with damp paper towels and set the flats out on the porch away from direct sunlight. They are growing so fast! They germinated so well that now I'm wondering if I put too much seed on the flats. I have no complaints about this product."
Chow Hound Time!!,"Wow does my dog Pie LOVE these treats!! I was so happy to find them on Amazon. I love the fact that these treats are all natural. I'm careful about what I give Pie, especially after the last recall.<br /><br />And putting artificial food coloring in dog food has to be one of the most idiotic things that a company can do. All natural is the way to go!!"
Fresh,"This ginger exceeded my expectations, it is fresh and delectable and there is enough to last even this ginger-addict a long, long time."
Even Morris would go for this!!,This is an amazing cat treat -- and all natural.  It works on the pickiest eaters.  You can also moisten it with water to tempt a sick kitty.
Love this tea,"I enjoy Earl Grey Tea. Recently had a cup of Tazo Earl Grey tea at a local Starbucks. Liked it so much that I decided to purchase a number of boxes. They didn't have any in stock, so I checked Amazon and found a great deal on 6 boxes. Amazon actually had a better deal than the Starbucks website. Another great product and price from Amazon."
Stephens Hot Hazelnut Hot Chocolate,"This is simply the best hot chocolate mix I have ever used.  The flavor is wonderful, whether you like hazelnut or not (the hazelnut flavor is subtle.) It tastes like you made it from scratch rather than a mix.  It's difficult to find, so locating it on Amazon was a great find."
Kitty loves this stuff,"My cat cannot get enough of this product.  She sits at the pantry and meows at the container!  The can in larger and full, but the product is flaky so it doesnt last long.  Better buy a couple of them."
RUIN YOUR LIFE,"I innocently started giving these to my cats - had no idea they would begin to control my life.  Run out of treats?  you're screwed.  One cat cries so loud in the morning it sounds like someone is torturing her.  Eventually, the other cat jumps up on my face to wake me up...for treats.  It's like I'm living in a nightmare if I don't give them their fix.  C'mon...we know big corporations put addictive substances in candy, sodas & chips - - - of course they're in our cat treats.  And, seriously....they've hit the kitty crack jackpot w/ these.  Do yourself & your cat a favor:  Save your mental & your cat's physical HEALTH."
Great for soups and stews but need larger size,"I buy this Imagine brand or Kroger's Naturally Preferred brand organic free range chicken broth which is exactly the same thing (depending on which is on sale) at my local Kroger store in quart size containers - 32 oz.  I wish Amazon stocked it in 32 oz. containers at a competitive price.  A 16 oz. container would never do for us.<br /><br />It is absolutely wonderful for soups of any kind, from chicken noodle with veggies added to vegetable soup to bean soup or whatever.  Since we do not eat beef or pork I use this broth as the base of everything that needs broth.  I also use small quantities of it to 'quick saute' veggies, per the recommendation on whfoods.org and it works as well as oils which break down when heated.<br /><br />Heated in a pan by itself it is not so good.  However, since we don't eat ""plain"" anything, in my opinion this is THE best broth with no potato starch, bad oils or MSG."
Yummy!,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing something like this on line but I'm really glad I did.  I actually bought all 4 flavors but the Parmesan Blend is my favorite.  The tin is a little difficult to open but I was pleasantly surprised by how much dipping spice was in there!  The tins were packaged well for shipping and it all arrived as promised (it took about a week).  Also, there was a previous review questioning the expiration date...all of mine had a sticker with the date stamped on the bottom of the can."
good reusable bags at a lower price.,I purchased these for my mom so that she can have some reusable bags that will fold up into your purse.  They are not as nice as my enviro sacs but they do the job for a less money.  Much nicer than the ones you buy at the grocery store because they fit into your purse.
Yummy,"These things are great, it would be nice if they had a bit more cheese in them, but they are still really good as it is. Getting them from Amazon ends up being a little cheaper than from my local stores."
Dog likes them....,"I have a Rottweiler puppy and he really loves these. He loves to gnaw on them for a few minutes before actually eating them. The medium size is just about right for his since he just a puppy. They biscuits are mostly protein with a few percent of fat. I have purchased other biscuits and he just refuses to eat them. He will sniff them and just ignore them. He didn't even hesitate with these. I had these on the counter and his nose was right up there trying to figure out if that box was for him. These biscuits are loose in the box. They are not sealed in a bag and in the box. I threw these in a plastic container to seal the scent and to keep them fresh. Although, I don't think dogs really care about freshness. I will be purchasing these again."
YUM!!,These are beyond delicious!  They curb that sweet tooth craving and I love putting a couple in a mug of hot chocolate or a mocha latte.  These candies are a mild and enjoyable mint flavor - not overpowering in the least.  Even my daughter who greatly dislikes peppermint is hooked on these!
Maxwell House Hazelnut,"This coffee is the perfect blend of coffee and hazelnut flavor! I haven't found a coffee yet that can top this one!It disappeared from store shelves in IL several years ago. I was thrilled to see it was available at Amazon. If you like hazelnut, you will LOVE this!"
British seal of approval,"I'm English and very fussy about my tea. Not too keen on Tetley (though they do make a decent decaf that my wife drinks in the evening). <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AXZ7Q8"">Tetley British Blend Naturally Decaffeinated Premium Black Tea, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>. I used to drink PG Tips but nowadays I find it to be too strong, particularly if you're making a cup at a time (versus making a pot). I've been drinking the Newman's Own Organics for about a year now and my wife and I both love it. It's consistently good, box to box. I use one tea bag per cup, brewed for exactly 4 minutes. I always add milk, but that's just how Brits drink their tea. I use this as my tea timer. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R4BP34"">Polder TMR-540 Opus Digital Triple Timer with Clock, Stainless Steel and Black</a>. It has a pleasant bird chirp for the alarm instead of an annoying beep. It has three timers. I preset one for 4 minutes, and just need to hit a single button when I brew the tea."
"Delicious, Nutritious","Very tasty and a nice balance of protein, calories, and sugar.<br /><br />Most of the Clif brands now have way too much sugar for my taste or diet. Earnest hits it right on the spot."
just a warning alert,"XYLITOL and products sweetned with  xylitol<br /><br />I read on the internet  a warning for pet owners.  This product is not safe<br />for dogs  and I would probably include pets in general.<br />I think people need to be aware that dogs eat most anything  they smell,<br />so even the gum or sweets  made with this sweetner would be dangerous."
Excellent Chips.,"These are excellent chips.  I have enjoyed them in larger bags and was happy to find these affordable smaller bags, as they are so good that I can easily eat the whole bag if I buy a big bag! They arrived fast and very fresh.  I also love that they are gluten free, so I was able to recommend them to my nephew."
Lovely stuff,"A UK recipe that I was making called for Bird's Custard powder and I was lucky to find it here on amazon.  I've since used it twice: for Nanaimo bars (marvelous) and a homemade banana custard.  In both instances, the result was excellent.  I've always made homemade puddings for my kids and this definitely gives a lighter, smoother consistency than plain old cornstarch.  Highly recommended."
The office favorite,"When I started working at my current employer, we had a Keurig and many, many coffee choices, mostly because each person had their own favorites. I was trying all the coffees looking for my favorite when I found a sample pack of Vermont Country Blend. A few cups of coffee later, it had become my favorite, and I ordered a box. Soon, everyone in the office was drinking it, and it's the only coffee we stock now. I always feel pleased when we have guests at the office, and they compliment the coffee - which is most of the time we have guests. It makes me feel like I found a real gem."
Best chips ever,"The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!"
pretty good,"I read directions wrong and first batch so sweet.  When I put powder in bottle, there's smoke rising from the powder, not a good thing I thought.  It tastes great, but if it sits in bottle too long, the stuff will turn into gel, so that also tells me something.  Think I'll stick to Heed products."
Wonderful anise flavor...,"I tried these five years ago at a Greek cafe. They're sweet, with the pungent flavor of anise. I've looked for them over the years without success until a few days ago. I ordered them and they arrived a day before the estimated arrival. I couldn't be happier, the price is wonderful too."
LOVE IT,"The Marley coffee is the best aroma and taste. It provides a true coffee experience that lets you know this is special. Myself and family work long hours, so this is our reward every morning and evening. I provide my co-workers and clients the same Marley coffee with its 5 star experience."
Wish I'd found these sooner!,"I'd always heard of Pill Pockets and thought they were just stupid. Why pay a lot for treats with a hole in them when you can just wrap some cheese around the pill? Until my dog got so sick she refused to eat anything at all. The vet gave me some of these to try, and she would eat them and the pills inside right away, when she refused to eat anything else.<br /><br />I've also discovered they make great training treats, because you can break off small pieces without dropping crumbs everywhere. I've always had problems with treats that leave crumbs because my dogs spend more time hunting for crumbs than listening to me. Wish I'd started using these years ago!"
Anasazi Beans,"These are the best beans you can eat.  They look like a red pinto, but the flavor is unreal.  They cook up within a couple of hours, so it's not an all day ordeal. I highly recommend them."
Status Symbol?,"If you want to spend $40-$50 for a pound of coffee, so you can tell your friends you did, go ahead.  But, while very good, this coffee is no better than other ""premium"" coffees at $12 per pound."
GREAT SPACE SAVER,"Your Keurig coffee maker fits perfectly on this drawer.  It's really nice to have your Kcups right their and saves space.  There's not much more I can say about a storage drawer, but that I dig it!"
Tug - a - Jug Excellent Product,"The Tug - a - Jug is another excellent product for a puppy that destroys most toys.  While the rope was eventually destroyed, I put some little balls in the jug & my puppy still loves this product."
Excellent toy,"Great toy, will last for months.  Rawhide rings only last a minute or two but the bone and ball are great."
Hot Pork Rinds,Many years ago I purchased Lawry's microwave pork rinds at Walmart and Publix.  And then they were gone - from both stores.  And then I got the brilliant idea to try Amazon.com!  I've actually ordered 7 cases for myself and my sons.  We're thrilled.  You'll never want any other pork rinds after you've tasted these!
excellent product,"Damn good product. My cats are very pickie and will only eat certain foods which changes frequently. But not with this product. They love it. I only wish when I order from Amazon I could get all my products from one source. I get the greenies from one source then I also order pill pockets made by the same manufacturer which I get from several other sources. I end up getting a number of deliveries on different days. But, it's cheaper than stores like Petsmart and Petco., whc"
Great for our boxer with Colitis,Our boxer has had colitis since she was a puppy.  We struggled to find a food that would not cause it to flare up.  We've been using this for a few years now without any problems.
Don't like brown rice? Try this one,"Brown rice can be, well, heavy. But Texmati has all the fragrance of basmati rice, the fiber of brown rice and it comes in a wonderful clear square plastic jar that is great for filling with beans or popcorn when it is empty. This rice smells like pecans when cooking and tastes great. You can cook it up as pilaf with raisins, almonds and chicken or vegetable broth for a delicious side dish. Try it also by browning it in olive oil with a half cup of orzo per cup of rice and then make pilaf with broth. It is delicious."
Center of cookie is rock hard,The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.
"Makes using garlic a pleasure, no work and plenty of flavor.","We love garlic bread with our pasta. First, we always<br />make garlic butter - with garlic juice all you need<br />to do is mix some juice into the butter and get a creamy<br />garlic butter which spreads on toasted french bread<br />and there you have it. Delicious. Fast."
The best you'll ever had,I highly recommend this Jerky Spice works to anyone that has a hydrater and wants to make beef jerky.
Yuck,"I was so excited for this product and unfortunately, it's terrible. I tastes nothing like Italian dressing or even any kind of dressing."
great deal fast shipping,"Will be back.  These are great for the Dogs teeth, and our vet recommended them."
Healthy family,"I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great."
Yummy!,"These are a nice, light alternative to ordinary potato chips. To me, they have a sort of buttery flavor. They're crunchy, a little sweet, and not the least bit greasy. My husband took some to work and they were a huge hit with his coworkers. In fact, he had none left for himself!"
That Last Drop is Still Good,"Coffee consumption is about one of these cans in 8 days.  Our consumption is just plain coffee and no frills.  With Maxwell House we get decent tasting full bodied coffee at a reasonable price per container.  This Dark Roast is considerably better  to us than the standard original coffee from Maxwell House. Admittedly we usually switch between this brand and another depending on price per ounce; however, now this is our brand of choice.  One of these days we might splurge and try one of the gourmet types but the odds are close to zero as long as those brands are far too expensive for our tastes.  The container keeps the product fresh and ready to use.  It does not particularly enjoy the land fill and at about four of these per month there is little demand for more empty containers.  I must admit I use the grey tops to assist me in building my anti-ant device to protect hummingbird feeders and it works quite well.  Who cares when the coffee is this great."
Great price for daily dog treats,"My dogs look forward to their daily treat of Greenies.  Daily reward plus breath freshener for dogs.  Great price for the value size container, fast shipping."
Drinks were chalky at bottom,These drinks have a chalky residue in bottom of carton as if was spoiled. The drinks received before this shipment was okay.  I think I read something that said that amazon is aware of this problem but yet they shipped me this batch anyway.
Untouched by disappointed cats,"Everyone gave these treats rave reviews, so I thought I would give them a try. I have two cats, one who is very picky and one who will eat just about anything I give her, even other breath fresheners that the other cat doesn't care for. I assumed that at least one would take the bait. Both cats completely snubbed these things. Sniffed at and walked away cold. I broke one in half in case the inside might reveal more aroma. Nothing. I know all cats have different tastes, but it's a little weird that I got no reaction at all, not even a reconnaissance lick. Oh well."
A full-bodied decaf,"I love English breakfast tea and drink it every morning, but in the evening I need to drink decaf tea. I have tried several brands of decaf English breakfast tea<br />and found them all to be pale shadows of their fully caffeinated versions, until I tried this one. No pale reflections here, this is the real deal!<br />This is a full-bodied English breakfast tea which is a pleasure to drink."
"Balance of Sweet, Tart and a Hint of Spice","Alpine Spiced Cider is a great instant cider blend. Many quick, powdered drinks are one-note, but this one isn't. It manages to be both sweet and tart like real apple cider, and has just a hint of cinnamon and mulled spice in the background. During long, cold winters, it's so nice to have a fast treat like this cider to help warm you up inside.<br /><br />Because these have a good amount of Vitamin C, they are also excellent for the inevitable winter colds. On those horrible days when even opening and heating a can of chicken soup seems too hard, all you have to do is switch your electric kettle to on, dump the packet into a cup and you're good to go. Maybe a cup of apple cider a day can even keep the doctor away, who knows?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the Alpine Spiced Cider Drink Mixes as a quick and easy way to enjoy a hot beverage. It won't be as authentic as homemade cider, but it won't be a hassle to prepare either."
It's OK to drink the water in the can,"It's OK to drink the water in these Del Monte French Style Green Beans cans because no salt has been added and lead has been banned from the canning process in the U.S.  In fact, according to the ""Nutrition Facts and Analysis"" website, the fluid in the can contains at least 20% of the nutritional value (vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants) of the entire can of green beans.  So drink the fluid inside the can as if it were a very healthy tea.  All beans are moderately high in antioxidants (and calories).  French Style Green Beans are slightly above average among beans in antioxidants and substantially below average among beans in calories.  Among beans, only soybeans, which are high in calories, are healthier for us to eat than these low-calorie green beans.  Eating 6 cans of green beans equals the same number of calories as eating 1 can of soybeans.  Like most modern varieties of green beans, there is no string in these French Style Green Beans.  When compared against Libby's French Style Green Beans (no salt added), Del Monte (this product) was just slightly firmer and just slightly better tasting inside the can.  But Libby's product is priced slightly lower than Del Monte's.  According to whfoods.com, green beans are moderately high in the carotenoids, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin and in the polyphenols/bioflavonoids miquelianin, quercetin, kaempferol, catechins, epicatechins, and procyanidins and in the absorbable, bone-friendly mineral, silicon."
"The MOST disgusting, delicious, stuff I ever heard of.","Actually, it only SOUNDS disgustingly sweet.<br />It sorta tastes like one of those glass bottled<br />""fake cocoa"" drinks you see at the deli... or<br />in one of the mobile ""roach trucks"" that drive<br />up to the loading dock of where YOU work...<br />well...<br />it's carbonated...<br />it IS in a can...<br />it ISN'T so sweet...<br />and it IS a clever idea<br />for diabetics that just cannot<br />pry their remaining fingers off of.<br /><br />I'd like to see a REESES' PEANUT BUTTER CUP cereal...<br />oh yeah... I forgot<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5D42"">Reese's Peanut Butter Puffs Cereal, 13-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>"
YUM YUM,"God I love this candy!  Made several purchases of it and consumed them all over time.  Wish it had more nuts in it as I remember them from the old days, but good enough to keep purchasing them."
The best,"This is the best dog food we've ever used, and we've used some that are more expensive.  We also had them on a raw food diet for about a year and were giving probiotics at that time.  They love this and they don't fart anymore!  I still give them the occasional raw egg for a treat.  They're in great health.  Also, better digestion means less dog turds to clean up in the yard."
Tasty mix of sweet and savory,"These bars are a great if you like snacks that are a little bit sweet and  a little bit savory.  I love that the nuts are whole and huge so you really get a sense of what you are eating.  I can be picky about nutrition and snack bars because sometimes they are overly sweet or leave you feeling hungry an hour or so later.  Thankfully for me, these do neither.  I also appreciate the nutritional information on these.  At 190 calories (and 11 grams of fat) they are perfect for a snack or pairing with a salad or half sandwich to make a filling lunch.  The only thing I wish is that these were a little less sugary.  I'd rather that a sweetener wasn't the second ingredient on the list (especially wen there is another sweetener listed on the ingredients and some of the dried fruits seem to be sweetened with apple juice, but otherwise this bar is pretty fantastic and satisfying."
The absolutely best pancake mix ever!,"After discovering Elizabeth Barbone's great gluten free cookbooks I've been making a lot of my own mixes, but I won't give up my pancakes from Pamela's Pancake mix. It is truly excellent! And the chocolate chip (I add walnuts too) cookie dough made from this mix never makes it to the oven! Too tasty!"
Bellagio - Wholesale style! Yum,"Every culture has differences on their choco concoction. Even Milo/ Ovaltine is made differently. Asians tend to favor sweeter chocolate drinks, while Latino countries like that strong  cocoa flavor.<br /><br />I like European style and Bellagio is great because it has that smooth creamy taste. Reminds me of Belgian chocolate which is different from Hershey's.<br /><br />No water needed. Just heat some water and mix! love it on the go too!!!!"
Healthier Constant Comment,"If you like the original, you'll like this fruity flavorful tea in the green version. And if green is truly healthier, well then it just gets better."
EXOTIC TEA,"TRIED THIS TEA ONCE AND BECAME ""HOOKED"" ON EXOTIC SPICY FLAVOR!  MAKES A DELICIOUS ICED TEA AND IF YOU HAVE IT ON AUTO MONTHLY DELIVERY YOU GE A NICE BREAK ON S & H PRICE  !"
Natural goodness!,"I love that these are not only a very tasty treat for my dog, but also good for him, which I am all about!"
100% Chicken,"Just what I had been looking for in a reward for my cocker, no fat & she just loves them, they are just dehydrated chicken breast, about the size of a quarter, crisp & we snapped them in half to use as rewards. Great stuff, with no stomach upset like you see after feeding some of those doggie cookies, biscuits, or processed items."
watermelon lollipops,Great lollipops...taste exactlyl like watermelon!  Used them for centerpieces for my sons BarMitzvah and the kids loved them!  Would definitely buy them again!
Yummy,These are great. They are so tasty & with 10 grams of protein per 1 oz bag they are a super easy way for us non-chef's to get protein. I will say that they aren't as filling as the pretzel sticks but they do taste darn good!!!
Awful,"These things are awful. I was thinking I would be getting a soft, moist chocolate cake with creamy filling - similar to a hostess cupcake but with the ""oreo taste"" - these things are awful. The cake is stale in its consistency - this is not an old or opened package - bought em soon as they hit stores. The icing is about the same as the cookie - not creamy. The cake part is really just plain awful!! Stick to hostess cakes or plain oreos."
Carbonated watermelon juice in a can,"I found this drink interesting in terms of taste; it is watermelon juice infused with carbonation, and a burst of strawberry. Carbonation makes the juice acidic and produces stronger effect on taste buds than the fruit juice.  It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink is very interesting and it is recommended.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00113IS5E"">airforce Nutrisoda Renew, Watermelon and Blueberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br />2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012FLJDO"">FlavH2O Kiwi Watermelon Drink (Pack of 12)</a><br />3.

good coffee,"I was really impressed with this coffee, it has a nice bold taste, yet a smooth<br /> finish. I would order this coffee again."
Love them,This are large great tasting lightly salted. I really enjoy them and they arent over powering.
Great cup of coffee,I just purchased the Cuisinart cup o matic and just love it. I have been trying all different types of pods even though I can use regular ground coffee and the Senseo dark roast is our favorite. The deal with 6 bags of 18 for 27dollars is a better deal than most especially with no cost for shipping. I give this a 5 somehow it only shows 1 but AAAAA+
"Maybe too good, cats don't want anything else!","We occasionally feed a couple stray cats as they are good at keeping the mice and snakes away. Once in awhile we will give them some of these Temptations Cat Treats and they are crazy about them! They will only eat the regular cat food if their efforts at getting more of the Temptations Treats doesn't work. One of them will sit at the door and meow and meow but eventually goes and eats the regular food. We have tried all the different varieties of Temptations Treats and they don't have a preference, they like all of them. If you want something to really great to give your cat, try any variety of the Temptations Cat Treats but be prepared for your cat to start begging for these all the time. The one thing we cannot tell is how good nutritionally these are for cats, the package says 100% nutritionally complete but not sure what that means in this case. Even if you could feed a cat these alone, that would be way too expensive so for now I will balance a few treats with regular varieties of dry cat food."
The beef Jerky,"Most pieces were perfect, but about 1/4 of the bag had really chewy (fatty) meat."
Sugar-Free Brownies - Diabetes related issue,"Extremely satisfied... got precisely what I ordered and wanted.  I appreciate that we are permitted to modify the order while still keeping it in force.  Next time the option appears, I will either spread it out to more than three months or reduce the number.  Six boxes in three months maybe a bit more than I need as I am told to cut back/eliminate.  But these are a great way to get my chocolate fix.  Only the CHOC FUDGE is carried by our stores, but the MILK CHOC is what I prefer.<br /><br />On a similar note, why do stores limit their sugar free inventory?  Because they do is why I had to come online to purchase this product.  I had made requests at our local stores to carry this product, but it was not accommodated."
So convenient!!,"If you've ever made popcorn in a machine you know what a pain it can be to get the right seasoning, the right oil taste and order decent popcorn that pops the way it should.  Once we started ordering the Great Northern Popcorn packets we didn't have to worry about it anymore.  It is so easy to make popcorn now because we don't have to measure anything or worry about the mess.  One easy step and we have perfect popcorn.  The kids can even do it!  I would definitely recommend giving this a try."
I should say my wife liked it,"Not a bad deal when you consider what we were paying in the stores.  The snack pack works well for my mother-in-law because it limits the amount she can eat at any one time and she needs to watch her diet.  I figure she should be able to enjoy snacks at her age, but common sense and mom-in-law are not compatible when it comes to cookies."
i am so pleased,I recieved the grains within a couple of days of placing my order. They arrived in great condition. I followed the directions included in the package and was amazed at how quickly they multiplied. It has been a little over 2 weeks and I have more grains than I need (that's a good thing). The product was everything I'd hoped for. Thank you.
Good stuff,"First off, the ingredients listed on here are not the same as the ingredients listed on the bags I received. The bags state as follows, Organic beef, sea salt, organic sucanat (cane sugar), organic spices, celery juice powder, cane sugar, organic garlic powder.<br /><br />No, the jerky is not spicy at all, but it is pretty tasty. The bags are pretty small and so are the pieces of jerky, but at about 4 bucks a pop they're a pretty good deal for organic jerky."
Bitter and weak,"I bought two six packs when this was on special recently and since the reviews were few and all over the place, the price was low enough that I took a gamble.<br /><br />If you buy this, keep in mind that you need two tablespoons of beans per cup.  This is twice the amount of coffee usually called for and these are the instructions on the Community Coffee bag.  The good thing is that you'll go through this coffee twice as quickly, so as long as you brew regularly...you'll use it up relatively quickly.<br /><br />The taste is on the bitter side, so I have been compensating with cream and more stevia than I usually use with my coffee.  I have been using Zero Water to brew my coffee and even that doesn't help this coffee to taste great.<br /><br />It's not great, it's not terrible.  My son will drink it with me, my wife will not.  It certainly isn't dishwater as the one and two star reviews for this product indicate, it IS better than that.  I was disappointed that this didn't live up to the four and five star reviews.  This certainly does not hold up to the taste and quality of beans that I have gotten from Dunkin' Donuts although since DD runs about $6 per pound and this ran about that for 2 1/4 pounds, it seems like a good deal.  Again, since you use twice the amount of this brand vs. DD, the per cup price ends up about the same just absent the quality<br /><br />I am almost done my first bag and it has lasted about two weeks.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this coffee, but alas I just can't get there.  If I have a better experience with the remaining bags, I will post an update to this review."
Worth the price,"Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track."
A crunch of heaven,My friend at work brought these to work one day- actually the texarkana ones. I tried some and started to look for them in grocery stores. They're delicious on their own and much yummier with hummus. You won't regret it.
Not bad,"I tried two flavors of Switch; the Orange Tangerine and the Watermelon Strawberry. I liked the watermelon flavor a lot, but found that with Orange Tangerine, the flavor of the can came through a bit too much. It reminded me of why I've never really enjoyed drinking canned orange juice. Still, it was fairly good and the carbonation made it light and refreshing. Both flavors were a big, big hit with my 8 year-old son."
Too expensive,"I'm sorry but for the price I was expecting more.  I was unimpressed.  The taste is good but in my opinion, seems no better than regular hot chocolate.  Most likely will not purchase this again."
LOVE THIS COFFEE!!!,"I love this coffee and will stick with it.  I've been drinking it for quite some time.  It has a very nice flavor with a hint of chocoloate/cocoa (now when I drink ""regular"" coffee, I can really tell the difference.  The cocoa makes it so delicious!)<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee - the coffee is not strong or bitter. I would consider it medium strength (also, depends how much you use per pot of coffee)."
Great Iced Tea,"My husband and I both enjoy this iced tea made with our Keurig.  It has a mildly sweet taste, not overly sweet like many teas.  I don't care for iced tea that tastes like Kool-Aid, so this is perfect in my opinion!  Just fill a glass with ice and place it under the Keurig drip.  So easy to get a freshly brewed sweet tea!"
Not as good as the original..,"I really enjoyed the original,but this does not taste as well to me. I am not sure what the problem is but it taste like it needs something. I will never order this one again. I gave it 3 stars because the rum taste is very good. Otherwise I would have given it 1 star."
Indulge Your Tastebuds,"About a month ago, I noticed a new product at my local QFC. It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks.  I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies.  Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale ""town mouse"" to my regular, boring ""country mouse"" trail mixes.<br /><br />The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn't even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!<br /><br />The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.<br /><br />These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love."
kale,everyone keep telling me how good kale chips are boy was they wrong it is very nasty and i did not care for the kale chips and i will never get these again
Love this and wasn't sure I would!,"I loved the taste of this and I am not a drinker. I wasn't sure how it would be and I have found it to be light and refreshing, I am a huge fan. My ONLY complaint is I have had trouble finding it. I finally did at a local walgreen! But I would recommend it highly. Not too sweet or tart"
Great nutrion in a portable package,"My toddler daughter loves these packets. My only complaint is that the cap is a choking hazard, because it is so small. I love being able to offer her a snack that is made from real fruit and not overly sugared. We keep a few in her diaper bag with us at all times."
Very good!,"We make fresh bread in an automatic bread machine at least once weekly and these mixes are very good. I purchased several different mixes. Not every one is my favorite, but that is to be expected. The supplied yeast is fresh and active. The price on amazon was much lower then even the manufacturers own website store...so combined with the supersaver shipping it was a nice deal. Highly recommended."
Carrot Cake,"I just discovered a new flavor of Larabar:  Carrot Cake.  I love carrot cake, and this bar is awesome.  It tastes just like carrot cake.  The yummy, scrumptious ingredients of dates, almonds, walnuts, raisins, pineapple, unsweetened coconut, carrots, cinnamon, and extra virgin olive oil all put together is heavenly.  This is one of my favorite flavors of Larabars.<br /><br />I can't sing enough praises for Larabars:  good taste, healthy, convenient.  It's good to have a few (or a lot) on hand in case you get a little hungry or weak.<br /><br />And, oh, I must mention:  These bars are created and made in Colorado.  I know, that has nothing to do with the goodness of these bars.  But Colorado is my new favorite state, so I mentioned it.  The goodness of these bars are just as wonderful as Colorado is beautiful.  And if you know how breathtaking Colorado is, then you know I am comparing these bars to something awesome.  Awesome, healthy, tasty bars that are convenient.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like these type of bars.<br /><br />Carrot cake highly recommended if you like carrot cake."
Taste,Vanilla tastes like cake batter. It makes it hard to mix with other flavors. And its very sweet. So maybe chocolate would be a better choice next time
Juicy Juice with fizz!,"Switch black cherry cola tastes a whole lot like Juicy Juice with carbonation added.  Here's the deal - it's made with sparkling water and pure fruit juice from concentrate.  It tastes great!  But as a healthy alternative to soda?  Hmmm!  Well, it is all natural.  It also gives you 100% of your Vitamin C.  But it has the same calories as a Coke, and packs in 33 grams of sugar per can.  So it's got vitamins, but it also has some high calories and lots of sugar to boot.  Does it taste good though?  Heck yes! I would drink it as a treat, or in place of soda when that is appropriate.  Great taste!  It's also refreshing."
HOLY BEEEEJEEEZUZ!!! YEEEECH!,"I eat meat and vegetarian foods , and prepare a wide variety of both....but just let me start out by saying , this stuff is flat out creepy!!! the texture is very slimy and not like jerky at all , and has like thick stringy veins in it....nothing like real meat jerky at all...very rubbery and hard to stomach...iam a big fan of stonewalls jerquee and will stick with that!!!  i just dont get trying to be all disgusting with the drippy sinewy veins that they are trying to win you over with??? even real meat jerky has a more palatable consistency."
Best dog food there is!,"Blue Buffalo is amazing. I have a 90lb lab and 20lb mutt, both get Blue Buffalo and love it! We have tried other brands (Evo, Nutro, etc...) and Blue Buffalo is by far the best.  Our lab gets ear infections from any other type of food and our mutt is a picky eater. Both of them scarf this down with no problems! We also have switched our cat onto Blue Buffalo, and he loves it. HIGHLY recommended, worth the extra money and is it of good quality and you actually end up feeding you pet less of this food than others."
Doesn't taste good,This doesn't taste good at all! It actually made me sick. The salt content is astronomonical. It is so salty it's unbelievable.  Nice try for an instant gluten free product but it doesn't make the mark!
I am addicted!,"I love this stuff!  I am not a coffee drinker and don't like regular hot chocolate but love the mild taste of the French Vanilla plus it mixes up and stays mixed up, no sediment at the bottom from not stirring repeatedly.  Plus a little added bonus, I have found that drinking a cup of this every night actually helps me to sleep (now go figure?)"
Sweet!!,"We've been using Stevia Extract Powder for years and recommend it's use especially for people with diabetic conditions, or simply wanting to drop the calories from sugar use....The 1 pound price of $47 (NOW product), including shipping was fantastic... I would buy from them again and again. As usual, the product arrived professionally packed and intact.."

My favorite coffee!!,"Every morning when I wake up, I know I am going to have a perfect cup of coffee!!!  It's not too mild and not too strong, just right for me."
Great light taste and keeps ya running,This is the best sport drink I have ever used.<br />Most other products I have used in the past left my tummy aching after drinking them.<br />Nuun tablets not only taste great and didn't slow me down.
Dogs loved them!,My dogs loved them. I'm not sure if it's helped their hips at all.<br />But I'll keep giving them the chicken strips to find out.
Good Variety! What I wanted.,"The cost of this is excellent when you include it under super shipper savings. You can't beat the price of a variety of coffees. I did get a lot of one brand and a lot of one type over others, but expected that. It came in a brown paper bag, stapled shut. I didn't mind that at all, I just dump it all in my K-cup drawer anyway! I will purchase again. Here is what I got:<br /><br />8 - Green Mountain Gingerbread<br />5 - Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice<br />3 - Green Mountain French Vanilla<br />1 - Green Mountain Carmel Vanilla Cream<br />2 - Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />2 - Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 - Gloria Jean French Vanilla<br />3 - Gloria Jean Hazelnut<br />1 - Gloria Jean Butter Toffee<br />2 - Kahlua: Kahlua Original<br />1 - Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />Denise"
Kitty loves this!,Making kitty toys and my kitty who is very particular LOVES this catnip!<br />HIghly recommend and the quantity is super!
More please!!,"I found these wondering the isle of Target one day.  I'd decided to try baby food again because all of a sudden she stopped eating fruits and veggies.  Won't touch them if she recognizes them.  I don't know if a carrot or a pea chased her in one of her dreams, but it's been a nightmare trying to force her to eat them.  So for a time I just gave up and then she gained weight...oh no.  So went to find some baby apple sauce and stumbled upon these.  Best. Discovery. Ever.<br /><br />I take 2 with me when we're out, and give them to her when we're in the car or in between plays on the playground.  The best part of these is that I can 'inject' these into her when we're rushed. She's loved all of the flavors except for the Sweet Potatoes, and gets a kick out of eating them herself.<br /><br />After calculating what it would cost for me to make such concoctions (cheap but time consuming) and taking into consideration the method of delivery (the spouted pouch, which is about 50% of this product's wow factor) that I can not imitate, Amazon is the very best place to buy these yummy pouches.  Amazon's price makes my daughter consuming 2-3 of these a day affordable."
Quinoa Very Good and Good for You,Bob's Red Mill Quinoa is a great value from Amazon.<br />Quinoa is one of the best grains to eat. It has the highest content of several important nutrients and is a complete protein. It has a bit of a nutty flavor and is a great alternative to rice. It is also gluten free.
Pretty Good for what is is,"For what is is, this cookie is pretty good. Does it taste like the soft, under-baked, buttery kind you get from a bakery or your favorite shoppe? No, however it does satisfy a sweet tooth. In my opinion these taste just like a ""less sweet"" version of the chips ahoy brand I ate as a kid."
Great for a sore throat,"My mom gave me licorice tea whenever I had a bad throat, and it really was soothing to my throat.  This works just as well!<br /><br />Now, if you really really dislike the flavor of licorice, you might want to stay away from this tea.  I don't typically like licorice (I can tolerate it), but this isn't too bad.  Sometimes I drink it just for the scent and flavor."
tasty,"Tasty coffee.  Works well in drip coffee maker.  Smooth taste and nice flavor.  Remember it's preground, so don't expect fresh ground, recently roasted bean taste.  But it's a lot more convenient."
Delicious,Absolutely delicious.  I put the tea bags into my iced tea maker and drink it cold.  I can't say if it tastes good warm or not though.  It gives me a mild boost of energy that I need. I highly recommend it.
lots of the flavors i didnt really want or need,I thought this would be a good deal but i ended up with lots of cinnamon and spearmint and peppermint like 4 or 5 of each then a few of the good flavors
A pleasure to enjoy these very large snails from CONSUL!,"Packed 72-in, I expected the snails to be smaller. They were very large and the liquid drainage was minimal. I was happy and surprised at the value. I will order again from CONSUL!"
Great deal on quality chia seed!,"I'm so glad I found the folks selling this chia seed. It's such a good deal that I can't imagine buying it from anyone else and I sure hope they continue to make it available at this price. Don't believe the hype that chia seed varies much in nutritional content -- I've done the research and according to Dr. Wayne Coates from the University of Arizona all the commercially available chia seed today is from a single genetic source. Dr. Coates wrote a book reviving interest in the value of this traditional food source and in making it available to more people. I am not affiliated with the company that sells this chia seed, and the reason I did this research is that I was recently told about a ""miracle"" product made from a specific variety of chia seed, and it was outrageously expensive ($30.00/pound). It is only available through ""vendors"" and I was told it was the only chia seed that is nutritionally beneficial, not like the black chia seed used for chia pets. Well, it's not true, folks. Like anything that's grown, chia seed can be affected by growing practices, soil, etc. But it's a plant that demands very little and normally grows on very lean soils. It also is not bothered by pests, so no pesticides are needed for its cultivation. It is, however, sometimes grown in rotation with other crops like corn and maize for which pesticides are used. For this reason, organic chia seed has not yet been available. Some companies are promising that they will make organic chia seed available soon. But for now -- chia seed is chia seed, and this is perfectly good chia seed at the best price I've found."
Tasty alternative to Cane Sugar,"This Honey Granules is tasty and a welcome alternative to Cane Sugar. I use it in my morning oats (steel cut oats), Bird's custard and Tea. One or two teaspoonfuls go a long way. It is better stored in the refrigerator. Consider it in place of over-processed store bought cane sugar."
The Magical World Of Toast...,"It's amazing how many wonderful things can go on a simple piece of bread.  Peanut butter, hazlenut butter, almond butter...  Then don't forget the wonderful Marmite, a yeast extract.  Sigh...  But Marmite, Marmite is for eating toast while reading ""Moby [...]"", or perhaps ""Barnaby Rudge"". A bit hearty.  Nutella is for eating toast while reading ""Remebrance Of Things Past"" or ""Dracula"".  Rather luscious.  Like Marmite, Nutella goes a lot farther than the prescribed serving size.  Spread thinly.  Now, my children, go out and turn your whole wheat toast into a chocolate doughnut.  Marcel Proust would want you to."
Cherry Pie Larabars -- love them!  (and also other flavors),"I have been on a long quest for ""nutrition bars"" (or whatever you want to call them) that don't have refined sugar, aren't too sweet (however they're sweetened), don't have soy, and generally don't have extra crud in them. These are perfect!<br /><br />I like the flavor, and I like that the ingredients list is so short: ""dates, almonds, and cherries"". (200 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber. See larabar dot com for more.)<br /><br />They are a little bit gooier/processed than I was expecting... I had to check after a taste that there wasn't soy in there gluing everything together. But when I think about fruit leather that makes sense. In some ways, it's like a thick fruit leather with some larger bits of fruit and nuts.<br /><br />But I'm really glad to find them and will be trying more flavors. This is just the sort of bar I was hoping for.<br /><br />Update: My next favorite flavor so far is Chocolate Coconut Chew, which should not be mistaken for a candy bar-type snack, as I feared it might. It's not that sweet and not that chocolately. It's more substantial. Ingredients: ""Dates, almonds, walnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut"". 240 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber... and I'm sorry I don't have the energy right now to type the rest. (Ah! But you can get it online if you put a dot com after larabar!)<br /><br />I also like Ginger Snap enough to have bought a box. They are, yes, a little cookie-ish (though with the same gooey consistency as the rest). I do love ginger, but I don't find myself reaching for this flavor and probably won't reorder. Ingredients: ""Dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon, cloves"". 240 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber.<br /><br />Other flavors I have tried (Note that I prefer less sweet things, although all of them have a dose of sweet)<br />  * Tropical Fruit Tart: I won't get this again; for me this was like a pina colada and not what I want in a food bar (partly, this means it was too sweet for me, but also all the desert-y flavors in that bar)<br />  * Peanut Butter and Jelly: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Cashew Cookie: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Lemon Bar: Too desert-y for me. Sweet and lemony.<br /><br />(Looking at the larabar web site, Peanut Butter Cookie has the most protein, with 7g, at 220 calories and with 4g fiber... I haven't been able to get that in my local stores yet, but that will be the next flavor I try.)<br /><br />Update 2: So I have bought a few flavors by the box now... but I'm realizing I wonder why these aren't cheaper here. They are 1.39 individually in my grocery store, and 1.27 a piece by the box at the current subscribe and save price of 20.28. So yes, that's a savings, but possibly not enough to buy in bulk."
No need for coffee. good value and good energy???,"I think people either love or hate 5-hour energy. IF you're here then you probably love it and as i was, looking for the cheapest place to buy 5hour in bulk.<br /><br />gave it 5stars because 5hour is awesome. The energy feels clean compared to energy drinks and coffee. There really isn't any other way to explain it.<br /><br />I know its against guidelines to talk about price, but this 12-pack of pomegranate was the cheapest at the time. 19 or so with free shipping. IF anyone finds cheaper, PLEASE leave a comment with link to item."
"LOVE these! Great product, Great Value","We get these through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program. They are an excellent natural snack. My son loves them, and Amazon's Subscribe and Save program makes it so easy to keep them stocked in our pantry. Happy Baby does a great job of producing high quality organic baby food at a pretty reasonable price! They are a staple in our house."
Absolutely THE best chip if you love potatoes!,"Always fresh and crisp, lightly salted and the best potato chip ever!  A little thicker than others, never greasy, less calories/fat and as Goldilocks would say .. JUST RIGHT!"
Do You Like Sweet Potato Fries?,"If you like the sweet-salty taste of sweet potato fries, these chips capture the same taste without the fat.  They're low in fat and you can have 12 chips for 140 calories. They're sweet but extremely low in sugar--about 2g. You get 20% of your vitamin A in one serving which isn't bad for a snack.  I bought these for my son for the holidays--he loves sweet potatoes. He enjoyed these. These are much healthier than potato chips and are just as tasty if you like sweet potatoes."
The Original.,"Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: ""When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name."")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley.  Just be careful not to oversteep it: only an exceptionally forgiving tea like, for example, Yunnan, will not turn flat and bitter that way; and with any decent Earl Grey, 2 - 3 minutes should be plenty of steeping time (with Twinings it certainly is)."
Nastiest Sweetener Ever,"Put this in my homemade lemonade, had to throw it out. It is BY FAR the worst non-sugar sweetener I've ever had. It's bitter, oily-tasting and the taste is still in my mouth a full hour after one sip. Going to try either actual stevia (not this extract junk) or an artificial sweetener."
Mesquite seasoning,I bought a container of this stuff years ago at Sam's and FINALLY found more on amazon....it's THE BEST STUFF IN THE WORLD!!!
"Yay, less plastic! Boo, weak coffee!","These smell FANTASTIC! Too bad the coffee is weak. When the machine brews, the last 70% of the stream is hot water. (Every other K-Cup brews fine.)"
Clean Light Uncolored Taste - not Oily,"I first purchased this product to replenish my ""Kalamata Gold"" Greek olive oil supply, which suddenly became unavailable. I use this particular olive oil exclusively for stove-top cooking. I haven't used it in salad dressings, or any other cold dishes; though it is probably an excellent choice for salad dressing.<br /><br />I have at least four different kinds of olive oil in my pantry at any given time. Some are floral, some are fruity, some (now discarded) are overpoweringly oily. Iliada Kalamata Greek EVOO is neither floral nor fruity and certainly not oily on the palette, so it is an excellent choice when one doesn't want the oil to impart much flavor of its own. Again, I use this oil for cooking, but it is likely an excellent choice for dressings."
Great for cats with food allergies!,"When I adopted my second cat, it was discovered that she was suffering from some type of food allergy. After doing some research, I discovered Natural Balance carried a limited ingredients diet. My two cats enjoy the wet and dry food and seem to be doing well on it. The prices are very reasonable and I like the fact that Natural Balance has a ""buy with confidence"" feature so that pet owners can monitor the testing of the food they have purchased. Plus they do not conduct animal testing which a lot of commercial pet foods (Iams, Purina, Nutro) do. I would highly recommend Natural Balance!"
Awesome!,"Just recently found out I have a wheat allergy and we so excited to have something fun to eat again! These were awesome, moist and chewy, I topped them off with some raspberry jam and was in heaven! These will totally be a staple in my gluten free cupboard! Don't forget to visit Pamela's website too there are tons of recipes so you don't ever feel like you're missing out again."
Very good,I've enjoyed this cereal very much. A slight sweet taste but not too much. The texture is a bit different....a smooth texture on the tongue.  It's a good addition to a gluten free diet.
"Healthy, Crunchy, Sweet!","Snackwell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is a snack that is both light and filling. Not overly sweet, but it has a nice milk chocolate and caramel flavor combined with a satisfying crunchiness. I do tend to enjoy a fair amount of caramel corn snacks which almost always have more sugar and chemicals. This is a much healthier alternative. Each bag is consistent, with no hulls or seeds. A very portable, enjoyable and high quality snack. Enjoy!"
Best in Quality and Price,"I was introduced to this dog food over tens years ago. One of the local pet stores recommended it for our golden retriever because of the skin problems that he was experiencing. His skin and coat were back to normal once he had been on this dog food for two weeks. I've been feeding it to all my dogs ever since. I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery. As an aside: My dogs love the taste so much that I have used the kibble as their behavioral treat as well (e.g., sit, stay, etc.) Can't get a better taste review than that!"
Healthy and tasty,"I use this more often than olive oil.  I use olive oil for salad dressings and an occasional stir- fry and this for most all other frying.  It has a light coconut flavor that took my 17 year old son some time to get used to, but he doesn't notice anymore.  I see people buying this in capsules as a supplement!"
This is honestly pretty bad...,"I assumed that everyone complaining was just being picky or unreasonable -- I've bought cheap miso soup packets from Trader Joes that were just fine.  This was good value (or so it seemed) and lower sodium than most other packets I was looking at, so I bought it.  However, it is actually awful.  Really.  The taste is poor, the texture is poor, it's just bad.  At least it's organically bad?<br />Subscription cancelled.  An expensive mistake in retrospect."
very sweet & 5 grams of fat per pastry,I was annoyed that I could not return these(did not know that when I bought them)they are very sweet & have 5 grams of fat each which is not very healthy in my opinion.
Great breakfast cereal,"This was a great deal.  I love this cereal and to buy individual boxes works out way more expensive.  Just make sure you have room to store it in your pantry because you get six at a time.  The cereal tastes very good and don't be put off by the fruit on the box - there isn't any inside, it's just flakes and pieces of bran.  My four year old loves it."
Best treats ever!,"My dogs demand their Yip Yaps everyday when I get home from work. One of my dogs is so old, he only has five teeth left & won't eat hard food but he's the first one to be standing at the counter where the Yip Yaps are kept."
has a nice spicy zing,"This sauce has a nice spicy zing, just like the other two flavors Taco Bell makes. But it is also very creamy like the other sauces, which for some reason was slightly surprising (but I guess it shouldn't have been). The taste also has a slight garlic or horseradish taste to it, but that could be just me. Overall, these sauces are a great way to makes your tacos and many other things you would put a special sauce on taste very different so I recommend them all."
Canidae dog food,"We have some of the smallest chihuahuas and a larger outdoor dog, and both sizes can eat it easily.  The dogs like it, and they seem to know when it arrives.  The only problem I have is that it takes about a week to get here, and I need to remember to order early."
Wonderful Teas,I bought this tea wanting to try something new and was NOT dissapointed.<br />I drink it every morning.
Best There Is,"This rice is the greatest.  We found it in the supermarket but then couldn't get it again.  So we ordered it.  It is perfect, easy to use.  We hate to be without it!  Dee Harris"
Best One So Far...,"This is excellent.  The cherry taste isn't very pronounced though.  My teenage son is happy about that as he dislikes cherries ever since the cherry flavored cough medicine he had when he was little.  My kids all love this.  We eat it plain, with kefir, and with milk.  The peanut butter granola is good too, but I prefer this one with kefir.  We've tried the pumpkin/flax granola and the peanut butter.  While the others are good too, this one has the best taste according to my family."
Great gift for those who don't need anything,"This was a Christmas gift for my father and step-mother, she got a real kick out of identifying the candies from her childhood.  I wasn't with them when they opened it, but she seemed very happy with it.  A good gift to give when there's just nothing else needed."
Can't beat this price!,"I had been looking for this cruet set in local supermarkets without success, so was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price --- especially since I thought I was getting one cruet with two dressing packages, and the price is actually for 2 cruets and 4 seasoning packages! (This is a great price because a single package of dressing mix tends to run about $1.99 in the stores). The cruets are sturdy, come with suggestions for dressing variations, and bring back memories of when my mom used this same cruet to make salad dressing when I was a kid. Definitely recommended --- homemade salad dressing beats store dressing every time!"
Great value green tea powder.,"Although it's not technically matcha, this tea tastes really good in lattes, bakery goods, blended ice drinks, or simply by itself in a hot drink.  Also, you can't beat the price!"
Putting pure coconut oil in a PLASTIC container???,"This is awesome coconut oil, but it is packaged in a PLASTIC container. Plastic can leech into the product. What is the point of putting a health food in contaminating packaging? Change it! Glass is far more acceptable, and will not will not contaminate the product with the estrogens from plastic. We people who use coconut oil will definitely recycle it, like we do everything else.;)"
Impressive Service!,"Aside from the product being as described, and arriving safely and quickly, Joel's went of their way to fix my screw up. I mistakenly put the wrong shipping address on my order. When I got the notice alerting me that the shipment would be sent out that day (nice touch when dealing with delicate contents), I just then realized my error. I emailed, explained the situation, and even though they had already labeled my shipment and were headed to the post office, they pulled my order, re-labled the box, and shipped the items later that day. Now that may not sound like a big deal, but I seriously doubt many sellers would bother to take the time to fix a customer's mistake for a product that probably doesn't have a large profit margin."
My Cat's Favorite Seafood Dinners,Sir Flip loves the taste of Purrfectly Fish. The variety and true fish taste makes him a happy kitty and me an even happier guardian of a cat who used to be a finicky eater. The cost and ease of getting a case [which I've not found in stores]just makes more sense. He's happy and fish oil is great for his coat and skin.
I love this thing,"The wine saver is great in so many ways. Obviously it's wonderful to be able to open a bottle of wine and have it stay good for a day or two, especially if you just like one glass with dinner. This lets you open up and enjoy more expensive wine since you won't waste the whole rest of the bottle. If you are interested in learning about wines, you'll probably want to open up 2 or more wines at a time to compare them, and this way you won't waste anything. The wine saver will keep the undrunk portion until the next time.  I do recommend putting the bottle in the fridge if you don't drink it the next day. Just pull the bottle out an hour before you want to drink it if it's red."
Tasty but slightly hot,"Very tasty. I think it is hotter than original Tabasco. It is really good on eggs. Also very good on El Polo Loco BRC burritos. In fact, that is my main use. Makes fast food Mexican seem promoted up to campy business district lunch place Mexican with their home made salsas."
Terrible - Chicken??,The soup taste terrible.  The picture with big chunks of chicken is extremely misleading. There is almost no chicken in the soup.
worst coffee I ever bought,worst coffee I ever bought.It was so bad tasting I ended up throwing 3 cans in the garbage.Do not waste money buying this coffee.
Absolutely love!!,My husband teases me when we see these on sale at the grocery store.  I LOVE this flavor so much more than any of the others I've tried.  It has just the right amount of carbonation for that soda fix and the flavor is fantastic.  I'm so glad I found it here on Amazon and the subscribe and save price - much better than I could ever find in the grocery store.
Very Impressed!,"I could not believe how fast this product got to me!  They are certainly on top of things over there.  I opened the box and set the bag in the forier.  My cat started acting strange wanting to go outside all of the sudden, then wanting back in, then inspecting the baby stroller (also in the forier).  I didn't put it together until he honed in on the bag and started going crazy.  I was trying to get him to finish his last two bowls of his old food before I opened the new stuff, but from the time he smelled this new food he went on a hunger strike from his old food.  My cat is typically VERY laid back so this was all hilarious to me. After a few hours of him scratching at the bag and refusing his other food, I finally just mixed the last two bowls in and gave him the new Taste of the Wild food.  He inhaled it!  He LOVES this stuff.  I have only had it for a week or so, so I haven't had it long enough to see if it improves his skin and coat, but even if it doesn't, I prefer it to his old food that certainly didnt.  So far, no complaints at all!!!"
love it!,"This is wonderful honey!  A jar of honey normally lasts our family for 6 months, but this jar was gone in a week!  The texture and flavor is terrific!  Thanks honey republic!"
First ingredient is trans fat ( partially hydrogenated oil ),"The ingredient tab on the product page doesn't show what is in this cappuccino.  The very first ingredient when I got my order and reviewed it was trans fat, and not just a little.  This stuff will clog your arteries.  I wouldn't have purchased this had the product info been shown.  I didn't know they still used this stuff.  New York outlawed the stuff and the FDA explicitly makes manufactures show this ingredient.  Shame on Amazon for not displaying this.  I did order addition K-cup coffee. I""ll return them."
Great quality tea!,My wife doesn't drink coffee.  She loves tea and we've tried all different brands.  Two Leaves and a Bud is consistently great and buying in this larger quantity is just a great value.
not for senseo machines,does not work with senseo coffee brewer ... Pods too thick and does not work with double pod holder either.
Surprisingly Good!,"My wife and I are always looking for healthy snacks that don't taste like cardboard. She could probably lose 10 pounds and I should lose 50.  By watching sugars in store bought foods I've been able to lower my sugar from 122 to 102, going from prediabetic to almost normal.  Of course my wife would disagree with anyone referring to anything about me as being 'normal'.  These crisp cookies have a pretty good flavor, are a bit granular and have a slight aftertaste.  Compared to mother's homemade cookies, they don't stack up very well.  But for those like me trying to watch their sugar, fats and sodium, they measure up quite well to similar products."
LOVE RED HOT BLUES!!!,"OK, so before we opted to purchase these from Amazon, my whole family was a fan of these chips and if you never tried them you have too. They are absolutely delicious, spiced up just right, perfect in taco salad, with salsa or just fine all alone (and it helps if your alone too because when sharing these chips are addictive!)<br />But I HAVE TO SAY that these chips purchased through amazon were the best NO EXAGGERATION, that I have had. I thought it was just me but then my husband was like ""i dunno what it is but those chips are GOOODDD!!"" They were fresh, so fresh and this size bags makes it better for snacking/sharing as opposed to the larger bags from the store.<br />Stop reading and order these, your family will thank u :-D"
Excellent strong coffee,"Timothy's Midnight Magic coffee is the best K-cup coffee I've had.  It's great for people who drink espresso, and it has a wonderfully rich flavor."
A favorite,"These are one of my favorite chocolates. The pink part is like strawberry-flavored white chocolate, with one end dipped in chocolate. The shape is like a space capsule, guess that's why it's called Apollo! Delicious, melt in your mouth. I think they're about an inch high, maybe a little less. If you like strawberry flavor with chocolate, and the way chocolate melts in your mouth, you'll love these."
Nice and hot!,These chips are just hot enough to make them interesting.  The only other type of chip that came close was Habanero Dortitos which are hard to find.
"Good taste, small container",This Olive oil has a pretty good flavor.  I purchased w/ subscribe and save to get a 15% discount.  The containers were smaller than i thought so it wasn't a really good price.  Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase and would recommend this product.
Greenie$,"Good product & my dogs love them. But, over priced like most Pet treats.<br />I did get fast delivery & good service as usual."
An Up-sized Gummi Bear: The Gummi Bears Strike Back,"This is the big daddy bear of the Gummi Bears. This Bear has come on the scene to take revenge on all those that have been yumming down too many Gummi Bears.<br /><br />The Revenge takes place on several fronts so be warned!!!!<br /><br />[1] Extra sticky portions are designed to stick between your teeth to give cavities and to try to rotten them out completely.<br /><br />[2] If large bits are taken, the portion will attempt to make you choke.<br /><br />If you are successful in getting this Daddy bear down into your tummy, the revenge continues on a new level:<br /><br />[3] It will make you heavier, 4.5 pounds to be precise.<br /><br />[4] It will make you fatter, 12,500 calories to be precise.<br /><br />[5] It will increase your blood sugar and attempt induce a stroke or diabetes.<br /><br />If you are successfull in digesting the Daddy bear, he has one last trick:<br /><br />[6] Hint: take a very thick book the next time you go the washroom."
All Water Is Not The Same IMO,"I have been drinking filtered water for many years. Ever since I was young I remember growing up drinking distilled water because my Uncle had sold my parents a distiller. Since then I have learned that the mineral content of the water is very important and also lends to a more smooth and refreshing drink. If any of you have tasted distilled water then you know what I mean.<br /><br />When I moved out and purchased my own house, I installed an R.O. filter under my kitchen sink and drank R.O. water for several years. R.O. water like distilled water has had most of the minerals removed during the filtration process. My local tap water has a pH of about 7.6 and a TDS (total dissolved solids) average of about 356 mS. My own R.O. water brought the conductivity down to around 30 mS and the pH to around 7 or slightly less. (I currently use my RO filter along with a de-ionizing filter afterwards to create ultra pure 0 mS TDS water for my Reef Tank) I do not drink it.<br /><br />I was introduced to ""Kangen"" or ""ionized alkaline water"" while I was traveling in Japan. It is water that has been filtered (usually thru a sediment, then a carbon block cartridge) and then run past energized Platinum plates to create 2 water streams. One stream is acidic and one is alkaline. The acid water can be used to clean, water plants and put topically on the skin amongst its many uses. The alkaline water is what you drink. Apparently during the ionizing process the water molecules are also altered. Usually water clusters together in 12 or so molecule clusters, while ionized water has smaller clusters of around 6-8 molecules. Supposedly this allows the water to cross the cell membranes in our bodies easier and promotes more rapid rehydration.<br /><br />Despite all the theories and studies, the real evidence for me is the way the water works for me. Before drinking alkaline water I would get heartburn or acid reflux occasionally after a long day of hard work or after eating certain foods. After several months of drinking alkaline water I never got acid reflux. Three years later since I first started drinking alkaline water I have only had acid reflux maybe twice. I would attribute that to the foods I ate that day and stressful work as well as not drinking the filtered water for several days prior. Alkaline water has improved my health in my opinion and am still drinking and prefer it to any other drinks when I am thirsty. It hasn't however kept me from getting sick occasionally or making me look many years younger. It has overall generally improved my health and I do feel better drinking it on a daily basis.<br /><br />Since I own a several thousand dollar alkaline water ionizer filter and drink the water daily. Own an R.O. filter and water testing equipment and understand a moderate amount of water chemistry principles. I was very curious to try this bottled version of alkaline water and see how it compares.<br /><br />It states on the label that the water has been R.O. filtered. Then minerals have been added back. It lists Sodium Bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. After the minerals have been added back then it is ""alkalized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology. All of this sounds very familiar as this is exactly how alkaline water ionizers work. The water needs to have minerals added back to be able to ionize the water. Here is what I discovered after trying a bottle:<br /><br />Taste: I like the taste of it. It's not bad. It's light and refreshing and very similar to my own alkaline water.<br /><br />Smell: Clean. No noticeable ""off"" odors.<br /><br />Hydration Ability: Better than tap, but, ""nano-clustered"" water supposedly looses its smaller clustering formation over time measured in days. I wonder if the water is still structured the same by the time it gets to us to drink. Didn't seem to refresh quite as well as freshly made alkaline water.<br /><br />pH: Label states a pH of 9.5 which is on par with my ionizer unit which can produce a range of pH strengths from 7.0 to 12.0 I usually drink alkaline water with a pH of 9.<br /><br />Overall I like the water and would choose it first over any other bottled water at the connivence store. Its benefits would be the fact that it is filtered, has a proper mineral content (unlike distilled and RO water only), and has an alkaline pH. It's limitations to me seem to be the age of it thus potentially losing its small water clustering, as well as the plastic bottle is comes in. Many alkaline water aficionados recommend using glass containers first, stainless steel second and BPA free plastic third as the hierarchy of best water vessels to use. While not providing all the benefits of freshly made alkaline ionized water, it does provide a good many of them. Currently a 12 pack of 1.5L bottles on Amazon cost $28.75 and this translates to roughly $0.80 per 16 oz of water, which is not bad compared to $1.25 16 oz bottles at my local store. I think the 1.5 liter is a good size and a good quantity of water to drink per day of this water for most people. That amount to $2.40 per 1.5L bottle. I make my own for pennies on the dollar, but when including the initial investment of purchasing the ionizer along with replacement filter costs, buying these bottles will be cheaper for a long payback period. However if getting the absolute full benefits of alkaline ionized water is very important, you may want to consider purchasing an ionizing unit. These also would be a good way to test drinking this type of water before purchasing your own unit. In conclusion I think Essentia water is making a very good attempt to bring the benefits of alkaline ionized water to more people and I would purchase it over any other bottled waters."
Healthy and economical,"Organic beans that are not canned are difficult to find in most stores so this 6 pkg. buy was great.  I cook big batches ahead of time and freeze them in typical recipe sizes.  Then I pull them out as needed.  For someone who believes organic is important, this is a great economical way to do beans for chili, soups, or even 'refried' beans.  They are big, healthy looking beans."
Taste and consistency appear more to the real thing,"I grew up in the tropics where the best shade at the beach is from a palm tree. Of course, you gotta look up first to inspect if there are coconuts above. It might be dangerous when ripe. Oh! but locals climb palm trees to harvest the fruit.  With a machete they open up the top and voila, a super refreshing 40 to 50 calories drink.<br /><br />Zico water reminds me of the flavor tasted. I purchase it in Safeway and/or Trader Joe's ( I live in California now). Relatively cheap and likely the real thing without so much processing.<br /><br />I recommend it. Trust me. It is good. ;0)"
Soldiers love it,We support a number of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and several of them request peppered jerky above everything else.
Jolly Time has the Best Popcorn Salt,"Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning for Popcorn.  Just call it THE Popcorn Salt.  It's fine grained, doesn't clot and has a taste that doesn't overwhelm you.  Most ""buttery"" popcorn salts are too much this or too much that.  There are even a few that you have to refrigerate!<br /><br />My local Fred Meyer stopped selling the Jolly Time Popcorn about a year ago.  I've tried to get them to reorder it but they'd rather sell their own store brand.  I've tried every other popcorn salt I can find in the local stores but they're no good.  I'm glad to finally find it here on Amazon. I've used Jolly Time for nearly 10 years, so you can imagine how I stick to products I enjoy."
Knorr All Purpose Seasoning,"Love this stuff, especially on eggs.  Can't find it in store's anywhere, so I was glad to find it on line.<br />My product was shipped right away."
love these sweet sweeties,I eat a dried persimmon slice for dessert each night and also steep in tea for my heartburn....I love these and appreciate how sweet and not-too-chewy they are
If you have a Lab - this is the treat,My labradore can chew through any toy.  Nylabone is the only product I have found that he can play with for a very long time.
Gummy worms are fun,I bought this so that I could re-enact the downfall of Jennifer Connelly in Requiem for a Dream. Works great
"these are good, but","I first tried this AWESOME cookies in Spain.  They were so good!  However they are not widely available at home in the US.  I was pleased to fine them on Amazon.  However, when I recieved the package, the cookies were sub par.  The chocolate was likt they had been left in a hot room for days on end before shipping."
Quality dog food,"My dogs are picky but they do eat Canidae, not the no grain Canidae, but this one.  Canidae has a premium dog food, canned and dry. Get what you pay for with this product."
terrible quality... soggy and soft,"I've bought this item before and it was fine. I reordered and this shipment is either old, sat too long in a warm warehouse, or was somehow subjected to humidity. The lifesavers are soggy and soft and terrible."
Nice flavour,"I like this coffee, its nice to drink it in the morning. It has medium body and full flavour. Goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk."
Great cup of coffee!!,"I don't like the burnt taste of Starbucks, so we ordered this coffee.  It comes out perfect on the 10 oz setting!  We are ordering more today."
Too Early to tell,"I used it twice so far, once with Peanut butter & the second time with a carrot, and both times it failed. I thought I had set it up properly, but maybe not. I tried the poison peanuts with a point type applicator sold elsewhere here & killed both a Gopher which had eluded me in the past with 4 other type traps, and I also killed 2 other moles all with 1st try.  I may give this Box another try in the future, but the poison works best for me. Ernest Riedel, Bushnell,FL"
super yummy!!,"these cookies are super yummy! I love how they can be a quick, tasty and healthier on the go breakfast option.My whole family loves them!"
Very Soft and Fresh!,"I've purchased vanilla beans in stores before and they were awful.  Either hard or stiff and difficult to cut.  I was thrilled to find these so soft, pliable and fragrant!<br /><br />I ordered these to make homemade vanilla extract.  I will DEFINITELY order from here again!"
My Favorite K-Cup,"My favorite K-Cup flavor! A mild rather than a strong coffee strength, it really has a flavor reminiscent of a local donut shop or Denny's cup of coffee.<br />Highly recommended!"
Donuts for me,"Eating gluten free keeps me healthy.  Eating donuts is satisfaction for the appetite.  To a package of Ener-G Foods Donut Holes, I shake in some cinnamon & sugar, eat some of the donut holes, and I am happy.  With a faint taste of orange, these donut holes could be tossed with powdered sugar, or dipped in frosting.  Be careful, these treats can become addicting!"
Too much like Baking Choc.,"As far as choc. goes this really good. But someone who reviewed should have explained it is so close to baking choc. you can't hardly tell the difference. Since I bought this I have experminted, and between 60 and 70 % is good for a dark chocalate lover.<br />Randy"
tasty steak nuggets,"These are pretty good, but a little overpriced - I would only buy if there was a promotion. Some pieces are deliciously tender and seasoned perfectly, but there usually are more that are too dried out and tough, or overseasoned."
Healthy family,"I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great."
The search has ended!,I had been looking for the violet candy with the perfect balance of sweet and floral when I tried these.<br />The search has ended.<br />I am very pleased.
"I love the ""Little Bites"" but not so much the flavor","I am a big fan of Mini-Wheats. I eat them often for breakfast. I have tried the frosted and plain, but never anything with a flavor. I was curious to try this one.<br /><br />First, I love the ""little bites"" size. I find they are easier to eat, they don't get as soggy as fast and they fit on my spoon! I also like the fact that it appears to fill up a bowl more, even if that's just my perception.<br /><br />I liked the sweetness that the cinnamon roll flavor added. I could certainly tell it just wasn't a cinnamon flavor, but a vanilla one, too. Sadly, there was also something very manufactured about the taste. Maybe it was an aftertaste or just some flavor that I wasn't expecting, but I didn't love it.<br /><br />I am going to stick with my normal frosted version. I like that much better."
Great Chips!,"I absolutely love Pop Chips.  Cheddar is my favorite, but I thought I'd try these cause I like Parmesan too.  Just a word of caution....you'd better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor. All in all, these are great chips if you're watching your weight.  They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips."
the best tea in the world,PG Tips is the best tea in the world. I usually find it in local stores but the prices have gone up recently and this bulk packaging is much more affordable in the long run. Thank you!!!
Major Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline of Events,"As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.<br /><br />Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning<br /><br />Event..........Date..........Time<br />Order from Amazon..........2/11/2011<br />Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011<br />Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

Just Right Blend,"This stuff's great, especially, as suggested by its name, first thing in the morning. It's not too dark, but it's not so mild that you don't feel like you've had a cup of coffee.<br />We think it tastes even better made with bottled water.<br />Order with confidence."
Great for what it is,"I live in the heart of the peach district, in the second largest peach=producing state, most years. We make peach tea with real, fresh, tree-ripened peaches. This is not that. It is a tasty beverage--very useful when you are traveling to doctor water that is not the best-tasting, or just to make a refreshing diet beverage on the go--you can slip this in your purse or shirt pocket (well, my dad does, anyway), and you're good to go. The best thing, for me, is that I can easily control the strength of the drink--I usually dilute Crystal light to half strength because it's just too sweet for me--here I can add one drop instead of two and get just the right strength to flavor a bottle of water or large glass of water."
Best Margarita in a bag!,"We've used Lt. Blender's Sugar Free Margarita in a Bag for about 5 years now. We love the flavor and ease of this product. Follow the instructions as written and you'll enjoy sweet, sugar free margaritas. This mix is not bitter or sour ~ it's tasty and perfect when served with lime wedges. Perfect for tailgating, river tubing, camping, etc. Amazon.com has the best price and free shipping. Cheers!"
Defective Containers,"On delivery,product containers leaked product. There was no observable damage to the container UPS delivered. The way product is packaged from supplier, it would be difficult for the disstributor to know if internal packages were defective. There is not a good way to advise the supplier of defects, only to ask for refunds or replacement. Who wants the problems of sending one 2 0z package back for refund or replacement??? Other than the above, I find the products very good, and will reorder again."
Smells great and that's about it...,"I had never realized how popular Dunkin' Donuts coffee was until I saw all these ""donut"" k-cup coffee clones.  I've tried Dunkin Donuts, Donut Shoppe and Donut House varieties.  The Donut House flavor is the mildest/smoothest of the 3 with a muted bitter aftertaste and, of the 3, I like it the least.  The Donut House brand comes in 2 additional flavors, Chocolate Donut and Cinnamon.  Both are flavored additions of their base coffee.<br /><br />The Cinnamon Roll smells fantastic while brewing and hints at the promise of sweet tasting coffee.  Alas, that hint is all you get.  The coffee tastes the same as the base mild/smooth Donut House coffee flavor but has a slight (very slight) cinnamon flavoring (not sugar cinnamon like on toast, certainly not a ""cinnamon roll"" taste, but more like they sprinkled actual cinnamon spice into the coffee).<br /><br />I use 10oz mug sizes so I tried an 8oz size to see if that affected the taste.  It did make for a stronger coffee taste but the flavor tasted the same, maybe slightly more bitter.<br /><br />It's not a bad coffee, and I kinda like the milder flavor for evening drinking but if I get it again, I'll stick with the Donut House plain flavor."
great product,I love organic Hemp oil mixed in to my homemade Italian dressing. It keeps the olive oil from solidifying as hard in the fridge. That way I dont have to think to remove it an hour before dinner.
Carbons Waffle Mix,"I have used it over the last year and find that it is great.  One 16oz. container makes about 5 waffles.  I had to tweek the label recipe by adding water as theirs came out thick.  The waffles are consistently good.  We have used the waffles with syrup, ice cream and fried chicken, all tasting great. If writing this uplifting review gets me a dozen complimentary cans they will be gladly accepted."
Happy homemaker.,"We have been using Good Seasons dressing mix for years & as far as I am concerned there is none better, especially the Cheese Garlic.  I had to buy it over the internet because none of our local stores carried it anymore.  They only stock the Italian flavors. Go figure.  I am totally happy with this product."
Great tasting coffee,"Like most coffee drinkers, I know Kona is a special coffee bean, and this brand offers great taste. At my local coffee shop, I often pick Kona when it is offered as the flavor of the day. While the coffee shop Kona is better than an average coffee, it did not seem to be anything special, and I could guess they do not sell true Kona, but a blend.  So I decided to try a true 100% Kona and picked Hawaiian Roasters.  I am very happy with this purchase---might be the best coffee I have ever had.  The flavor is strong and there is no after-taste issue.  I picked the medium roast and I plan to try the dark roast next."
"great taste, more fat than i expected",Tastes great and I'll happily finish the box but my mistake for not checking the nutritional info more carefully before ordering... 15g of fat per bar is pretty damn high. I was hoping for a protein snack that was pretty lean otherwise. This is sweet and delicious but not as 'healthy' as I was hoping for.
A large helping of Mojito fun!,"This is a fun drink.  It fits well into the Crystal Light family of drinks and as ""Moctails"" go is a good approximation of a Mojito.  It's just tart and lime enough with a hint of mint and looks good in a tall glass with a little umbrella.  It's obviously not a real Mojito with fresh mint and cane sugar but it's passable.  My main issue is the size, the packets make a half gallon each!  This make this really only good for parties because my wife and I just can't finish 8cups of mojito in a day."
Too Weak For My Taste,"I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though."
Baby Tested.  Momma Approved!  :),My 16-month-old LOVES these squeezey packs!  They are best for long car trips when you don't want to stop and pull out a meal's worth of food.  My little one will happily suck on it while we drive.  :)
Dried chicken strips made in China,"Due to all the publicity surrounding the questionable quality of dried chicken strips from China, I have thrown out this order (it is not worth the money to return it).  I will not be reordering them.  I will only be ordering dog treats made in the USA."
"Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar","The Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar is superb.  We use it in the kitchen (for cooking, baking + pastry crusts), and for our skin and hair. See: ""The Coconut Oil Miracle"" book.<br /><br />Also, this 54 ounce jar is a better buy--not only because the purchase contributes to less packaging waste on the planet--but this larger quantity calculates to more cost effectiveness per ounce."
Refreshingly tasty and authentic,"I buy a lot of frozen dinners, including meals featuring Indian curries.<br />Out of them all- I prefer anything by Tandoor Chef because of the portion size and the amazingly authentic Indian taste. I found them at my local grocery store and have been hooked since. I saw the amazing deal on Amazon and decided to order these. They arrived within a day, however, they held only one ice pack. For a 12 pk order- I expected one more ice pack.<br />These frozen dinners are great for people like me watching portion size and caloric intake. Indian curries are notoriously high in calories, but this specific one is 315 kcal. It's a great way to enjoy Indian food on a diet.<br />I recommend Tandoor Chef Chicken Tikka Masala as well- although that one is 400 kcal. The curry is always more than the rice- you can always cook extra rice to go with the meal.<br />Lastly, the best thing about them is the taste!"
I like it,"You need to wait for some time to get the cereal soaked in the milk and then it would taste awesome. Overall, one of my favorites."
Delicious coffee!,"Very pleased with this coffee, but there are so many others like it. I would buy it again if price would come down."
MOLEINATOR INSTA KILL....,WOW THIS PRODUCT WORKED IN UNDER AN HOUR. I FOLLOWED THE YOUTUBE VIDEO AND SET THE TRAP IN MY FRONT YARD AND BAMM...HAD ONE IN UNDER 1 HOUR.
Loving my coconut chips!,"Great crispy texture, delicately sweet flavor.  Large enough portion for sustained snacking.  I can imagine it would be awesome in combination with other sweet things, like cakes or ice cream.  Chips are long, slightly curled, and narrow, about 0.5cm-1cm in thickness by 1.5-5cms in length."
My son loves these,My son loves all the happy Tot foods we have tried. If he see's me putting them away he gets so excited and wants one right then.
Tastes great for what it is,I personally don't care for overly sweet cereals but this has to be better than some of the kiddie cereals.<br />I found it too sweet and prefer to mix it with an unsweetened high fiber cereal or oats. That takes the sweet edge off.<br />If you have a young one who loves the sugary marshmallow type cereals perhaps this could help with the transition to more adult cereals.<br />If you are trying to cut down on sugar in general this cereal isn't for you.
Puppy loves them but...,"I was looking for a safe alternative to rawhide that was made in the USA.  These fit the bill.  My puppy loves them and they last for a long time.  She will gnaw on them for hours.  The one drawback however is that they stink so bad!  I mean really, really bad!"
Disgusting!,This tea tastes nasty.  Maybe I just dont like sage but it made me gag!
Pantry Beetles like it anyway...,"I tried Swheat Scoop after our adopted stray produced four unexpected little kittens. Figuring it would be a safe training litter, we bought a big bag of it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- It has generally the same consistency as regular litter, making the transfer from ""kitten box"" to ""big kitty box"" much easier.<br /><br />- There seemed to be much less dust than with clay litter.<br /><br />- Flushable<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Takes awhile to dissolve in the toilet before you can flush<br /><br />- Clumps are gummy for a long time until they harden, which after, is like cement.<br /><br />- As mentioned by another user, there is a ""fermenting dough"" smell. I cleaned out the box every day, but with four kittens and a full grown cat, the smell was unavoidable. That, and it's just a really strange smell that makes people go ""What IS that?"" when they catch a whiff of it. Rather embarassing.<br /><br />- Pantry beetles! If you have larder or pantry beetles in your area and they overwinter indoors, watch out.<br /><br />In my case, they were just drawn to the box, and to the bag that held the clean litter. I'd find the beetles in every stage of growth, especially the larvae. It can be very hard to get rid of them, even if you keep your house meticulously neat, as they burrow down into the carpet where you can't see them. After doing a bit of research (I didn't know what they were and called them ""dirtybugs"") I found out that they like to get into grains. (Which explains why I found some once at my boyfriend's old apartment in a box of Wheat-Thins) So, clean the area, clean it often, and kep any extra littler in a covered bin.<br /><br />I give the product 3 stars because it's a natural litter that's not too different from regular litter, but it loses points for the ""fermenting dough"" smell and the bugs."
Flavor Trip,"This tablets were really fun to try out. My parents, my siblings, and my friends all loved them and were so confused on how well they worked. Do not drink store bought orange juice though! It was sickly sweet because of the sugar added and the acid in it! My favorite was fresh pineapple and sucking on limes. (Limes were sweeter for me than the lemons)"
just what i was looking for...,"...great to grab a handful for a snack, or with oatmeal in the morning. will order again soon. very good product."
Favorite Treats Ever!,My dog loves these treats more than anything else. They are a nice change from the dry biscuit or meat flavored treats. This shipped in a timely manner. The lid has to twist all the way off in order to get treats out.
I Love This Coffee!,"Ok, I was a little irritated, when I found out our local supermarket no longer carries this brand. I had to resort to buying it online. If I didn't like it so much I wouldn't have even bothered. Wonderful coffee!"
good deal,"Now I know what a pound of catnip looks like. I just cracked it open and the cat is going bonkers. I hope I get through the whole thing before it (if it) goes stale. Good price if you don't have the weed growing around your home, and an effective product."
"Salt-Free Brown Rice Cakes, Ultra-Thin","I like these flat square cakes because they are easier to spread jam, nut butter on than other traditional cakes.  Also they are more compact & don't crumble/crumb as easily.  Good for a snack in the car/on-the-go. Good value; easy to store.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because I don't know about quality, pesticides used in Czech Republic where they are made.  Would prefer organic. Other Info:<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% Wholegrain Brown Rice<br />26 cakes per package; 20 calories each<br />Kosher-Pareve<br />Manufactured in Czech Republic"
If you love tea,I tried this tea about a year ago and loved it.  Glad to find it online for such a great price.
Very tasty!,"Very tasty. But as a word of caution. Do not over eat these bears. When the label warns you it may have a laxative affect, BELIEVE IT! otherwise enjoy!"
"My favorite low fat, no caffine instant drink.",This drink is delicious.  My grocery store stopped carrying it  but Amazon will ship it to me.  I even like having a case for back up.  I drink it everyday.  I recommend buying it this way.
great for italian soda,I love this stuff as I own a frig converted to hold four 5 gallon soda canisters 3 of which I use for beer mead and hard cider which I make<br />So the 4th is used for making Italian soda from this syrupas now once again I can drink soda that does not cause diabeties unlike the HFCS infested soda which is about all you can get in the USA
Depends on your taste,"This is one that truly seems to depend on your taste in coffee.  I served it to five people at the office because I personally love it.  Two of them said they couldn't finish the cup, while the other three thought it was the best they've had. I personally like the more traditional taste of brewed coffee that this product produces.  The plastic k-cups always seemed to have an awkward taste to them, almost as if I wasn't really drinking coffee.  I do get a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the cup, but also don't mind that.  Since it does turn the inside of my white cup pretty black, I suppose I should also start thinking about what it's doing to my teeth and my insides, but the flavor seems to make it all worthwhile anyhow.  At the office it was clearly a love it or hate it type reaction - this from four people who usually choose a bold coffee and one who always drinks light (but happened to love this)."
Great coffee and great price!!,I have used Amazon many times for K-cups for my Keurig and every time I am satisfied with both the price and the item that I get.  This is just another case of a great coffee at a great price!
Mothers cookies are great!,"I have been buying Mothers Cookies from Amazon, and they all are excellent.  My most recent purchase of Mothers Iced Oatmeal cookies are great!"
Only rawhide my dog will chew,"Okay, my chihuaha is finicky...i have wasted lots of money on other rawhide chews and finally found one! Thank you beefeaters."
nice,"My small mixed breed enjoys the flavor and gets very excited when treated with these. The smell is a nice mint, which many dogs seem to like mint surprisingly. These treats are tough which makes them more rewarding for my pup that likes to chew things apart. They last longer than most treats."
NO DENTED CANS,I recieved my order with no dented cans.  What happened to $12 a case it's now $16.  My dog owning friends say it's still a good price.
Cats Love Them!,A friend who owns a pet store recomended Bil-Jac treats and my cats love them!!  My cats are pretty picky about treats but these they loved!
Yum!,I was very happy with both the caviar and the company. The shipment arrived next day well packaged and with wonderfully reusable freezer packs. The caviar was fresh and extremely tasty. I would certainly order from them again.
Just NOT like sugar!,"Sorry, but this has a gritty taste, not sweet & certainly not like sugar in any way. Would NOT use for anything. Was really excited to try it as it has no sugar alcohols, which bother me, but this isn't the answer..."
Fresh salsa from a jar!,This stuff is great!  I love to buy fresh salsa but it doesn't last long.  This stuff comes out of a jar but it tastes like the fresh stuff from the refrigerated section.
Just like fresh squeezed lemons,"This is now one of my favorite ""pantry"" items!  I cook with fresh lemon juice very frequently and not only does it take time to squeeze enough fresh lemons to obtain the amount of juice I need, it can also be difficult to find high quality, fresh lemons and store them.  Reconstituted, concentrated lemon juice is simply not close to the flavor of fresh lemons so I was thrilled to find Sicilia.<br /><br />Its flavor is unmatched for recipes like chicken piccata or lemon sauce for artichokes.  Truly it tastes like someone picked fresh lemons from a tree in Sicily, squeezed the juice and delivered it to your door ready to use."
Good stuff and sugar free,"Sugar free and aspartame free, this cherry flavoring is just right to add to a bottle of water.  Just add and shake and you get a fantastic flavor drink.  Great for those on a diet and looking to avoid aspartame intake."
Mixed feelings,"I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste."
Best Chai in the East,"I used to buy Big Train Vanilla Chai all the time from a local coffee shop when I lived in the mountains of North Carolina. However, after I moved I could not find anything that compared to it. All the usual chain coffee shops just couldn't match their quality. So I decided to start buying my own. If I am using a cup that holds 12 oz of liquid, I usually heat 6 oz of water, 6 oz of milk, and add 2 scoops of chai for an excellent combination."
Ready to eat meals.,"I received this product through the Amazon Vine program and had occasion to try it on my recent trip to San Diego from Seattle (1300 mile drive).  I thought that this would be a great time to try it as there are long stretchs of I-5 that do not have places to eat.  Crossing from Oregon into California, I stopped at a very scenic reststop and decided to try the Gopicnic meal that I had brought with me.<br /><br />Here are the plus items:<br /><br />Nothing needed refrigeration<br />The box is well designed so that you can close it back up easily<br />Every item is individually wrapped so that you can eat only a portion of it if you want without risking spoiling the remaining items.<br />There is no chemistry list in the food listings<br />There is trivia written in the box to help keep you amused as you eat.<br />The chocolate piece is dark chocolate and is very good.<br /><br />Here is what I found a bit lacking:<br /><br />The six Ritz like crackers are not very filling<br />The salmon spread was fishy tasting, smelling, and also had a very runny texture.  The lime flavoring that it was supposed to have did not come through the fishy taste.<br />The salted edame were very bland and are apparently an acquired taste.  I have had them before with spicy flavorings and there were fine.  Just salt though does not do much for me.<br />The trail mix was supposed to be ginger flavored, but I could not really taste it.<br /><br />Perhaps the other varieties of this product might be better, but I would not recommend this one."
a quick meal,"We have loved Kraft Tangy spaghetti for years, but there is one thing they need to improve are the noodles!"
Cin Ful Nut is Awesome,"Just got this coffee today !  Very delightful !  Slight cinnamon, nut and vanilla flavors go great with cookies or your favorite treat. Also a treat just by itself. *Heads Up*,  Found this really rich , so I brewed my next pot (10 Cup) with 1/2 caff and 3 tsp of Cin Cul Nut.  I do like a strong cup of joe, and the above method worked well.  I will order this again, so I have plenty to share : )"
Rip Off,"9 of 24 were the same thing:  Caramel Vanilla Cream.  And yes, it tastes horrible.  Actually, over half the items were French something, and the rest of the items you got only one of each.  Nor did they come in a box, I got a brown paper bag that someone had thrown whatever hadn't sold well into.  This wasn't an assortment, it was leavings.<br /><br />Both Gloria Jean and Amazon could have done this much better."
Yummy!,"These were wonderful. I don't know how they make these so crunchy and airy at the same time. I bought a 16 pack box of these and got in the habit of having a bag (only 120 calories for 4 good-sized cookies) of these every afternoon when I got sluggish. I began to look forward to their cinnamony taste and was bummed when I finally finished all of them. I tried to make some like them and it was a sad failure so just a couple of days ago, I ordered another box of these and the Sugar cookies (they are wonderful, too!) and I even ordered the Oatmeal ones so I can try those and see if they are as good as the others. I highly recommend these!"
Rasberry Raw revolution bar YUCK,"The bar looks good on the ingredients list, but it tastes bad. It has an oil film all around it. To eat these every day I could not do it, if it were a survival situation I could probably choke them down as the have no after taste thanks to the oil film."
Do NOT get me near these!,I ordered some of these and literally ate them each day through all 24 packs.  They are addicting and delicious.
Beyond My Expectations,"I read the review and I was hestitant as it was reported the drawer did not come out easy.  Well, it comes out easy.  I have room for plenty of choices in the drawer as my family likes hot chocolate and tea.  Personally I like coffee. The best thing is that it is a space saver.  I put the Kcup machine on it and I have plemnty of room for condiments.  With other storage syatems you place it next to the Kcup machine.  This takes a lot of spce.  Space is important in my cottage which is now my home.  I think this was a great buy for me.  It is funny how sometimes you buy something and it turns out to be a dud.  This is definitely worth the money."
The best Progresso soup I've had so far,"I've tried the majority of the Progresso soups, and this light beef pot roast has been the best one so far. The dominant ingredients include chunks of ground beef, tomatoes, carrots, celery, peas, green beans, and potatoes. The celery and green beans suffer from the never-ending Progresso symptom of being too mushy once warmed up, but the rest of the vegetables have come out perfect the times I've had this soup. The potatoes in particular are the perfect texture and consistency, and the ground beef is a very welcome and tasty alternative to Progresso's usual chicken, which typically dominates their non-vegetarian soups. The flavor is not bland like some and not too strong and has been just right when I've had it. The solid ingredients are plentiful and packed into the can, although I did not experience the same degree of satiation after eating this as I have from other Progresso soups. Because this is a ""light"" soup and a Weight Watchers item, it's relatively healthy compared to some of the other Progresso soups, having comparably low amounts per serving of Calories (80), sodium (490 mg), and cholesterol (10 mg). Definitely worth trying and as mentioned, a really nice alternative to the other chicken-dominated soups. Check out my picture to see what the soup looks like in the bowl."
Best yeast for home brewing,"Wyeast liquid smack packs are the best yeast for the home brewer because they offer a wide variety of strains so you can taylor fit it to the type of batch you are making. I have used dry yeast in 2 previous batches, Wyeast in an American wheat I just brewed, and White Labs liquid yeast in a raspberry cream ale I just did. The problem with White Labs is that it comes in a test tube looking vial, and you really have no idea if the yeast is ok. With the smack pack, it inflates to show you the yeast is healthy and incubated. I will use only Wyeast from now on!!"
not the best for my cat,"I got this for my cat, thinking it was 'human grade', grain free, hence good for my cat. I realized the marketing is aimed at human sensibilities because it certainly looks and smells good enough for 'people' food.<br />It may be great for some cats, but mine gained 2 lb since she's been eating this and I was feeding her much less than suggested. She also developed urinary problems. My vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition, tried calling Weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories, because many of her feline patients were eating Weruva and gaining considerable weight. The staff at Weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and I couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food. I tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything -- I got the same dismissive response. Pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great, human-grade, grain free food'. While I've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it, if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on Weruva, think twice about buying it."
Yummy Strawberry Milk,Got these for our daughter - she loves the Horizon Organic Chocolate milk so we thought we'd give these a try!  She loves these just as much!  Love that they don't have to be refridgerated.
Bought this for the Fiber,"Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves..."
Meal Replacement Bars,"My husband is on a Doctor supervised medical meal replacement diet.  I'm doing it with him with over the counter products.  This bar is really good.  I use them as snacks, as well.  I eat half a bar for a mid morning and mid afternoon snack.  Sometimes I skip the afternoon and eat the second half for an after dinner snack.  It's very tasty - not at all griddy, and satisfies the body's need for protein, and my sweet tooth.  I eat a regular food meal (low cal!) for dinner.  Please do NOT do this without letting your doc know - especially if you have diabetes, or any other medical issues.  My doc has done bloodwork and is monitoring my progress so she can cut down my diabetes and other meds as needed.  So far I've cut my metformin in half, and my cholesterol and triglicerides have come down amazingly!  Enjoy!"
k-cups,"Great coffee. I love this k-cup flavor. Delicious full bodied coffee for bold coffee lovers, doesn't disappoint. I always buy in bulk, because the price per cup decreases, but also because I KNOW I'm going to drink a lot. Love this coffee!"
Nice Plant but hard to grow,This came nicely packaged and is a good seller. But be aware<br />that this is one of the harder plants to grow. You have to<br />have a green thumb and no how this likes to be watered. I lost mine about 1 month after I got it.... Good luck with yours!
Cats meow for it,Our 2 Cats enjoy breakfast with Newman's Own and somedays they seem to be smiling.  Definte good attitudes result and their fur keeps smooth.  No upset stomachs!
The way to start your day!,"Love this stuff. Tastes so good I actually crave it.  I like it best with a little less water than it calls for.  So nutritious and gives you lots of energy.  Amazon has it for a great price, too."
Great Present`,Great for holiday gift giving when you do not live near the people you're sending to. :-D
"Excellent product, excellent process!","We love French roast coffee and my husband must drink decaffeinated coffee.  His doctor recommends against all the standard variety decaf coffees as the caffeine is removed by a chemical process which the doctor does not like for long term health reasons.<br /><br />We discovered this ""Swiss process"" coffee in Canada last summer, bought it and loved it.  The taste is excellent for all those who love French roast coffee and one cannot guess it is decaffeinated.  We searched the internet for Swiss process decaf coffees and were delighted to find the Kicking Horse decaf on the Amazon site.  All our friends who have had it have enjoyed it as well.<br /><br />We have signed up for the procedure of having it shipped to us automatically once a month, and even save money doing so.  The price is right for this excellent product.<br /><br />We highly recommend it to all!"
Smaller than expected,Product arrived quickly but was smaller than it looked as pictured on the web site.
Coffee at its best,"Senseo Single-Serve Coffee Machine Gift Pack, Raven Black<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI"">Senseo Douwe Egberts Dark Roast Coffee Pods, 18-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />I've been using Senseo coffee maker and pods since it was introduced to the American market.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase and some of my friends bought the machine after they tried the coffee at my house."
Yummmm!,"I like many of Amys foods. LOVE her Golden Lentil. This one is very tasty! I add a dash of Cajun spice & Jonnys just to add more spice & a few crumbled triscuits to really kick it up! Yes I reccomend! For those who feel its too bland...Just add some more spices, if its too spicy then perhaps try the mild. Thanks Amys for making some great stuff & Amazon for making it more affordable for us!"
Great Machine - Horrible Coffee,"These machines are great, unfortunately the coffee used in the Douwe Egberts pods is horrible.  I was going to get rid of my machine until a friend brought over some different pods.  I suggest spending a little extra money and buying quality pods - the difference is markedly different.  I personally buy mine from www.familyroast.com as they have a cool story but lots of people are making pods that fit this machine now.  For what its worth - I hope it helps."
So far so great!,"When I brought home my Linney a couple of weeks ago, the shelter sent her home with a brand new bag of Science Diet, which all the cats at the shelter had been living on. I've been reading a lot about cat nutrition lately, and I ultimately plan on changing her to 100% wet food, no dry. I wanted to keep her on a pretty normal feeding routine for the first month or so, however, since she is going through so many changes already. I knew I wanted to get her off Science Diet (corn and animal by-products? And they are vet recommended?!?) ASAP, so after some research I thought Wellness Dry would be the best choice to at least get her off the crap food and on the way to a natural diet, while giving her as little stress as possible.<br /><br />I transitioned slowly, adding 25% more Wellness each night until she was transferred.  There were no issues with getting her to eat it, she loves the taste and transitioned very easily. She's been on 100% Wellness for about four days now, and already I am seeing an incredible difference in her overall appearance. I honestly thought I wouldn't see that big a change, as she never really had any issues. Her condition now, such a short time after switching, is amazing. Her coat, beautiful to begin with, is incredible. It's so unbelievably soft, like the softest ermine. Her eyes are brighter. She hardly sheds at all, has stopped itching as much, and she actually seems calmer and has a better night-time routine than before. I'm being humble when I say she was quite flawless before, but this diet has turned her into something extraordinary.<br /><br />Just by looking at the two you can see how superior Wellness is to Science Diet. The biggest observation is the fact that there is no coating of oily fat on the Wellness food, unlike on the Science Diet. 'Junk' brands spray their kibble with a fatty coating, which makes the food irresistible to the cat, and also adds a lot of problems, namely overeating and obesity. There is no such spray on the Wellness, and Linney loves it just as much, I am very pleased to say.<br /><br />I am going to be taking her off this food eventually, as odd as it seems to say after such a rave review. From what I have gathered, a wet diet is the best thing for a cat and it is what I intend to do. Still, I don't think I could have found a better transition diet for her, and I couldn't be happier, and neither could Linney, for that matter."
Never Fails,"The secret to great Japanese curry is to mix the roux.  I usually mix this with the kokumaro brand and it comes out great.  If you are vegetarian, like I am, replace some of the water with coconut milk to make it richer."
Cookie Monster,"Love them, very ""gingery"".  Great with your favorite tea or coffee.  Love that they are using natural ingredients."
first encounter,"The variety, not the brand, was recommended by a friend. Five stars is given with the caveat that other brands were not tried for comparison. The Choice Organic Russian Caravan blend seems to be the only such blend easily available in tea bags.  The unit cost of the product is an excellent value here on amazon, compared to other sellers' offers.<br /><br />The tea is a bit more delicate than one might expect, based on description. Steeping five minutes is recommended, for a full-flavored experience.  The flavor is delightful -- a good black tea, but with a distinctive smoky quality."
Love in a cup!,"If you like a full, rich, and chocolatey cup of coffee, this is for you.<br /><br />Not only is it delicious, you can feel good about drinking it -- it's organic and fair trade.<br /><br />The beans are so fresh and oily when you open the bag. The aroma is only is only surpassed by the taste!<br /><br />Lastly, you can't beat Amazon's price.  They sell this coffee at my local market, but using Subscribe & Save it's about $2 cheaper a bag here.  YUM!  Give it a try!"
Awesome chilis,"This is going to read like an ad for the company, but rarely have I been so completely satisfied by a product.  I was specifically looking for dried habanero chilis that I could grind myself for a variety of uses.  I had never purchased from this company before and was concerned that the peppers would be leathery and not really dry enough for my grinders to work correctly.  No worries!  These chilis were exactly what I was looking for.  They were perfectly dried and I was able to grind them very easily into the different consistencies that I need for my various uses (jerky, salsas, etc.)  The peppers are first rate: the flavor is awesome - the perfect habanero combimation of smokiness and buttery heat.  It is obvious that they started out with only the finest fresh chilis and dried them to perfection.  Not only that, but the delivery was faster than promised and the packaging was excellent as the peppers arrived in perfect condition.  There is no question where I will go when I need to replenish my supply.  If you need perfectly dried chilis of the highest possible quality, look no farther.  You will NOT be disappointed."
CAN'T GET BETTER THAN SIMPLY ORGANIC,"IF YOU CAN'T GET IT FRESH, SIMPLY ORGANIC IS THE WAY TO GO, GREAT SPICE...."
My favorite morning tea,"This is the best chai tea I have tasted, and since it has 100% of the caffeine of coffee, I usually have 1-2 cups in the morning. Highly recommended"
Coconut Oil,"After reading an article about coconut oil improving memory, I decided to buy it for my husband. After taking it for 2 weeks, he has decided that it has definitely improved his memory. He uses it on his oatmeal in the morning. Check with your doctor before you start using it."
Newman's Own Organics Dog Food,"I switched my mini-Schauzers over to Newman's Own Organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow.  I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was ""breed-specific"" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently ""forgot"" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman's Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the ""breed-specific"" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!<br /><br />And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!  Their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover, they seem more active, more alert, more regular and they actually chew this food (they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing!)  I can't say enough good things about both Newman's Own and Amazon's subscription delivery service!"
Great for summer salads,A great penne pasta that substitutes well for traditional wheat penne in hot or cold recipes.  The price was competitive.  Delivery was fast and breakage minimal - impressive for a large pasta.
Great K-Cup Coffee,"Quick delivery and we really like the bold, rich flavor of Green Mountain Dark Magic. This is the way to order K-Cup coffee."
"Tasty, Maple syrup",Yummy syrup at a great price with auto-ship program.  This is the best price on organic maple syrup I have been able to find in my area.  I appreciate the auto-ship program.  We use this syrup on pancakes and waffles and as sweetener in other items such as ice cream and baked goods.
the dogs ate it so it must be good,"Lets say I, a human has to write this review, and of course I  myself did not eat the dog food, our King Charles Cavalier Spaniels did.<br />Well at first they sniffed and looked at it for a few minutes, and then they ate it, but my dogs do that with some dog foods.<br />so for dog food, it must be pretty good as they (the dogs) seem to eat it.<br />It is a but pricey though."
great healthy crackers!,These are my favorite crackers.  They have a nutty flavor and are very healthy and taste wonderful with absolutely anything spread on them.  My friends and family and I are addicted and will continue to order more and more.
WONDERFUL SEZME SNAPS,"I used to buy the sesame candy and as of lately I haven't been able to find them.  When I found these and purchased them, I was so happy.  These are WONDERFUL!!!"
"So good. So, so good.","Should you buy this: What, are you really thinking about this? BUY. BUY NOW.<br /><br />Pros: Very good chocolate *bar*<br /><br />Cons: ... the female chocoholics didn't leave me much.<br /><br />This is a great bar. It's not a pure chocolate bar, and it's only 55% cocoa content, so if you're a chocolate snob who likes to appreciate the flavor of a nice 100% Colombian dark chocolate bar or a German 85% w/ nibs, you may want to reconsider. I, however, like some variety in my bars, because if I'm going to sit around and eat 3.2 oz of chocolate bar, I'm going to want something else in there. Like some crunchy almonds and dried cherries. OH WAIT, that's this bar! It's a great bar and I loved the 3 that I got to eat. Sadly, the pair of chocoholics who have access to my fridge ensured that 3 of 12 was all I'd get. Completely unfair.<br /><br />If you're still on the fence, consider: at the time of this writing, 2 people have NOT given this a 5 star review. One says they're nothing special and you shouldn't count calories (I'm not), and the other is mad that a 55% bar is too sugary compared to the 85% she's used to. YOU DON'T SAY? Let me tell you, if I bought a 85% bar and it tasted like this, I'd be pretty mad. But it's 55%, which is borderline milk chocolate, and it's sweet, so please don't fault the bar when you like to taste the subtleties of bitter unsweetened chocolate. Which, by the way, if you're a TRUE chocoholic, you should definitely do. A few bites of excellent quality only-chocolate bar is quite the gastronomic experience. But that's not this; this is a chocolate bar you have a few squares of every now and then when you want something sweet, and this delivers. Mmmmmmm."
Processed in a plant where the process peanuts!,I was looking for an alternative for my peanut/walnut allergic son.  Unfortunately these will not work for him.  Processed in a plant where the process peanuts and tree nuts! They are lightly salted and a nice snack.
Authentic,"I lived in Korea for a year, and I've tried ALL the different options available here for spicy ramen.  This is the same as what the street vendors in Korea serve!  However, they add egg to the soup AND put some cheese into the mix.  Add the egg to the soup when it's cooking and mix it in, sprinkle some cheese on the top once you've put in in the bowl.  I also only cook my noodles for 3 mins, they continue to cook in the hot water in the bowl, any longer than that and they are too soggy for me.  The only problem here on Amazon is the price.  I can get a case for literally half the price at any of our Asian food stores here in Denver.  Disappointing, I'd have used the subscribe and save option if it weren't cost prohibitive.  My whole family **loves** these noodles, they are a staple in our house!"
slim jims no good!,"I agree with the person who said it's hard to chew and here is why.<br /><br />Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair?<br /><br />It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess.<br /><br />Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make ""mechanically separated"" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste ""good""? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100!<br /><br />My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog's p..p<br /><br />EEWWW!!!"
Love this sweetener!  Better than Splenda and liquid too!,I found a great substitute for Splenda!  No after taste.  Two drop has the sweetening power of 2 packets of Splenda or Sweet N Low.  It lasts a looooong time too!<br /><br />Definitely worth the $$.
Yum,"Yes, I got the product (all 60, I counted) and none of them were melted! This was a concern for other Lindt chocolates ordered online. This may also be because I ordered it in December. It tastes just as I remembered from eating them in-store.<br /><br />Tip though - it is cheaper ordering them online at 0.31 per candy than in-store, EXCEPT during the holiday season. I went to my local CVS during the Christmas season and got those two 5 ounce packages of Lindt chocolates for 5 dollars, 2.50 each. With 12 candies in each, it comes down to 0.21 for each candy. So stock up during the holidays!"
Murray's pecan cookies,The Murray's pecan shortbread sugar-free cookies are my favorite of sugar-free cookies.  The grocery stores that I frequent didn<br />t seem  to stock these cookies.  The product is excellent.
Too much garlic!,"I was so sad when I opened the first can.  It did not taste well to me or my friends.  We are thinking either the garlic is too much or it is the fire roasted taste.  My friends advised me to send my cans back, I decided to donate them to a food pantry.  Hopefully someone else will like them more than me."
Satisfiying,"I'm not going to argue with those who say this is an outstanding tea. I myself personally reserve that distintion for loose leaf teas.<br /><br />Barrys Irish Breakfast is an excellant satisfiying tea for everyday drinking. I have been averaging 4 to 6 cups a day since I got it. If it were  the only tea I could ever get again, I would be more than happy to drink it. But I think I will order the gold blend next time, as I think the stronger flavor, would be even better."
Excellent!,I order this tea for my husband and he loves it anytime of the day or evening.
Pay Attention To What You Order!,"Only after the second bite did I decide this isn't human food!  Tastes exactly like dry dog food smells.  The plain re-packaging without nutrition info should have been the tip-off.  Nonetheless, I bite into the thing, twice, before I decided that this isn't for me.  They look great and were a hit with the dog owners at my workplace.<br /><br />Amazon, I'd consider quit mixing dog and people food in your ""Grocery"" classification."
My dogs love these,"These are great treats, and my dogs love them, but I don't use them as they are designed.  I usually buy 2 packages and then use each piece as a separate treat (2 sticks, 4 flowers).  My flat-coat has a sensitive stomach and once he starts eating something, he can't (won't) give it up.  By giving him each piece separately, I can monitor how much he gets and it is much better on his digestive system.  They do make a bit of a mess, so I either use them outside or in an area that is easy to clean up the drool that ultimately is left when they are done.  They love them so much!"
Picky dogs,"My Chiuahuah's are picky, and they gobble these treats up. My long haired is a diabetic so these threats are great for him. The packagaing is so nice. and the bonus treats are always a ton. The ""prize"" is always something beautiful."
A much-missed favorite.,"A few years ago, my cats and I relocated to Germany. And while my four-pawed trio generally took the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now, several years later, still sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has never been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not overly picky in their food choices; they willingly accept almost everything appearing in their food bowls. But they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for Pounce is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, what's a poor cat owner to do???"
Yummy,"My husband loves these, so I stuffed his Christmas stocking with them and kept an extra box to spare for when he runs out. The little 2-packs are very convenient for taking to work or anywhere. They are delicious and hold up well to dunking in tea."
great product,"I was amazed at how well these cleaned my dogs teeth. He is not happy with getting his teeth brushed, especially in the back, the Greenies have assisted with cleaning this hard to reach area. I have read other reviews where people have had trouble with their dogs trying to chew off too much and choking or what-ever - my solution stay with your dog as they chew anything this is just plain common sense. I also give it after his evening meal so that he won't try to swallow to big of bites."
yum,"I like these a lot, I've never liked or eaten sweet potatoes in my life so that says a lot. I wish they were organic, or had better ""oils"" in them, but they are at least healthier than potato chips. I like these second best to their sweet potato ones mixed with other vegetable ones."
organic beef jerky,"Our family loves beef jerky, and although the flavor is good, the texture was really tough and difficult to chew."
Very Good,"This is a great tasting coffee. Not only good first thing in the morning, but anytime. Very smooth. Green Mountain puts out great tasting coffee on all flavors and blends"
Nettle Leaf Tea,"If I can't find this at my local market or in a near by store, I order it from Amazon. I drink this tea after a night of drinking alcohol in order to help cleanse my liver."

LOL,this is soooo funny this idiot is making a fortune selling Nespresso capsules<br />for triple the price when you can just call Nespresso or go online to<br />Nespresso.com and buy at 5.70 or 6.40 a pack!! Its really funny that there are people out there that dont do a little research and find this out!!
"smooth, flavorful",I liked the taste if this coffee. It is very smooth and flavorful with no bitterness at all. The one cup serving is also convenient. Do notice though that it is only useful if you have a particular type of one-cup coffee machine
Great candy,This candy is really great.  Everybody that I have given it to also loves it.  The soft centers and coffee flavor are a winning combination.
So delicious,"This tastes so delicious. It's about the size and texture of a Larabar--maybe a little bit bigger. Especially if you enjoy other PROBAR bars, you will like this taste and blend of goodies. There are big chocolate chunks in it and marshmallow patches, too. I just wish the ingredients were all organic and that the marshmallows did not contain ""soy protein"" (AKA hexane-rinsed soy protein concentrate/isolate). However, it is really, really good."
Delicious item,I tried the Goose Pate. This was my first time trying pate and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I tried it with Wheat Thin crackers and it was very tasty. The pate was smooth and creamy with a nice subtle flavor. I definitely will try new flavors.
Good but salty,They are good but they are a little to salty for my tastes. The kind of salty that makes your tongue feel weird after eating a cup or so.
actual product weight: 1lb 4oz,Shipping weight is listed as 6 pounds. Actual weight of product: 1 pound 4 ounces.<br /><br />It's probably obvious to someone who knows what size a #10 can (e.g. not someone not me) is that the weight of the product would not be six pounds.
"OK coffee, but there are better alternatives","I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K"">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI"">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find ""burnt"", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G"">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars."
We won't be making the Switch,"We're not soda drinkers in our household, an occasional sprite maybe but otherwise I like to mix club soda with fruit juice when I'm in the mood for something bubbly. This sounded intriguing since it's toted as being all natural.<br /><br />I expected a much less sweet flavor, not that it was bad just that it was VERY VERY sweet and candy like. I'm also shocked by the high calories, granted juice in general is high calorie but I was still surprised. My husband really liked the taste and even considered it refreshing so your opinion will likely vary pending what you're accustomed to. Not something I would give my 5yr old or reach for again myself."
Best K cup coffee,best tasting K cup you can get if you like a strong cup of Joe. To bad it looks to be on the out
Great tea!!,"This tea is amazing -- and affordable!!! Licorice tea is one of the most amazing teas. I am definitely a tea drinker and if this comes from mouth, you can be sure that this is a great tea. I also like the fact that it's quite cheap. There're a few other brands which are a bit more expensive and I think are not as good. I recommend this tea to everyone."
great sugar skull,My son used this sugar skull for a school project on different Halloween traditions.  Everyone loved it!
"OK, but not as good as Celestial Seasonings version (not available)","Bought this when I could no longer get (the wonderful) Celestial Seasonings Cool Brew (mint + green tea).<br /><br />This is an acceptable alternative, but I do prefer the CS version.<br /><br />I sweeten this with stevia; do be careful when doing so, as too much stevia makes this tea taste like you're drinking diluted toothpaste."
These contain a fair amount of SOY...if you have a sensitivity...,"Popchips Original Potato Chips are dee-lish.  But BEWARE of the SOY in them if you have a soy sensitivity, like I do.  I ate quite a few and had a bad reaction before reading the label and realizing that soy was an ingredient.  I just never imagined soy would be in a potato chip!  I learned my lesson!  My kids love the chips and, I agree, they are YUMMY!  I'm sad that I can't have them!  :-("
Rice is a disaster,"This product is completely ridiculous. Just a year or two ago, they used to sell it in boxes which contained only chicken tikka masala, and no rice. Now, they've cut the portion of CTM in half, and replaced it with some cheap bland rice. The price of the entire package has NOT gone down, though. So now I get half as much CTM for the same exact price.<br />I emailed the company to complain, and they claim that many people were demanding the rice. I assume this is a lie, because I buy this product for the chicken tikka masala, not for rice. I can easily make my own rice very easily and quickly. I think they did it to cut costs and rip people off.<br />The CTM in the package is delicious, but unfortunately I am not going to buy it when I have to pay full price for such a small amount. Now I have to heat up two of them to get the same amount I had before, and who knows if even that is the same amount.<br />I found one store in Queens that has the old stuff (no rice), but I'm afraid they're going to run out and not replace it.<br />I do not want the rice in this thing, the portion of CTM is much too small. I urge everyone to not buy this product, wait until the old style becomes available again:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Tandoor-Chef-Chicken-Masala-10-Ounce/dp/B002GOYT1O/ref=pd_sim_gro_3"
tasty steak nuggets,"These are pretty good, but a little overpriced - I would only buy if there was a promotion. Some pieces are deliciously tender and seasoned perfectly, but there usually are more that are too dried out and tough, or overseasoned."
the best....,As always Jacobs coffee delivers on aroma and taste..No american coffee compares. My favorite coffee. You will enjoy this flavorful coffee.
An indulgence with a bite,"Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.<br />But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat<br />very many. That makes them an indulgence that<br />rescues some people from overindulgence."
better than the rest,I really liked the peppered flavor of the beef steaks.........i have yet to try them all but i hear peppered is the best flavor. spicey as far as pepper goes and tender. somethings you cant find in stores so i like shopping with amazon there great too.
Once in a while special treat,"My 9 month old 45 lb pit bull is an avid chewer who has and will eat just about anything he can find, including my hard wood floors.. while picking up bird food I grabbed one of these relieved that at least when he devoured it he wasn't eating chunks of plastic and hence wouldn't get mad when I had to take it away and throw it in the trash.  I came home, read a magazine, he sat quietly on the sofa beside me happily chewing and by the time I had finished my magazine he had finished his bone.  While certainly not a long lasting chew it is something I'd pick up again when I get bird food since I know he enjoys it.  I used to buy the stuffed regular bones but then I'd end up with him wanting to play fetch with the empty bone and would end up throwing it away so at least I know this isn't something that months later i'm stepping on getting out of bed."
easy and good,I made a cheese filled manicotti that turned out nicely.  Be sure to have enough liquid in the sauce to keep it from being dry.
Wonderful stuff,Great rice.  It's too bad I can't find it in stores any more.  So glad that Amazon carries it.  Almost time to stock up again!
Wanted an alternative protein source,"I use other protein sources like whey, plant based protein and seed based protein.  I was looking for something that I could put into a smoothie that would provide another good protein source.  This gelatin product doesn't add any flavor to the smoothies I make and seems to thicken the consistency.  I recommend the product."
If you like generic brown sauce,"you'll love Nong Shim Chapagetti Chajang Noodle, because this is all you should expect. Anything beyond that be prepared to add all manner of additional seasonings and accompaniments.<br />Extremely bland and unforgettable, as another reviewer indicated it resembles chocolate, so if you want ramen with mole sauce go for it otherwise you should expect more of a kick from Campbell's Noodle soup."
Just who does not like oreos,"nom nom nom. Oreos are just delicious at every age. Eating these just brings back so many fond memories of my childhood. They make a good snacking food in the afternoon or even in the morning. Just be warned, these things are filled with sugar. Each pack has 6 oreos, which I tihnk is too much for one serving. I usually split one pack for two days."
great low salt seasoning,The flavor of this product is great. It is not HOT as one might assume cajun products are.  Thanks for a great product.
New formula nothing like old!,"We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.  Wish I could give ZERO stars."
"Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter","I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else."
Excellant Coffee,This coffee is delicious but very strong. Not for the faint of heart...it will wake you up!!!It has a wonderfully rich aroma while brewing and a deep yet not bitter taste. This is a great deal for K-cups and supports an environmentally friendly company. I would wholehearted recommend.
Great taste,This is one of my fav flavors so far. Do not let the word CREAM fool you. There is very little cream to these but they are still very flavorfull. I add either French Vanilla powdered cream or liquid cream to this and it's great.<br />I have it on a regular basis. The flavor does not get old or eventually give you an aftertaste.
"Surprisingly good, if you brew it right","A surprisingly good green tea.  I usually drink loose leaf green tea, but when I need the convenience of a teabag this stuff is tasty -- and a steal.<br /><br />Different green teas required quite different soaking conditions.  For this tea:<br />1. You've got to make sure the water is cool enough.  I pour boiled water into one mug, let it sit for a few moments to cool a bit, then pour the water into a second mug, and then put the tea bag in.<br />2. Don't soak it for more than 2 minutes.  It becomes noticeably bitter if you do."
96=45,Just because you see 96 treats on the box your crazy if you think that's how many your buying everyone knows 96 really means 45
Best!,"These are the BEST chips ever!  I hate chips that are ruined by mass quantities of salt.  These chips actually taste like...wait for it...POTATO!  The only thing wrong with them is that they are so good I can't stop eating them!  Light, crisp, not greasy, and tasty.  Could it get any better?"
BEST DOG FOOD EVER!!!!,"BY FAR THE BEST FOOD OUT THERE!!!!  I HAD MY 2 PITBULL PUPPIES ON BLUE BUFFALO, NOT A BAD DOG FOOD, BUT IT GAVE BOTH MY DOGS MAYOR GAS.  IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIND ORIJEN AT ANY OF MY LOCAL AND MAYOR PET STORES.  IT TOOK A PETCO EMPLOYEE TO TELL ME THAT A SMALL SHOP IN RIVERSIDE CA CALLED ELLIOT'S HAD IT.  I DROVE OVER THERE AND SURE ENOUGH THEY HAD IT SO I BOUGHT THE 15LB PUPPY BAG, AND I STARTED TO TRANSITION THEM AND BY THE 2ND WEEK ON THE FOOD THE GAS WENT AWAY.  I THOUGHT THAT MY PUPPIES COATS LOOKED GOOD WHEN I HAD THEM ON BLUE BUFFALO, BUT WITH ORIJEN THEIR COATS ARE UNBELIVABLE.  TILL THIS DAY MY PUPPIES DO NOT PASS ANY GAS AND IT ALSO SEEMED TO CONTROL HOW MANY TIMES THEY POOP.  SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE FOOD IS EXPENSIVE, BUT I THINK IF YOU LOVE YOUR DOGS LIKE YOUR KIDS OR FAMILY YOU WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT IT TWICE.  I THINK THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT, BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />ERIC PITBULL LOVER"
Best coffee!,"After many years of searching for good italian coffee without that bitter after taste, here comes lavazza. Italy's no.1 coffee and an exceptional coffee worldwide. I use it in my drip coffee machine as well as my Italian espresso.<br />Love it!<br />Very happy that Amazon have it at a great price, thanks Amazon!"
Orange?,"This is an OK tasting dark chacolate, however I was not able to either taste or smell any orange. It would benefit from a touch more stevia and some orange rind."
great product,"I like to add this to curries.  Creamed coconut contains both the coconut fiber and the fat, unlike coconut milk which has no fiber.  It has a pleasant grainy texture, but once dissolved, is not very noticeable.  It's slightly sweet and has a good coconut flavor.  Google ""creamed coconut"" recipes for some good ideas."
Moth trap,"This product does not work.  We know we have a clothing moth problem.  We frequently kill the flying adults and vacuum the rugs, carpets, and other areas where the eggs are laid, but they are still not completely eradicated.  However, NONE of the traps ever contained anything."
I love coarse salt,"I have two ceramic grinders, one for the usual pepper, the other for coarse salt.  I am never happy these days with regular salt and pepper shakers.  Once you grind coarse salt you are hooked.  This salt is good."
My all-'round favorite stir fry sauce ...,"I love stir fries!  It's easy to put together a meal for one in a hurry, and you know what you're getting.  I discovered the House of Tsang stir fry sauces several years ago, and got hooked on them.  Then I moved, and the local stores around here don't carry this brand.<br /><br />So, I was *thrilled* to find it here on Amazon.  I've been using some other brands, but they just don't have the depth of flavor I get from House of Tsang.  The other brands are more expensive, too: up to $8.00/bottle at the store.<br /><br />This is a basic stir-fry sauce: not spicy, but with that slightly sweet / soy sauce / nutty sesame flavor, with hints of ginger and garlic.  I've used it so far with beef, chicken, shrimp, and pork, and it works well with all of those.  I usually use either frozen stir-fry veggies, or get a ""stir fry mix"" from the fresh produce aisle.  My tools of choice are a small flat-bottom wok on an induction burner.  In about 10 minutes, I have a meal.<br /><br />Good stuff, this."
So good and healthy,These taste like frosted mini wheat cereal but are not as crazy sweet.  I also love that it's healthy!
Mussini Balsamic Glaze,"Delicious drizzled with olive oil on veggies & salads. Nice syrupy flow. Ingredients listed are: cooked grape must, 39% Balsamic vinegar of Modena (wine vinegar, cooked grape must), sugar, modified starch. Like that there are few ingredients, with grape must and Balsamic vinegar of Modeda (39%-would higher be better?) being the top 2."
Mehhhh...,"I was excited to try these honey drops, who doesn't want more energy?!  I definitely could use it at this time of year (the holidays).  The taste is pleasant enough.  It reminded me of a Japanese candy I remember eating when I was a kid.  Anyway, I never got that burst of energy I was hoping for.  The ingredients say that there are B6, B12, and C vitamins in the candy, but personally, I didn't notice any difference between this and any other candy.  If you love honey candy, then go for it.  But don't count on it to give you that burst of energy to get your holiday shopping list done!"
Tastes like medicine,"As soon as I took my first sip, I regretted my purchase. It has a slightly medicinal flavor, which lingers as an aftertaste. Other than that there is no real flavor to it. The label claims it provides mental performance. It contains caffeine, so that may be true. But many other beverages, better tasting and less expensive, also contain caffeine. As fizzy vitamin water goes, this is very disappointing."
"Not for strong chewers, part II","My 5 lb. Pomeranian was able to chew off the large knobby end of the bone, and then managed to chew off a a smaller 1"" knuckle-shaped piece from somewhere (by this time I had already taken the larger knob end away from him), getting it stuck in his throat.  Luckily, he threw it up while we were rushing to the vet.  Even small/toy dogs who are big chewers should not be given this product."
Tastes like the real thing!,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK63LK"">Tinkyada Brown Rice Penne Pasta with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>Tinkyada makes pasta that actually tastes like pasta. I have tried many different brands and nobody comes close to Tinkyada. If you are allegeric to wheat you can have great tasting pasta again."
Easy for a single lifestyle,These potatoes are pretty good. They can be eaten alone or served with a meal. Really like potatoes and this is an easy choice.
Tasty addition to any dish,These fire roasted tomatoes are delicious when added to any stew or soup or even over chicken.  They are not too spicy for me and just give that extra zing of flavor that perks up your tastebuds.
Delicious,These were just delicious. Took the bag to work and nobody could tell they were sugar free. Would buy more if shipping weren't so expensive. Wish I could find them for sale locally.
expresso coffee,We have been using this for almost a year now and having a subscription order really makes the coffee a good buy besides having such a great expresso taste.
Happy Hips Duck Breast is a great treat,"After finding these at Target, I bought some for my dogs.  They absolutely love them!  At $6.79 per bag, though, they were really expensive.  I tried to find them cheaper and have succeeded.  Even though there is no 'free shipping', the price makes up for it if you buy a bunch of them.  I bought 10 bags and came out better than if I had bought them at Target."
Mini's,"These are great for a candy dispenser I have at work.  Some of the other versions of M&M's are too large to process through the machine without breaking them into pieces.  On the flip side, current pricing on Amazon seem to be almost double what you can get them for in the store.  Walmart sells these for $2.98 a bag...you do the math."
The best soup ever,"Its the best soup ever, so tasty and so easy and it feels like a fresh soup.  Great for to keep at work and travel.  Very healthy, I like to add frozen vegetable to the soup itself."
Not too good !,"I bought Twinings Earl Grey Tea, 12 count  K-Cups. Always liked that brand. Nice smooth tea. Somehow, it's lost it's flavor in the K-cup. Kind of has a lemony or some altered taste. I wouldn't buy this particular one again."
My Dog Is Happy,My 19 month old Shihtzu/Bichon didn't care about ANY treats until I tried PureBites. Now I feel I can train her better because I have a reward she loves and it is good for her!
never gets old!,We ordered this for our annual movie-a-thon we have in our driveway on Halloween... still as funny as it was way back when.
Great Salt - difficult to grind,"This salt is great and way cheaper than any of the local spice shops. It does seem more difficult to grind than other himilayan salts I have tried, but doing a little at a time makes it well worth it. Would i buy it again?? YES"
So Salty!,Really inedible. So salty and just tastes awful. Disappointed to find it was ineligible for return...now they're very expensive dog treats.
"Tasty, filling, but only four servings per box.","I am not on a gluten free diet. However, I find gluten free foods more filling. And so, I gave these crackers a try, after coming across them in my grocery store. I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic. Also, they do contain eggs."
Cat's love these things,"These are the only treats my wife's cats eats.  Give them anything else the dogs end up eating them.  Its funny because they like them so much they have learned to beg for them.  You can't lose with these treats, your cat will love them."
delicious!,"i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best.  now, i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product."
coffee,I love this coffee. I love getting a value on it. I use it everyday in my Keurig coffee maker. Thanks for a great product.
YUCK!,"I've been eating tamarind and tamarind paste since I was 3 years old, I ordered this product and was really excited to taste it. My tamarind paste came in the mail today, and once I put it in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. Honestly this is the worst tamarind paste I had ever tasted in my life :("
these are surely kitty crack!,"i was surprised at how much my little marlee loves these snacks ... a real winner!  these treats are definitely on the soft/moist side which is what i need for a kitty who doesn't drink water.  even though they are small, i will cut each one in half to use as small training treats.  i'll definitely be buying more of these."
"Great coffee, but don't buy it online.","I have always loved Illy, and bought two cans at Christmas for delivery with a bunch of other Amazon orders.  I did it purely for the convenience of not having to pick up coffee to take to my holiday destination.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed:  one of the cans had a broken vacuum seal (all Illy cans are vacuum sealed).  Ergo, the coffee was not fresh; and since I couldn't be sure how non-fresh, I tossed it.  The other can was fine.<br /><br />I imagine Amazon would have honored a return, but it's not worth the time on a simple can of coffee.<br /><br />So I must reluctantly recommend you do not buy this product online, since there seem to be quality-control issues and returning to the vendor in that context is a net loss.<br /><br />The coffee itself, though, is very excellent, and I've been a loyal Illy customer for over 10 years.  This is the first vacuum-seal issue I've ever encountered."
"We examined their claims, gave it a taste-test, & found multiple problems with Zevia...But here's a solution! (Read on)","First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.<br /><br />Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.<br /><br />So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!<br /><br />At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!<br /><br />We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.<br /><br />First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their ""all natural"" claim a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).<br /><br />Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.<br /><br />SOLUTION!!<br /><br />Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.<br /><br />Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).<br /><br />For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that ""bite"" that makes a cola taste like a cola!<br /><br />Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!<br /><br />Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).<br /><br />(2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.<br /><br />And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!"
decaf,Not a big fan of decaf but this is better than most - guests seem to like it a lot.
Great for... Everything,"A sure fire cure for when I have an upset stomach. And definitely helps with my GERD symptoms (acid reflux). It just always makes me feel better, that's the best I can say about it. Try it after a heavy meal."
"I love the product - that's why 5 stars, but not the price fluctuations","When it comes to the cereal itself I love the product and agree with others that this is the best tasting cereal on the marker, however I also agree with others that the price fluctuations are annoying. I too had to cancel my subscription when the price skyrocket and it was no longer cheaper than what the local store is offering. Now that the price is more reasonable, even though still more $ than what I paid the first time, and it's a 3-pack not a 4-pack, I will buy it again. Lesson learned, next time the price goes down I will buy multiple order."
BUGS!!!,Bought this product from our local Publix where it's often buy 1 get 1 free.<br />We ate it a couple of times and I must saw we did like the taste.<br /><br />One day I tore open the packaging when my son started crying. I went to him and left the packaging on the counter. I came back a minute later and my countertop was crawling with tiny little bugs that could have been mistaken for spices if they weren't moving! I emptied the back in a zip-loc and it was full of these little bugs crawling around. If I would of put the packaging directly in the water i'm sure the bugs would have died instantly in the water.<br /><br />I was completely disgusted and called the company. The woman on the line was completely unfazed saying it seemed that my product was contaminated and that these things happen! Happen to who?!!<br />She continued to say she could send me free boxes or some coupons if I would provide my address.<br />I informed her that the last thing I want is an other box of this stuff in my house and hung up.<br />DO NOT BUY!
I love these Dutch Mints,"I grew up in Hudsonville, Michigan, about 20 minutes from Holland, Michigan, where there was a very large Dutch community. When I moved out to Oregon, I could not find these mints anywhere and I wanted them so I was very glad when I could finally find them on Amazon.<br /><br />They are more of a mild type of mint, especially compared to the peppermints that Lifesavers puts out. I suppose that I would not suggest them to anyone that doesn't care for a mint flavor. But, if you do like a mint flavor and you find some of the mints in the US too strong for you, then try these out."
"Please Sir, I want some more.","It is really hard to find a good gluten free bread that doesn't taste like cardboard. My search came to an end. I can finally enjoy sandwiches, french bread or hot chocolate and toast!"
Terrific Product!,"I sprinkle a pack of this over my greek yogurt in the morning for breakfast! It makes a satisfying, filling and nutritious meal. (and fast)"
Popcorn lover,"Bought this popcorn along with the Elite Popcorn maker.  Great taste, I like the fact that it has three separate pouches so you can vary the seasoning (I like mine salty so I use it all).  Can't be any easier to use, no measuring, popcorn & oil stay fresh because they are sealed.<br /><br />Came back to add my review and got some great tips.  Such as actually heating the oil first instead of dumping it all in at once.  Also liked the tips of adding the oil before turning on the popper (always worried about melting plastic or burning my hand) and pouring the popcorn/seasoning into a scoop to add to the popper.  Thanks to those who took the time to post the tips!"
"Great product -- reduced my dogs ""emissions""","These treats truly are as pure as you can get -- 100% beef liver and nothing else.  This also means that they're grain free, which is fantastic for dogs with gas problems.  Switching from other (high-quality) treats to PureBites liver reduced the frequency and potency of my dog's rear-end emissions by about 90 percent.  Both my dogs love these treats.  The only, minor drawback is that the bottom of the bag tends to have a little pile of tiny bits and pieces of treats -- at that point, I'll pour out a little pile for each of my dogs and they lick them up like candy."
Excellent!,"What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil."
Perfect treats for cats with urinary issues,"These treats were recommended by my vet for a cat with both struvite and calcium oxalate crystals.  She is on a very strict diet and any variations causes her immense pain.  These treats don't aggravate her urinary problems, and she loves them.  My vet quit carrying them, and the price through Amazon is better.  I highly recommend these treats whether your cat has urinary problems or not."
Contains Trans-Fats,"Can't tell you how this tastes, because I read the ingredients first, but it has trans-fats in every flavor. :( The seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. I wouldn't have purchased this otherwise."
Those Red Hot Blues are one bad mutha...,"You watch your mouth!<br /><br />Simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch.<br /><br />I won't waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead. Just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper (the special ingredient that distinguishes Red Hot Blues from the standard Blue Chips). Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!)."
Great Product,"Wasn't sure how easy this product would be to locate, was so happy to find it at Amazon. This is a delicious product great for smoothies or sandwiches, the taste is amazingly smooth and peanutty great texture. I would highly recommend it for people like myself that is watching their calories and salt and sugar intake. Amazon is an excellent resource for hard to find products and their service is outstanding."
Amazing!,I have to say this stuff is truly amazing. I figured this was just another conditioner and I have used them all. Not so. We had recently been to the Blue Lagoon in Iceland. The ends of my color treated hair were like straw ever since. The minerals in the water just sucked right into my hair and it was nasty. For the last week I had been using all kinds of conditioners to try to get this resolved. Last night I used this product that came yesterday and VOILA! My hair is soft again and the ends are healed. I would not have believed it if it hadn't happened to me.<br />The container opens from the bottom which is nice because you don't have to wait for the conditioner to run down. My only caution to you is make sure you have it snapped shut tightly otherwise it leaks out.
Makes the best roast EVER!,"The Crockery Gourmet for beef is so easy to use and gives the roast the most wonderful flavor and tenderness. I always cook my roast longer than the package states. (I put the roast and Crockery Gourmet in the crockpot the night before and let it cook all night WITHOUT the vegetables. The next morning I turn the roast over and add baby carrots and onions and let it cook together until dinner. The gravy it makes is thin, but so tasty on rice or mashed potatoes, and the roast is sooooo tender."
Loved it!!!,I bought this as a gift for a friend and he LOVED it!!! I struggled with trying to find the right tree to order because I was  worried that the tree would be to small.  I ended up ordering this tree and I am glad I did because he loves it and it is a perfect size!!
Misleading Flavor Name,"As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a ""Creme Caramel"" taste, or something similar, and I don't feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn't do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee."
Yummm Sweet Potatoes,"My 5 month old LOVES these mixtures. Great job ELLAS I promised I would never feed him something that I wouldn't eat myself. They ALL taste good. I would eat any of them if I was so inclined to eat a pureed meal. They are easy to pack & throw in the diaper back/suit case for travel. I had no worry about them leaking (like a small plastic tupperware). The price is right, shipping was quick, and they store really well in the pantry in the ready made box. Happy Baby = Happy Mommy"
Convient!,"I have been using this for over a year now. It is so much more convenient than using UHT and in my opinion, it's the closest you will get to the taste of real skimmed milk from a powder."
Honey Stingers....the perfect natural energy,"These are the most awesome little energy snack possible!  Brought a box of these on a hunt for a week with some buddies for the first time...along with a box of Sharkies. Prior to this, Sharkies where our mainstay when needing a boost and energy replacement.  Have to say, even the Sharkies fan in the group had to admit Honey Stingers fairly surpassed Sharkies in both taste and performance.  Will still probably bring both next time for variety, but definitely twice as many Honey Stingers.  Honey IS the perfect food!"
My baby's favorite,"My 9 month old gobbles this up.  We've tried Earth's Best which she didn't like and Gerber which she didn't mind, but she absolutely loves this oatmeal cereal.  She eats it more than she eats any other ""solid"". She's been eating it for 3 months now."
Our favorite coffee,This is our favorite coffee! It is very rich and it is so convenient that it is already ground. I love mine halved with skim milk but my husband likes it black. We go through about a bag every 1.5 weeks. Beware though!  Visitors often find this coffee way too strong.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the price is so high here. My local supermarket and W****** carry this for half the price posted here. I would love if Amazon had a subscribe and save option with more reasonable prices.
SALTY Anchovies,"I got these anchovies as a gift for my anchovy-loving boyfriend. While he liked them well enough, they were just too salty to be able to even consider getting through the entire can, even over months. We soaked them in water prior to consumption and that helped, but on the whole I think they would have been more enjoyable with about 1/16th of the salt."
Edaname,"A great price for a wonderful product.  I use these as a snack, in my salads and anywhere salted nuts are called for.  They are healthy and supplement my fiber as required by my doctor."
Best Soda EVER!,"I am not a huge fan of soda normally, but this stuff is amazing.  This was also my firs soda with real can sugar, man what a difference that makes in the taste.  I can't get enough of this.  I will be trying other Hansen's products now!  I highly recommend this flavor (Cherry Vanilla Creme) to everyone."
Ultimate crunch for your foods,"This product will give you the crispiest chicken, fries, onion rings and the most delicious country fried steak. The flakes are made of rice and have a much heavier texture than just plain breadcrumbs, so it sticks better to food and gets 10 times crispier. You use it the same way you'd use regular breadcrumbs.  Because it has so much more volume than regular breadcrumbs, you can also use it as a topping for casseroles.  It's also the perfect filler to add when preparing a meatloaf. It's the only breadcrumbs I use!!"
Awesome sugar free soda!,I have never really been a soda fan ever. Growing up as a kid the only soda I thought tasted good was root beer. As an adult and a vegan I know very well that regular sodas are just empty calories and a whole bunch of high fructose corn syrup so I have stayed far far away from them.<br /> I use stevia for my coffee in the morning and I love it. I have done the research on all artificial sweeteners and I wont go near those chemicals. Amazon had recommended this to me by other things i have purchased. I was too nervous to buy 24 of them since i don't like soda and it could have tasted terrible. So my solution was to get a 6 pack at my local store.<br /><br />All i have to say is WOW! It has a great root beer taste. I am so pleased with this product I plan on keeping this an auto-ship. I recommend this to people who want yummy soda without the soda and future cancer.
cookies,These are special butter crisps and taste as close to home-made as boxed cookies can taste
A real finger saver-literally!,"Having to shove pills down the throat of our aging mastif/greyhound mix was murder on my fingers.  I had bruises and semi-permanant teeth marks on both index fingers!  Pill Pockets are like the proverbial ""spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down"".  The fact that they come in 2 sizes is an added bonus."
Wonderful Drink,"I really love this beverage. I have been drinking it for years. I started out on the ""Java"" flavor to have a coffee replacement. The thing is, when we are replacing something we can be dissappointed if the new item isn't exactly like like the original. And that's the problemn. There isn't anything that is going to be exactly like coffee except coffee. So between the similar to coffee tasting Java teeccino and changing my frame of mind about no longer trying to make coffee without coffee, I had very good success. Let the new beverage be what it is. In this case Teeccino. So as far as Teeccino goes, I find it delicious. The Java does taste more like coffee than the others. However the vanilla and the mocha both are wonderful tasting. If you get into the Maya blends, they taste a lot like coffee too, but I felt sleepy drinking them. Could have been the Tryptophan or just a sleepy couple of days in my life, haha. At either rate, Teeccino has been a godsend for me. I love them and appreciate having a hot beverage (that isn't tea) that is good for me. Just a reminder, if you are going into this trying to make coffee then buy the Java, and try to remember that it isn't coffee. Otherwise enjoy a good healthy beverage. To me they really do have a wonderful flavor. Remember, the only place you will find coffee is in coffee. Which by the way, I don't even like coffee anymore. I was a coffee junky, from the moment I woke until bed. Meaning there was a cup of coffee on my bedside table. So for me to enjoy another product more than coffee and to not even care to have coffee, is a big deal. Enjoy."
Not a patch on the sojos grain free add meat!,"Sadly for me and the time i spend cooking ground turkey for my little darlings, they really didn't like the Sojos complete food. They love the add meat variety (LOVE LOVE LOVE) but this- they ate when they were starving, but otherwise ignored. I wish they loved it it would be so much easier! They are little yorkies - perhaps it's a breed thing."
Noticable Weight Gain in My Dog After Only 6 Days of Feeding Her This,"My dog was looking a bit on the thin side, and after ruling out any health issues, the vet suggested that I make changes to her diet. I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight. I never thought a dog could gain weight like that in less than a week, but my dog really bulked up and does not look thin at all anymore. It's amazing."
I'm addicted,"Right flavor arrived and our whole family LOVED it, including kids.  We prefer this one so much more than the lemon.  I had to change my subscription to once/month instead of every three months.  Both the chocolate and the tart raspberry flavors are present, but it is not sickeningly sweet like most bars.  It's a great snack to throw in the lunch box or to take along in the car when you feel munchy."
"Delicious, but Pricey when buying through Amazon","Love the decaf instant, especially the organic blend.  One big however -- I purchased it @ wholefoods for 1/2 the price .... cheaper @ vitacost.com."
Great for my hair,"This is the second Clear product I tried recently. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIK"">Like the one before it</a>, my hair really feels stronger, and I no longer have a dandruff problem. (I went through many different brands, including specialty ones, but this one is the best so far).<br /><br />In addition to the basic dandruff shampoo ingredient (Pyrithione Zinc), it contains several natural oil and tea extracts, which actually seem to work for my hair. Do not get it wrong, there are a lot of generic brand shampoos that has pyrithione zinc in them at shelves for $3, but the other stuff that comes with it makes them ineffective for me.<br /><br />While this is more expensive than other brands (and the case is smaller, only 13oz), it still is worth the extra cost. If you have a dandruff problem, or feel like your scalp is dying due to your shampoo, I would recommend trying this at least one."
Three Delicious Tastes All Mixed Together,"Popcorn, chocolate and caramel - what could be a better combination?  The snack packs are only 130 calories each and 24g of carbs (which makes it within the snack guidelines for diabetics of 15 to 30 carbs).  Sometimes popcorn has a lot of hulls, but they used sufficiently good quality popcorn here to avoid that.<br />These are very yummy, but at only 1.06 oz. each, there isn't much in each package.  I could have easily eaten 2 or 3 packages, but that would have upped my calories and carbs, so I stopped at one.  If you are really hungry one pack is not going to curb your hunger.  Anyone who likes sweetened popcorn will love these.  This is a winner."
"Very tasty snack, from the peanut experts","This is a very tasty snack from the peanut experts-- planters.  Only 220 calories per bar and loaded with protean.  They taste very good, I will buy again."
My husband and kids cannot get enough of these cookies!,"I was a little skeptical at first since they are gluten free and all, but it turned out much better than expected.  My husband could not even tell that it was a gluten free cookie that he was eating.  When I made it the second time, I did add more chocolate chips in it, and they love them even more."
Too bitter,"I hardly order chai teai, then I tried Tazo chai tea, due to the nice reviews on Stash brand  and cheaper price I went for it.  Way too bitter in comparison to Tazo, I used  almost 10 ounces of water and I wasn't able to finish my cup.  It is very bitter!!! Be aware, and only buy it  if you like real real strong black tea.  As a matter of fact is more like black tea than  chai.<br /><br />Keep in mind I am not a tea expert, but if I like a nice cup of tea, and never have not finished one, like in this case."
Horrible,"This product was the worst - it was so stale, even the dog didn't eat it (and she eats everything). It had such a stale taste to it I thought for sure the product was years old but there was no expiration date on it. None the less - it went in the garbage."
"Great Idea, but it is not very good.","I like the taste of coke and pepsi, if I had to choose between both of them I would choose Pepsi.  The soda stream cola is awful.  I can normally drink any soda, but this one is almost undrinkable.  I gave it two stars because it is better for the environment."
Old Merchandise,"My dogs love these treats and buying them online was much cheaper than retail. However, both bags that I ordered had dry, crumbly treats inside."
Loves it!,"Wow, my daughter LOVES these! She is about 10 months and this thing disappeared in one sitting. The pouch allows babies to feed themselves by using the opening as a straw. She would take a slurp, pause, and say, ""YUMMM!"" It's not always easy to have organic vegetables and fruits always at the ready, and I think that these are a great way to fit them in when you can't make all your baby's food yourself. Plus, they taste great!"
Great product,"Great buy, excellent quality. Love the big size. Keep it right next to the stove. I look forward to ordering again soon."
"Weird, but passable","How could anyone truly substitute peanut butter? You're right. They can't! However, this stuff has a whipped texture comparable to cake frosting and is palatable when used on low-calorie brownies and such. Also, PB2, a powdered peanut butter can be added to this to give it a more realistic flavor with only 45 calories per serving. I'm on a calorie-restricted meal plan and use it just how I suggested you should above."
Received 10 year old Olive Oil,Just received 2 bottle set and noticed the olive oil was bottled in 2000 - their website says olive oil can stay fresh for 2 years after bottling.  hmmmm...
Excellent!,"This is an excellent product.  I tried a handful that a friend had and I was hooked!  It has good flavor without being too salty.  You can also chop them and add to salads or in green beans.  My kids enjoy them also, good alternative to junk snacks!"
Lefse,"Mrs Olson's Lefse is an excellent product.  Lefse is a traditional food item in my family, but as times become more hectic, it is an items that gets more and more difficult to make at home.  This product is excellent.  As close to homemade as I have found.  The company shipped it fast and fresh.  I do recommend this product to all who have and/or have not tried lefse.  It is just darn good eat'n!"
Sweet Chili Sauce,"I'm a big fan of the sweet chili sauce for rice and other asian food products as a condiment or dipping sauce.  I was looking for another brand ""Thai Chili Sauce"", but it's harder and harder to find in large capacity containers.  I bought this as a subsitute, and I really enjoy it.  It comes in large qauanty containers,  I can only find of my other favorit Thai Chili Sauce in small 2.5 ounce expensive containers.  This comes as a full two liters of sauce, so this will last me at least three months, and it's cheaper in large qantities.  I will buy this brand again."
It's just granola when it comes down to it,"The product here is called ""cinnamon oat clusters"", but in reality it's just granola in a bit of a fancy form. According to the ingrediants list, it's not only oats but also rice, buckwheat, and some other stuff, plus flax seed. It also uses cane juice and molassesm as sweeteners, with no artificial crap (though does have added vitemin e).<br /><br />So it's pretty healthy, reletively speaking. Still, it's food and taste is what matters -- and on that note it's pretty average. It's a nice mix of sweet and oaty, and I admit I wouldn't have trouble eating it as a long term minching snack. At the same time, though, nothing about it particularly stands out. Combined with the fact that it costs over 50 cents an oz, pretty high for a simple snack food, it's not something I could recommend unless you're a complete health nut."
great,ty. it was great. took to last day to get to me but loved the candies. I would order again next year.
Natural Gout Medicine,"Read about using Black Cherry concentrate to treat the symptoms of gout. I tried this for about a week, taking a couple of teaspoons worth each morning and evening. After about a week the gout cleared up. It seems to have worked. The product is very strong tasting, but that is to be expected of a syrup like concentrate. The price is better than what I could find elsewhere."
Liquid Stevia with lemon flavoring,I really love this stuff - and it's healthy. Its all natural stevia sweetner with a lemon flavoring. I love it in my team in the morning and the only local supplier went out of business.
Tortuga Rum Cake,I had purchased some of these while in the Bahamas. They are just as yummy coming from Amazon as from the source!
RUBY RED,"I am so so so so upset that I cannot find this item!!! Ruby Red is the BESTEST flavor of all the Kraft Crystal light products. I have been searching forever for this and when I find any at all, I buy them all up. I have a lower carbohydrate intake and drink all crystal light....I dont even use the store brand......BUT since every time that I find a flavor I love it goes away I will be searching for other brands......One time I found Ocean Spray have the RUby Red grapefruit in singles and I loved it but now no one carries it.....BRING BACK THE RUBY!!!!!"
not worth the calories,"These cookies are dry and not very flavorful.  While it can be nice to have a quick and easy vegan snack, at over 400 calories each, I can find better alternatives!"
Not bad using CoffeeMate Chocolate Creamer,"Not bad at all when I use CoffeeMate CHOCOLATE creamer.<br />I still like swiss mix made with 2% milk a little better.<br />But as far K-Cups go, this milk chocolate with the Coffeemate Chocolate Creamer is not bad.<br />And currently, it is less than $11.00 for 24 cups."
cocoa,great product for keurig coffee maker. works fine with coffees and cocoa mixtures. Is good for just hot chocolate. like purchase price
Best Chai Tea,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
TOTALLY LOVE POPCHIPS!,"I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again."
Way Overpriced,"Whoa...in doing my research I noticed that one box of South Beach Diet Bar Fiber Granola Bar (that's a mouthful isn't it) costs $23.92 if you order it on Amazon. I have prime but I realize that not everyone does so if you factor in another couple bucks for shipping...ridiculous price. I'm not sure how much a box of this costs in stores (considerably less I would hope) but I daresay that it is unlikely that the price is worth the product. If anyone could use a good diet bar it's me but the problem with diet bars is in the name. They are DIET bars. They aren't supposed to taste great (otherwise you'd be in danger of eating the whole box and what kind of diet is that) so instead they usually taste like a mix of cardboard and...well more cardboard. Now the South Beach Diet Bar Granola Bar isn't THAT awful. Don't take that delicious looking beast on the package for truth. The real product is much flatter...And the taste? Well it tastes exactly what you would think a chocolate diet bar would taste like. It's unfair for me to bash a diet bar based on taste after admitting that diet bars aren't SUPPOSED to taste good but that image on the package really got my hopes up.<br /><br />But how effective is the bar? Effective enough. I ate one this morning and I didn't eat again till later this evening. That's not really praise for the diet bar, I have a pretty hectic schedule. But maybe I didn't notice the hunger as much. I'm guessing I could eat a granola bar (get better taste at a cheaper price) and be the same level as hungry. So if you take diets/diet bars seriously then this might be the bar for you. It doesn't really have anything to separate it from the other snack bars out there other than the South Beach name but hey, what do I know?"
Cats Like It,"The cats liked this flavor, they haven't liked previous flavors from this company because they had too many veggies. This one was good to go with all the cats."
Not good...,"I decided to try this food with my 13 years old dog. He didn't like the taste, I had to combine it with something else for him to eat it.<br />Sounds like a good choice for old dogs, but what good it does if the dog doesn't eat it."
Great buy,"If you are in need of large quantities of good quality cayenne pepper, this is a great product.  We order it frequently and plan to do so in the future."
BFF is better food than some and not as expensive as others,"I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item, but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it (it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon).  I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices."
Quality products,This is only one of the 4 outfits I purchased from Silly Monkey for my daughters American Girl Doll.  I loved every outfit I purchased! They fit the doll perfectly and the quality is also awesome!  I will definitely be purchasing more doll clothes from Silly Monkey.
Best X-Bold,"I have tried many X-Bold coffee K-cups and find Jet Fuel the only ones strong enough for me. I Keep coming back to these, so now I am sticking with these for good. I don't understand, though, why the company took the ""X-Bold"" out of the name."
"Yummy, Yummy In My Tummy!","What could possibly be better in the whole food world then taking chocolate and fruit and paring them together? I'll tell you! Nothing! I bought a bag of BROOKSIDE DARK CHOCOLATE ACAI BLUEBERRY at my neighborhood COSCO for the excellent price of $9.59. My family and I gobbled them down as fast as we could and went back for more! Go get some and you can too! Check your own store in-person or on-line for prices and availability. This is a delicious product!<br />True they do not have blueberry's inside them. Uh...so what? Hopefully you won't make a meal of them. Think snack. Put them on ice cream, in pancakes, in a trail mix or eat them plain. Think, outside-the-box or bag in this case! These little treasures are fun to eat, taste good and are good for you! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039OVW74"">Brookside Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry 2 Pounds Resealable Bag [Misc.</a>] are great! Highly recommended! Enjoy!"
best choc cereal ever!!!,for some reason NJ supermarkets stopped selling this. and i tracked it down because it's my fav childhood cereal!!
Cheddar POPCHIPS are totally Yummy!,I am addicted to Popchips - I love the cheddar flavored ones. I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.  I know eat a bag of these and my craving is gone. They are actually healthy and for only 100 calories a bag and around 3 grams of fat - it is a much better choice than cheetos. They are very crunchy and full of flavor. I am ordering these again.
Very Crunchy Good Tasting Cereal,"The Quaker Oatmeal Squares are great tasting in milk or right out of the box. Made with whole oat and wheat flours they are exceptionally crunchy wet or dry. Unlike other cereal squares, the Quaker Squares are more dense (higher fiber) and are ribbed and have a solid oat taste that seems only lightly sweetened. I like them in milk but routinely eat the squares dry for dessert.<br /><br />For a serving size of one cup, there are 210 calories, 2.5g of fat (.5g saturated), 190 mg of sodium, 9g of sugars (brown sugar and sugar), 5g of fiber, and 6g of protein.  Although this list may not be the best for some people, the Oatmeal Squares may be a good substitute for  the high fat and sugar cereals that children (and adults) like. I think the solid crunch of the squares that holds up in milk will appeal to children, and they will not miss the super sweet taste of their current favorites.<br /><br />The price of food world wide is increasing, so you can expect a substantial price point per 21g box. But, unlike other cereals in comparable box sizes, you can feel the higher weight of the Quaker Oatmeal Squares. The density of the cereal in milk gives you a long-lasting full feeling, and when eaten dry makes for a great dessert substitute for cookies."
"Good, but definitely ceylon tasting","I am a huge fan of black teas, but ceylon-based teas have never been my favorite. I think this would be good if you like Amhad's Earl Grey (which, unfortunately, I don't), but might not be so good for people who like a more traditional black taste. The problem is that this is such a huge quantity, and not retunable, that I'm left with three caddies full of cardamom tea that I don't like. However, it's beautiful for gifts!"
Great Coffee,"This is an excellent blend perfect for any time. Was really surprised by the quality, flavor and finish."
So Glad I found this!,"Like others have mentioned, I frequently ran out of olive juice before running out of olives and was so grateful to find Dirty Sue. I have tried other brands of olive juice and many have had a fake, metallic taste to them. Dirty Sue tastes fabulous and makes a great dirty martini. We no longer worry about running out of the juice in the olive jar. I will be ordering more of this!!"
Tubs of enjoyment,My son loves sour candy and requested a big tub of this for his birthday...so he wouldn't run out.  Request granted and statisfied x 2.
Great for aggressive chewers,"I thought this toy looked a bit odd and boring. I wasn't sure my dog would like it. But, she does. Toys do not last around here. My dog chews up most toys I try to give her right away, but I gave her this about a month ago and she still hasn't completely chewed it up, but she has bit off a few very tiny pieces. When I purchased this I also got two other toys and they are lasting much better. I recommend the Nylabone Double Action Combo Bone Chew, Wolf, and the Nylabone big chew knot for big dogs."
YUCK!,These do not taste anything like popcorn or even cheese. Makes me think of cardboard with salt sprinkled on top.
Spectacular,"In my opinion, Ritter Sport is the absolute best of all the German chocolate brands. This particular flavor is fabulous.  Creamy milk chocolate, delicious and delicate hazelnut cream with crunchy wafer.  It is SO good, it is almost impossible NOT to eat the entire bar!"
hi,3rd party seller did an awesome job of getting the product to me very quickly.  Sauce very delicious
Great sauce for combination,"I eat couscous as my main carb staple daily and i always use Jyoti sauces like this to prepare it. For one bowl of couscous you will need about 1/3rd can of this to have a hearty filling meal. The saffron in this and other Jyoti sauces (all of them have it and taste almost similar) makes up for a special addictive taste that you will keep coming back to regularly.<br />To make a tasty bowl of couscous that will feed 1-2 person, use the following below.<br /><br />1/3rd can of one of the Jyoti sauces below.

Dandy Blend,"I was advised to stop drinking coffee or any caffeinated products, even so called decaffeinated products. I remembered that there was a product called Postum and as I recalled it did not taste good. As I Googled Postum, I discovered a product called Dandy Blend and decided to give it a try and wow was I happy I did. It is a marvelous product and I drink it all day at work in place of hot coffee. I will be bringing some home for the weekends."
garlic festival low sodium garlic garni,My family and I recently came across this product and absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone that loves garlic!  We put this on everything
Great quality Raspberry Leaf,"I trust Alvita's brand because all of the teas I have tried from them are pure and excellent quality. The Raspberry leaf is no exception. The taste is mild and it works like a charm to ease menstrual cramps. A must have during your moon cycle. Good value for the price.<br /><br />Also check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLQ"">Yogi Woman's Moon Cycle, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
Vegan Alfredo,"Like other reviewers already stated, the directions for how much H2O to add is WAAAAAY off! Following the directions will yield a gummy clump! The directions say to add 1/2 cup of H2O. When I make it, I add TWO cups of soy milk & vegan butter. This creates a thick, creamy sauce. The sauce is okay but still a bit bland for my taste. I also add garlic, herbs, and some nutritional yeast. It is delicious! On it's own, this product sucks, needs lots of extras but provides a good base for my vegan cream sauce."
can't get enough!,"my family loves these, they don't last very long in our house.  I send these to school so that when a mom brings in cupcakes, or cookies or something with gluten that my daughter cannot have, she has a nice treat that is really good, so she does not have to feel left out."
"good, but not purrrfect","For cats who like saucy foods, the fancy feast grilled range is a good bet. Our cat is pretty fussy, but he'll eat most of the grilled varieties. His favourite, by far, is grilled salmon, and judging by the fact that it's never in stock at the pet food store, it's a favourite of many other pussies too. Tuna is his next favourite, but he likes grilled chicken for a change now and then. Lots of sauce, convenient small cans for cats who don't eat a lot in one sitting, and pretty decent ingredients and smell. Three whiskers."
5 stars on taste,5 stars on taste. Beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili. The only thing that concerns me is the 11 grams of sugar. That can't be good for you.
My New Go To Coffee,I can no longer afford pure Jamaica blue mountain.  Reggie's Roast comes close - I don't know how much blue mountain is in the blend but I can definitely taste it.  On the subscribe and save program I'm getting it for $8 for a 12 oz can.  Just the ticket for my daily grind and brew.
"awesome,","This is an awesome tasting coffee, I love flavored coffee, this is my favorite, I love the rich taste and the Rasberry flavor mixed with chocolate is great."
Good Stuff!,"This is a very good product for any price. People knock it a bit because of the corn but I've spoken to Eagle Pack and have found they are very open about their product. Carbohydrates are carbohydrates are carbohydrates. No cat needs them. Ever! Apparently the grains used in this product are local to Indiana and surrounding areas (Michigan, Illinois, Ohio)? That's never a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. I've also read the company is non-GMO but I haven't confirmed that information through e-mail. The point is that unless your pet is allergic to corn or rice you're wasting your time going grain free. Potatoes and peas are just as useless as corn or rice and cats would never eat any of these in the wild. So if you want a food that is locally sourced (for the most part) and don't want to pay twice as much for Orijen simply because they use peas and potatoes this is a great option."
UNHEALTHY,Please dont feed your dog ONLY this. The only reason for the 2 stars is that i mix 4oz of this stuff into every cup of dry food and my pit loves it. She is a very picky eater and will refuse to eat any dry dog food.
I love this flavor k-cup!,"The Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend is my favorite brand of k-cup I've tried so far. I've tried about 6 different varities. This one is very smooth, has lots of flavor and tastes great with a little milk and sugar added in."
What won't my dog do for Zuke's Z-Filets?,"TRICKS.  For any other type of treat, Vesta will do anything I tell her to do.  When I pull out a Z-Fillet, she charges my hand!  It's rotten behavior, I know, but I love how much she enjoys these!  These are just rewards in my house, because they are clearly useless as training treats.<br /><br />I will only buy US made dog treats and food with high quality ingredients, and I swear by Zuke's.  I hope your dog will enjoy these (almost) as much as mine does!"
"Hands down, my favorite","We have had our Kourig coffee maker for several years now. My wife likes to try different flavors (right now German Chocolate is her choice) and I will occasionally have a cup of decaf at night. But Newman's has always been my favorite. It is just a great tasting, bold cup of coffee."
Great Stuff  One Healthy Dog with this food.,"Not all dog food is the same, the cheap dog food has tons of Fillers in it. Not healthy for your dog and they have to eat more to feel full, and they don't get what they need. My Boston behaves much better with this food over the cheap stuff. Do yourself & your Dog a favor and check out this dog food. You won't be disappointed."
Good Snack For Diabetics - Recommended,"These Emerald ""Cocoa Roast Almonds"" are a low carb snack that bring a bit of dark chocolate flavor to good tasting almonds. These do have artificial sweeteners, but for those of us that have to watch our sugar intake, this is a very viable treat.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
Good Organic cofee,This is a very good coffee esp for the price! It's a good alternative to the pricey Starbucks. It cups well with no bitterness
i'm addicted,"I have a document of about 10 pages of health benefits of aloe juice.  Add onto that the essential benefits of coconut juice.  Flavor that with natural sweetning.  I always know when my body is lacking something critical, because foods that contain these elements taste unbelievably good.  I have been addicted to this juice, which is why I need to order from Amazon in bulk.  Finally it is to the point of just tasting great, but I will continue to order as it is still my favorite beverage!"
I'm in love,"For medical reasons, I can not eat gluten.  So, some years ago when I learned this, I thought oatmeal would be off my table for good.  For those who don't know, oats can be cross-contaminated with wheat crops, thereby rending them not gluten-free.  This means anyone who is gluten intolerant can not eat mainstream oatmeal products.  So one day a couple of months ago, I saw this new Glutenfreeda oatmeal at my local family-owned health food grocery.  I bought a package and immediately realized how blessed I was that Glutenfreeda introduced this product.  The flavors in the variety pack are all great.  My favorite is the maple raisin, which is out of this world delicious.  I have dedicated myself to eating a bowl of hot oatmeal every morning.  I prepare it by nuking it for one minute with a half cup water, stir it a bit, then I pour a bit of Alm...d Br..ze vanilla flavored non-dairy almond milk, then a light sprinkling of sugar.  Pure Heaven!  Please, I don't have any connection to this manufacturer, but I know it's difficult for small companies to navigate the rough economic cycles.  I beg you, PLEASE support Glutenfreeda by trying this product!  Try it locally, just buy a box.  Then when you realize how delicious, buy it like I do, by the case from Amazon, with S&S discount, and free shipping!"
Good product..But dogs hate it!,My dogs hate it... I dont know if its just the flavor because my dogs dont even eat tuna fish. I am going to try the chicken next...
My dog loves this treat,"I learned about this treat in a magazine article reviewing it. I have been looking for convenient treat, which is small, dry (so that I don't have to keep in the fridge), and irresistible to my dog, which is almost impossible since my dog is not food motivated at all. A treat my dog loves most has been roast beef from deli which I have to go to supermarket every week to resupply. Then I saw this product review and decided to give it a try. I wasn't really expecting any enthusiasm from my dog since the treat is just dried piece of something that I couldn't even smell anything out of it. But to my surprise, my dog sniffed it and gulp! And he was waiting for the next piece intently looking at me. It seems he likes it as much as bloody roast beef! The product seems a bit costly per weight, but the pieces are so small and light, actually I got more in terms of number of pieces than I thought. I think I found a right treat for my dog."
BEWARE!!,This spice is fabulous for pasta salad or just a regular lettuce salad BUT DO NOT BUY IT HERE!!! You will get six 2.62 oz bottles that are waaaaaay overpriced! You can buy it at other online spice sites for a much cheaper price or even you local walmart or grocery store.
A truely great product!,"This cereal meets three major criteria:<br /><br />1.  It is low in sugar - no longer a kid and hate cereal that is too sweet.<br /><br />2.  Stays crunchy - the best flaked cereal I have found for staying crunchy in milk, maybe because the flakes seem a little heartier/thicker than standard flakes.<br /><br />3.  Taste - last but not least, too many of the healthier flakes taste like cardboard, but this cereal is so good I can eat it right out of the bag like a snack.<br /><br />This cereal is one item in my ultimate breakfast cereal mix.  The other ingredients are Kashi's 7 Whole Grain Puffs, dried cranberries, pecans, and flax seed. With Heritage & Kashi combined you get all the following grains in one breakfast:<br /><br />1.  Spelt<br /><br />2.  Quinoa<br /><br />3.  Kamut<br /><br />4.  Millet<br /><br />5.  Buckwheat<br /><br />6.  Triticale<br /><br />7.  Rye<br /><br />8.  Red Winter Wheat<br /><br />9.  Barley<br /><br />10. Oats<br /><br />11. Brown Rice<br /><br />12. Sesame Seeds<br /><br />Then I add the following to the bowl:<br /><br />13. Flax Seeds - about a tablespoon<br /><br />14. Pecans - about 2 tablespoons<br /><br />15. Dried Cranberries - about 2 tablespoons<br /><br />Then if you really want to go full-on healthy try Better Than Milk Original Flavor Vegan Soy Beverage, the best soy milk out there...see my review of it."
My Poodle Loves 'Em!,"When I got them, I was disapointed that the tiny treats were soooo small. I even tried to use other treats in my Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Dog Toy (ball), and Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug Treat Dispensing Dog Toy. Then I found that the other treats got stuck, and would not come out. When I put the small Buddy Berries in the ball - yes - it was just right! And, more importantly, my poodle absolutely loves them, and works hard to get every last piece out! They are extremely crunchy (which I think helps to keep the ball dry so that moisture doesn't gum up the opening).<br /><br />Great product!!"
Rocks a filet of fish,Sprinkle on both sides and fry in high heat w butter...an instant gourmet meal! I tried it on dolphin fish but choose your own
Stinky but my dogs love it!,"Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand."
Greatest invention since sliced bread!!,"I discovered Popchips when I was on a trip to Vegas.  I doubted I could find them when I got home and I was almost right.  I found a couple of stores that had them but only one flavor and the price was exhorbitant.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  They are low fat, low calorie, and still delicious.  The single serve bags are ideal for lunch or to throw in the car when on a short trip."
Unusually delicious.,This dish is simply super and so easy to prepare. 90 seconds in the microwave.  I sprinkle it with some powdered red pepper and add some hot mango chutney on the side for extra spice & top with roasted pumpkin seeds for extra crunch...and pour over rice noodles.  Wow!
oh come on!,"Product came on time. But the delivery didn't get to my address until late. I received a hot bag of goo. Totally ruined what was to be a sweet n sour evening, as I wait for it to reach room temp and cool again."
"Taste burnt, not roasted","Bought a bag of these yesterday.  Not only do they taste way over roasted, like a ""french-roast"" pistachio, they're a bit too salty, and I usually love salty foods!"
The same you get in Mexico,"Eso es el mismo producto que puede obtener en Mexico, pero mandado a su puerta. I have a friend in the States who loves the candy, and this is a much cheaper option than spending lots and lots of money shipping it from Mexico yourself. The package comes with twelve 12-count bags, for a total of 144 mini canisters -- it's a great deal for the price in my opinion."
Essential to making great popcorn,"I received a WhirlyPop popcorn popper for Christmas. After a little web research, quickly discovered that coconut oil, as used in the Real Theatre Popcorn Popping Oil, is a key ingredient to making great popcorn. Using regular canola or other vegetable oils just does not compare to using this popping oil. My family loves the popcorn we make with this oil. We will never eat microwave popcorn again."
Lovely product,"I use in cake, ice cream and spread.. Very versatile ! Love it. I would recommend the home chef to try this product. Affordable and tasty!"
Front mini wheats with a brand new kick!,"As someone who already enjoys mini wheats, I was eager to try the cinnamon rolls flavor and while I have no problem with the regular flavor, this is a good change-of-pace of flavor.  While I would not say it tasted like cinnamon rolls, it did remind me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch a bit.  As with regular mini wheats it was still sweet, but not too sweet, so this is by no means an old-fashioned sugary kids cereal."
Fresh as jerky can be,This double pack was delivered promptly.  I took advantage of the auto-ship subscription which discounts the order from $20.89 down to $17.76. I discovered after the fact that the same size package can be purchased at Wal-Mart at the same cost as this discounted price.
yummy,"These suckers taste way better than anything synthetic.  I agree with others regarding organic choices for common things, that they don't always live up to it, but these exceed those standards.  I am a family physician and bought these for my practice to replace the splenda sugar free suckers and am proud to be rid of those chemicals that were being distributed to my patients.  yummy"
Disappointing results,"I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor, all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste.  I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips.  Also, the companion pump didn't keep it's prime and had to be pumped several times to be reprimed every day and so the amount released was inconsistent which made it difficult to ""measure"" easily.  (1 pump, 1/2 pump, etc)<br />One ounce in an espresso was VERY strong and not pleasant, and a half ounce is just sweet without a white mocha flavor."
Yummy!,"This popcorn is delish!! Best every, will definately order again. Purchased microwave popcorn poppers for all family members for Christmas and gave them each some of this popcorn....everyone loved it!"
"If you want your dog to get sick, buy these","These treats literally made my dog sick, throwing up everywhere. And it wasn't a shock when i read the package which stated Made in China. Weren't chicken treats for dogs that are made in China recalled?"
Very Pleased,"I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from ""chronic"" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!"
not good for small dogs,my dog was too small to move the covers with her mouth or paws- I don't recommend for any dog under 20 lbs!
Excellent,"This mix is slightly sweet and a very nice, smooth dark chocolate flavor. I will likely order more before the hot chocolate season ends. I hope Amazon will continue to carry this brand."
great product,"I cannot find this product in any local grocery or market. I find a ""lite"" variety which is a very poor tasting product. Often those few suppliers who do carry this product are out. It is the dressing for my marinated chicken. It is the dressing for my salads, both green and pasta. It just happens to suit me and I rarely use any other."
"Great Tea, Fast Delivery","I have ordered this tea from Amazon multiple times. I just can't find the Bigelow Earl Grey kcups anywhere local. That's fine though, because they get it delivered so fast! I just got another shipment yesterday and it only took two days. I ordered it late Sunday night and it was on my doorstep by Tuesday at noon. That's 48 k-cups for about $20. Not bad at all!<br />I can find twinings earl grey locally at a store, but it's just not as good as the Bigelow Brand! Love this stuff!"
Love them!  Perfect for training!,"My puppy loves these!  They're small, moist and tasty - perfect for training and rewarding good behavior.  The chicken and peanut butter flavors are great too.  Good stuff!"
GREAT Product!,"I ordered an 8 oz. package of peppercorns...wow, just wow...that is a LOT of peppercorns. Unless you expect to use these a lot, think about a smaller package! I may be using these in the nursing home.<br /><br />My package arrived quickly, and was well packed. Looking at a previous review that insisted the package was lightweight, I weighed my bag of peppercorns upon arrival and it was exactly 8 oz. So I wouldn't be too concerned about a lightweight package.<br /><br />These peppercorns are beautiful, with a lively flavor and plump appearance. They are not shriveled like many peppercorns. I used them to make Kung Pao chicken and ZING they about burned my face off! But in a good way. Such peppery, fresh, citrusy hot flavor. Love them!!!<br /><br />If I ever run out (ever)...I will reorder from this seller!"
Corn?? Really??,"My two cats are both over 10 yrs of age - and they are different in how they eat - but one thing is for sure - they don't and can't digest CORN!!!  My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!"
cheez-it ! it's the cops,A WONDERFUL OLD STANDBY FOR GREAT SNACKING. GOTTA HAVE THEM.  YOU CAN TASTE THE CHEESE MUCH MORE THAN OTHER SIMILAR IMITATORS.
Trident Spearmint Gum,I ordered the gum online as the stores in my area stopped carrying it.  I received notice my order was received and was told would ship quickly which it was as I received it in just a few days.<br /><br />Thanks.
Too expensive to be worthwhile,"I almost bought it, but my wife told me that the local supermarket sells Lipton Herbals (20 count)for about the same price and without paying 1 dollar per box in shipping. So, why should I buy 6 packs and loose $4.95 in the deal?"
My dog LOVES them,These are crunchy rather than chewy.  I have to be careful not to give these too often as they seem to cause diarrhea (too much vitamin A?).  A great treat with excellent ingredients.
Back to childhood,"Eating these wonderful cookies is a trip back to childhood.  Although often imitiated but never really copies these cookies are a true delight.  With many imitators no one has ever beat Nabisco at the marshmallow in the center of the cookie, just soft enough but it does not string or pull like many others and the chocolate is the original sweet delight like I remember."
First Time Really Disappointed,"I posted this review for San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser K-Cups, but it bears repeating here:<br />I was enticed by the cool design - less trash is good. The price obviously was also very enticing.<br />When the coffee arrived, I carefully transferred the pods to a plastic ziploc bag.<br />So far, so good. I then proceeded to brew my first cup - all excited to have found something wonderful.<br />Well, the excitement ceased when the cup produced was pure black liquid with a flavor that was not pleasing to my palate - at all. Maybe if you like bitterness in a coffee without the pleasantness of a well-rounded rich coffee, then this is for you.<br />I found it not an experience to be repeated. I tried to like this coffee, but will go back to another brand. Sorry San Francisco Bay Coffee company - I really tried.<br />The same holds true for decaf French Roast - except it was even less likable..."
Madagascar vanilla beans,I am so so happy about the quick service and delivery. I am making  many wonderful things with the yummy vanilla beans. The homemade ice cream was much better with a vanilla bean added! Thank you and I will definitely order again from this provider.
Real Pizza Flour,If you want to make the most authentic pizza possible this is the stuff. Its amazing. Its great in every way. You can make more than pizza with it such as loves or ciabatta bread. This is the bomb.
My favorite concentrated insect spray...,it works great. just follow the instructions on the jug. it is shipped wrapped up tightly in a layer of tough plastic to make sure it arrives safely and it is placed in a box for safe shipping. i use it regularly around the base of my buildings. it takes care of the fire ants and other bugs that want to try to get inside. i use it around all areas that i don't want fire ants and other bugs to do damage to... such as the power pole and the well pump. the fire ants actually try to eat into the electrical parts. it works great and i am very happy with this purchase from amazon.com.
Not much there for the money.,"This package contains some foam seed holders, a few plastic cup sections to hold them, and some clear ""caps"" for the seed pods. Also, there are about a dozen blank circular papers to stick on the seed pods to identify your crop type. That's it!<br /><br />Re-use the original pod components and stay away from this item. $39.00 for $2.00 worth of plastic, paper, and foam."
Have switched primarily to this food for both my cats,"Fine product, great ingredients list. The cats really seem to like it, though one cat did slim down, the other one actually gained weight, but hopefully only to get to its' ideal weight."
great product!,"I own a candy and fudge shop at a tourist location. We make our own homemade fudge and we use these extracts and flavorings.  Our customers absolutely LOVE our fudge, and come from all over the country to get it. Locals drive over an hour just to come get our fudge.  I wouldn't use any other extracts - these work perfect for what we make.  We consistently use the raspberry and strawberry flavors, and they are great."
Excellent tea,This tea is excellent. Only tea I could find that is a loose tea not a tea bag!
No actual picture of the container...,"These sprinkles are great colors, and work perfectly for what I am using them for. But the container they come in is very short and doesnt come with that much sprinkles."
Mango Flavor is non existent,"I bought this for the mango but i could not taste or smell any mango flavor in this.<br /><br />This contains lot of sunflower seeds, Sugared red fruit pectin (mango), some  cashews, lot of raisins ....<br />I was not satisfied as i expected to get some mango goodness.<br /><br />I highly recommend this instead. Its got good mix of cashews, peanuts, banana chips that retain flavor and smell<br />. And its 2 oz for $5 more, extremely satisfying.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001651282"">Planters Trail Mix, Fruit & Nut, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 72)</a>"
candy delivered to your door...,"what's not to like, great kitkats show up on your door step. what could be better than that? they were fresh and perfect. I need to get more."
Terrible Coffee,"I love Sumatra and this had all the earmarks of being a premier brand with certified green cred.<br />Only problem is it tastes terrible.<br />Starbucks offers a much beter coffee at a lower price.<br /> Still searching for that perfect cup of Sumatra.<br />Don't buy this one, but tell me what you would recommend.<br />LL"
Fresh Stacks - Where Have You Been My Entire Graham-Cracker-Eating Life?,"I grew up eating Honey Maid Graham Crackers as an after dinner dessert snack.  My parents convinced me that it was even better than cake and to this day, I still crave a tall glass of milk and some Honey Maid Graham Crackers (never found another brand that was quite as yummy.)  They're still delicious, and as far as I can tell, the taste is exactly the same, but this packaging solves most of my biggest peeves with the crackers before.<br /><br />I no longer have to figure out how to break the thing in half perfectly along the lines to get it to fit into my glass of milk so that I don't lose half of the soggy goodness in the bottom of my cup.  These are the perfect size for dipping in milk and even better for Smores!  No more fumbling to break a cracker into the perfect Smore sized square while holding a flaming marshmallow!  Lastly, the stacks are individually sealed, so you can eat an entire stack without having the rest of the box go stale before you can finish the rest.  If there was one improvement I would suggest it would be to have the ""serving size"" be the same as a single ""fresh stack"" but since this isn't marketed as a calorie counting type of product, it doesn't really matter.  I'm hooked on these and since the Honey Maid graham crackers are still a treat for me, I'll be buying these instead of the normal rectangular crackers from now on. Yum!"
Numi Flowering Tea - Gift Set,This is a complete gift set of flowering teas with a small glass pot (tea for one). It comes in a lovely Bamboo keepsake box  - an impressive gift for a true tea lover.
In Love with this cereal ....,"I love this Cinnamon Chex Cereal ... it is so good I have trouble not eating the whole box at one sitting. The rice Chex has always been my fav, but now I have the best of both worlds. Yummmm is what I say."
"Excellent value, very fast shipping","I ordered this assorted bag as a birthday gift for my father, along with Ghirardelli's giant 5 pound milk chocolate bar.  The box arrived incredibly fast (in only two days with regular shipping option) and was well protected from the summer heat by ice packs.  My dad said the box weighed a ton and he almost hurt his back trying to lift it, so if I had any suggestion, it would be to ease up on the extra ice packs!  That said, I'm grateful for the fast delivery and added coolant to keep the items from melting into a wasted mess.<br /><br />If you like Ghirardelli chocolate (and you should), don't hesitate to order these for yourself or as gifts."
Very tasty - but may not be what you expect!,"Although described as a Jerky, this is a wet (clear slightly viscous liquid, just enough to make it that you need a napkin to eat it) product in a vacuum sealed pouch.  So if you are expecting a dry, crispy jerky you are likely to be disappointed.  However, the product within the pouch I found to be very tasty, and the fat portion of the bacon did have a bit of crunch associated with it, as opposed to a rubbery/fatty texture.  Great smokey/bacon flavor, reminded me more of sliced preserved bacon, as opposed to dry jerky.  I have not tried the other bacon jerkys yet to compare it.<br /><br />The delivery timing and packaging were first class.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br /><br />Pros:  Tasty, true bacon product, well packaged, great shipping including a small pack of toothpicks!  Very similar to candied bacon.<br /><br />Cons:  Product is wet, no something crispy, eat easily from a pouch or to cut up over a salad (although this would be good in one!).  Price is relatively high - to cover labor and packaging costs I'm sure.  A home consumer could make candied bacon that would be very similar at a much lower cost - but no shelf life or convenience!"
Sno-Balls tasted great but are overpriced,"The title for this item is confusing, it says 2 boxes of 12 cakes. That means you get 24 Sno-Ball packages, right? Wrong. You get 6 Sno-Ball packages and they do not come in boxes other than the shipping carton. These could be purchased much cheaper from any local stop-and-go market or gas station. The vendor did refund me $5 for the confusion but I was still very disappointed."
These are TOO yummy!!!!,"I am adult, supposedly in my right mind, just turned 59 years old, and I am a closet lover of these little gummi frogs. Well, not totally. My work colleagues see them hidden in the back corner of my desk (I try to hide them), and they laugh their heads off that I'm eating these things. I regularly go to the ethnic market next door and buy every bag they have left. Then I have to go gummi-less until the next shipment comes in - aaaarrrrghh! Plus the checkout girls look at me funny when I buy these armloads of little froggies. Well, I decided to see if there was somewhere where I could buy them in bulk and in secret - and AMAZON came through again. Will wonders never cease. I can't believe it - I can buy them a dozen at a time through Amazon and no one will be the wiser .. except the trash guy. I even smuggle the bags out of work when I'm done scarfing these things down because people see the empty bags in my trash and they laugh some more. Thank you, Amazon, for fulfilling my dreams once again. You're the best!"
Not to strong. No bitterness,I have purchased Breakfast Blend and Timothy's Donut Shop Blend Coffee.  This coffee (Breakfast Blend) is just right for that morning cup of coffee - perfect to get you going.  Found Newman's too strong.
Yummy!,One of my favorite teas. It is only a seasonal item in the store. So after the holidays I order a box to keep my mornings happy. :)
"Pilon, en mi rincon!","Growing up in a typical Puerto Rican family, all we knew was Pilon coffee. Now as an adult with my own family, nothing wakes me up like the aroma of freshly brewed Pilon. Hispanics are all about their coffee and Pilon is definitely one of the best. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
I'm a Fiber One Banana Nut,"I love these muffins and can't get them anyplace near me.  This subscription is more convenient and even cheaper than I got them at Walmart!  As a T2 diabetic, these are a yummy breakfast choice that doesn't shoot my blood sugar through the roof."
Oops! Wrong Macaroons..........,"I had bought the original Jennies Coconut Macaroons in the local health food store for years, and then I decided to buy them online, but I didn't notice that these are ""almond flavored"".  I have some health issues (including marathon migraines), so I'm very sensitive to unnatural foods and flavorings, and these taste so artificial.  Good thing they keep so well because I didn't want to throw out the whole case, and I've been showing up at gatherings for a while now with these.  Some people think they're wonderful, but I can't eat them.  I've signed up to be notified when the original ones become available."
Good coffee,This is a little cheaper per bag than my local store and delivery to the door.
Not good,It didn't work well for me in the microwave. Will not purchase a 2nd time.
Better than regular oatmeal!,"I got a pack of these to eat while I did a gluten-free experiment, and like the texture so much more than regular oatmeal that even after I determined I don't have a major gluten intolerance, I keep buying these. They don't get as gummy/starchy as other oatmeal seems to (which I actually didn't even notice until after I tried these and then tried regular oatmeal again!). Also, even though it says to cook 10-20 mins, I always cook it the same amount of time as other oatmeal -- 5 mins and let sit covered for 2 mins -- and it's perfect. Just wish it were a little less expensive."
best vegetarian jerky,"There really aren't any vegetarian jerkies that replace meat jerky.  Some vegetarian jerkies are so horrid, it is surprising they made it to market.<br /><br />Even in their tiny packages, a lot of vegetarian jerkies are so bad I can't finish them.<br /><br />But there are a lot of varieties of this brand that we like:  teriyaki, hickory, and thai peanut are our favorites.  This is seitan, which is a chewy gluten product.  It is stringy in texture, moist, and is a good match for the flavors.  There are some flavors I don't particularly like, such as the lime flavor, but even the ones I don't like seem like someone else would. (As in, I don't like barbecue potato chips, but I can see where someone else would.)"
K-cup Coffee Sampler,"Enjoyed having a different flavor of coffee when I desired, that is the advantage of<br /> having the Keurig for the variety without purchasing large quantities of different coffees.<br />I continue to think the cost must go down on these K-cups."
Fresher than ever!!!,"These individually packed graham crackers by Honey Maid are such a  great idea. The crackers stay fresh and crispy and you don't have to stress over eating the entire pack because you fear they will become stale. These are a great idea for children or individuals who want a nice,quick, and easy snack that has a great package that's very effiecent.<br /><br />I will defiently buy this newly packaged graham crackers so that I can have a simple snack and not have to worry about binging on an entire pack of crackers. The packaging does not travel well but if you place it on the top of the lunch bag or purse then you have a nice fresh snack perfect for work or school.<br /><br />In today's society with many children overeating and becoming more overweight I think that small steps like these can help parent's maintain control with some of the overindulgence that has been going on with our children. Great idea Honey Maid and good job."
disappointed,"When I recived my maca powder a lot of  it had leaked out in the shipping box.  I seems that you can't return grocery items so I feel basically cheated out of $15 bucks, because who wants to eat somthing that was shipped in a box damaged enough to leak. So..I say buyer beware"
Excellent Tea,"Don't mind the reviewer saying it tastes nasty.  It's quite good, and, as with any tea, you can brew it as light as you want.  I don't think this tea is too strong at all, I brew it with the hottest water I can for as long as I can.<br /><br />It's a very healthy, tasty, beneficial tea.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />e"
Siljans Croustades Big Hit,"I was desperate to find these shells and after visiting a number of retailers, went to Google and discovered they were on Amazon! Filled them with Gorgonzola and peach jam, topped with an almond ... Lightly toasted in oven. Many raves and everyone wanted to know where the shells came from. Of course I told them."
Tasty Product,Great Northern's cherry cotton candy floss is delicious!  It is easy to use and works wonderfully in our home model cotton candy machine.  I will order more of this flavor and look forward to try Great Northern's other flavors.
My dog loves these,"My dog has food allergies so it's hard to find snacks for her since she can't have biscuits or meaty treats. She loves these!! The are dried so they can be a little tough to chew so they might not be great for older dogs, but my yellow lab loves them (she's about 4 years old). These treats are highly recommended. She eats one almost every day as her night time snack."
"kid loved, parent loved",MAde by the great brand that does adult snacks now for kids. all natural and organic. have great flavor and are good for you. my kids love them and I have ate a few myself. definately worth the price when u compare it to the cheaper not good for them fruit snacks.
Excellent Dog Treat!,"I'm writing this review, however, if my dog could write it, or say it, she would positively rave about this treat! I have a 6-year-old Bichon Frise who loves these dog biscuits - or as she knows them, ""cookies""!  She loves the flavor of peanut butter, which is why I bought these originally to try. However, I was pleased to know that the other ingredients in these dog biscuits are oatmeal, eggs, apples and carrots and that everything is made natural. I want my dog to have good snacks (and food!) - and I want her to enjoy what she's eating, too. I have made my third purchase of this product as she loves them - she never hesitates to gobble the ""cookie"" quickly. She loves them and I know they're good for her - we're both happy! And to top it all off - the price is definitely right! I buy the mini-size as my dog is small. I highly recommend this high-quality dog treat!"
Overrated,"When I saw this coffee rate top with Consumer Reports, over Dunkin' Doughnuts and other boutique coffees, I thought I would give it a try. I like exotic starbucks and peets coffees but I am not too snooty to enjoy a can of columbian coffee from the grocery store. Dunkin Doughtnuts coffee, for example is very good.<br /><br />Eight 0'Clock sucks grinds. It is a very dull, boring coffee with little to recommend it. I guess I could say that there is no off flavor like in some of the canned coffees.<br /><br />Other than that, not much to say. If you are indifferent to flavor and just like the ritual of grinding and drinking hot black liquid, this might be your brand."
Nothing Better,BBQ is my favorite flavor for all Popchips.<br /><br />Popchips are Healthy (as fas a a chip goes) and flavorful. The best chips I have ever eaten
OVERPRICED,"Great product, but I pay 75 cents per pouch at our local grocery store.  Here they are selling for over 2 dollars a pouch.  I was hoping to put a few cases on monthly shipment but given the price I will keep buying them at the grocery store!"
tangy,"If you like your drink not so smooth and a bit ""tangy""...this should work for you ....but... alas! ... not for  me.."
Great Popcorn!,"I bought the subscription to save money, hoping that the popcorn would be good.  I bought the 4 oz. to use with the Whirly Popper.  The first shipment of popcorn came extremely fast, within a day or two and I quickly popped up a batch to try it out.  It was delicious, light and fluffy and very good flavor.  Perfect.  I would highly recommend.  I'll probably buy a subscription for my popcorn loving sister-in-law.<br />I was very pleasantly surprised both with the fast shipment and the yummyness.  We will definately continue with the subscription."
"""Now"" brand, Virgin Coconut oil",This stuff is great. It adds a very subtle flavor whenever I cook with it. I did some research on it and found that it is really good for a person's physical health.
Delicious,"I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor."
The Real Deal!,"Throat-burning, eye-watering, sinus-clearing, foot-stomping brew - this is the real stuff. This is Caribbean-like strong ginger beer. I am ready to purchase two more cases. Weak-heart need not apply!"
Love these Chips - Beware of Sodium,"I love these chips a whole lot! This is also a great deal for them on subscribe and save when I compared it to the normal price I pay per bag in the store. The chips are yummy and taste natural. Some are very crunchy and a little hard to bite so I would not recommend these for elderly individuals or people who need or prefer softer food. My only issue with these chips is that they seem a little salty. Most people I let try them kept commenting on the sodium level as well. I kinda love salt, and don't plan on giving it up too much right now, so they are great to me! The sodium is just a warning for those who are watching their intake to do their research."
Delicious!,"I had a friend turn me on to coconut water for running because of the high amounts of potassium it has. It also has no added sugar and is a great alternative to gatorade. I think it tastes great cold and I like the convienince and packaging of the 1 quart boxes. I hope they continue to use the boxes instead of plastic because it biodegrades a little easier. Amazon had a great deal on a 6 pack of these, and you can't get them cheaper anywhere else. I paid about $1.70 for an 8 oz box in a grocery store. This was $3-4 for 4 times the amount."
Best Kitty Food Money Can Buy!,"Layla is extremely picky and has left certain luxury brand wet foods out to waste simply because they were unappetizing to her (How? I don't know!). And yes, she is probably too spoiled =), but I recently adopted her malnourished and hyperthyroid and I have been trying my best to get her on a healthy eating schedule. Anyway, the only flavor she goes absolutely nuts over is the Polynesian BBQ! She will go on hunger strikes if I don't have that flavor around. I don't know what they put in this flavor (crack? =)) to make Layla go nuts, but it's all she wants and now I'm forced to keep buying it.<br /><br />If you have a cat that has problems eating or is malnourished/anorexic (like Layla was), you would be hard-pressed to find food as high quality and apparently tasty as Weruva. My body-builder boyfriend remarked that perhaps if he gets hungry late one night he might pop open a can! It is made from free-range animals, and is processed in a human-grade facility. My only gripe, and it is VERY small, is that most of the food looks the same in the can (particularly the chicken flavors), so it feels like I'm not feeding Layla a variety or something special sometimes. And maybe cats prefer it like that--I do know they can be creatures of habit, so who knows?<br /><br />Again, if you have a picky or skinny cat, I would not hesitate to pick up a few cans of either polynesian bbq, steak frites, or grandmother's chicken soup. They are similar in price to other ""luxury"" brands, but the quality of Weruva is far superior. You aren't losing anything, and you may end up with a very happy cat =).<br /><br />EDIT: Layla had to stop taking her methimazole due to side effects, and while we were working with her vet for other options, her stooling and over-urination (polyuria) have normalized. ! I am certainly not attributing this solely to the food, but I think the high quality nutrition and supplements she has been receiving have helped Layla heal and perhaps  helped to correct some of her metabolic abnormalities. AND on a side note,  when I received Layla, her hair was like matted wire that fell out with just petting; now it is getting silky, and without those pesky oily parts (you know, behind the front legs?). She is really becoming quite beautiful."
Better than average,"This is better than other canned tuna in olive oil. It's chunkier and tastier.  Especially good for the recipes in ""The Mediterranean Prescription"" by Dr. Angelo Acquista....a fantastic book & recipes for following a Mediterranean way of eating."
No more Black Tears,"I am a white, white Maltese. Before Mommy started giving me the Pro-Treat Beef Liver, freeze dried, my tears were black and stained my face. With my enjoying one treat per day, my beautiful white face is so beautiful.  I eat only natural, non colored food and drink spring water. But Mommy says the treats were the icing on the cake. AND, I love them too."
Excellent product in perfect condition,"I have used this product very successfully many times before (mixed in with Party Animal canned food as a topping on Acana kibble) when my dogs needed some extra fiber but I always bought it from a pet store. One of my dogs had diarrhea, and then the medication the vet prescribed plus the bland diet of white rice and boiled chicken promptly caused constipation. After 3 days of not ""going"" I knew I needed to get some pumpkin again. Since my work schedule this week was such that I couldn't make it to the pet store until the weekend and I didn't want to wait that long, I decided to check if Amazon might have it. I was pleasantly surprised to see that yes indeed they do, and at a much lower price than I had been paying (+ free shipping since I have the Prime membership). I was, however, turned off by the several negative reviews of the cans being shipped severely dented. At the end I decided to order anyway, figuring that I can always return the defective cans. Well, I am glad I did! My order arrived the next day, and every single can was in perfect condition - not a scratch or the tiniest dent on any of them - with expiration date Sept. 2014. I am stocked up and ready for the next tummy trouble. (Oh, and since it contains nothing else but 100% organic pumpkin, I have also used it to make pumpkin pancakes for us humans. Delicious! :-)"
delicious!,"Perfect for any jelly bean lover.. especially jelly belly jelly beans. you get a wide variety of flavors when you order belly flops. and they are so neat to look at. some are deformed, but taste just as delicious as the regular ones."
"The ""Original"" is the Better Choice. The garlic/lime variants are a bit heavy handed and don't match the quality of the Original","I much prefer the original Cholula hot sauce. This variant adds a heavy dose of lime to what was and is a good hot sauce.  Buy the original hot sauce and if you want to add some lime -- then add it yourself. At the very least, then you can control the amount of lime added.<br /><br />The original Cholula hot sauce was and is quite successful and for good reason -- it is really tasty. Unfortunately some marketing ""genius"" came up with a lime and garlic version of the original sauce. In both cases ---  the lime or garlic versions are so heavy handed that they obscure the finer nature of the underlying sauce.<br /><br />Try the original version before even considering these heavy handed variants.<br /><br />PS: Watch out for high shipping charges that do not decrease even if you are purchasing multiple bottles at the same time! Review the final shipping charges before you check out here on Amazon. They may be much higher than you where lead to believe. Some companies on Amazon attempt to profit by offering very low prices combined with very high shipping charges. Buyer be aware!"
Samplers,"A good selection ,my only question is why must all samplers contain Decaf,hafcaf . I have a drawer full, and a bunch of tea which i will never use. I willnot buy more until i can find STRAIGHT COFFEE ONLY."
"Convenient, healthy treats for training","We use these treat sticks to train our Labrador Retriever puppy. They break cleanly into small bits, are easy to dispense, and don't leave a meaty smell or greasy residue on one's hand. The only downside is that over time, the sticks tend to get rather hard."
Yummy,"My cats love these treats, but eat them too fast. They don't take as much chewing and crunching as I expected them to. Breath is a little fresher, but I am still waiting to see long term effects for keeping their teeth cleaner."
Burnt food,"I've been buying Natural Balance Duck and Potato for my dog for over 2 years.  This is the first time I've every purchased the dry dog food from amazon, and probably the last.  This batch was over cooked, has a burnt smell to it.  The food is usually a light brown color, this is a dark brown color.  Marley is a picky eater, and still eats it, but I would recommend staying away from getting is directly shipped from amazon."
Great fall flavor,This K-Cup flavor is fantastic! I have had K-Cup flavors in the past and have been disappointed but not with this one. The pumpkin spice flavor is not overpowering and is light in intensity. Both the wife & I love it and we plan on placing another order.
The only Tuna we eat!,"We're non-red-meat people. Tuna is our primary fish preference, and Henry & Lisa's is the best we've found. It is not easy on the pocketbook, but for special occasions, you do get what you pay for."
Just Right,"The Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoon Clean & Refresh works as advertised.  The fragrance is pleasant but not overly deafening like many of the new shampoos that have come out in recent years.  I've used Head & Shoulders for years and this one works just as well, perhaps a little better, no flakes so far.<br /><br />What I really like about it is that with a small amount one can generate a great deal of lather, which makes washing one's hair far easier, and this also makes the bottle last much longer than the competition.<br /><br />As far as the refreshing feeling it's supposed to generate, it is indeed invigorating, unlike other anti-dandruff brands that claim the same but actually produce a burning sensation instead.  This one is clearly designed for those of us who have more chemically sensitive scalps.<br /><br />Design wise the bottle's quite utilitarian, easy to open, store and it doesn't wobble over easily, which isn't a major concern but nonetheless it's an added bonus.<br /><br />I'm usually reticent when it comes to trying new products in this genre, but I've definitely found a worthy alternate to my usual shampoo.  Highly recommended."
Cornuts are good,"Crunchy fried corn with a great BBQ seasoning. They got here quickly and are fresh, gone in three weeks. Some of the bags didn't have the ridges on the top or a notch so they where a little hard to open."
No sugar Jam,Not bad but a little too sweet tasting for me even with Xylitol as sweetener.  Would not purchase again but thought I'd try & take a chance as we have Diabetics in our family.
Good product,"I only use raw sugar, it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. Will buy again."
not like sushi bar tea !!!!,"this has to be the worst green tea EVER .... dont believe this tea tastes anything like the hot green tea i get  at any sushi bar . dont order this tea if you want that taste .... i went ahead and ordered the brown rice tea i usually get ,its much better ."
Makes giving meds so easy!,"Pill Pockets are awesome and the only way to give tablets/capsules to my cat.  I tried the brute force approach and it was a struggle every day.  Now, with Pill Pockets, my cat doesn't even know she's taking her medicine.  Love them!!"
My baby's favorite dinner,"My six month old baby loves the Earth's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it's his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth's Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin."
My favorite Green Tea,"I used to drive to an out of the way grocery store for Stash Moroccan Mint.  When they stopped carrying it I  was so upset!  It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!"
crunchy and delicious,"Very very good! It's like when you make a pizza and the cheese melts off and hits the pan and gets all crispy, only much more convienient since it's in a single serving bag. Just to warn you, this is dry, seasoned, crunchy cheese. If you are expecting something chewy, you will be sorely mistaken. Great for gluten-intolerant people(like me) too!"
I actually heard about the formula change and properly transitioned my dog without issue,"I have been using this food for 4 years since I read raving reviews on many sites. I was looking for a reasonably priced food which was better in quality than the cheap chain crap. I didn't want to pay $2 a pound for a high quality food and Canidae was just right for my budget and quality needs. My dog loves it (but you can't really judge it on that alone as he is a lab and will eat anything) however his coat is nice, his stool is the right consistency, and he is hardly ever ill. He also NEVER EVER has gas (but he does burp from time to time but not smelly like others have mentioned.) I wasn't happy when the price increased and the quality supposedly dropped a bit but I am still happy with this food overall and have continued to use it. I am always on the lookout for high quality food at a reasonable price so if anyone knows of something high quality at around the same price point please respond to this post and let me know.<br /><br />On a different note, was I the only person who actually DID hear about the formula change before it was too late? When I went to purchase more food and saw that the 40lb bag was discontinued I went looking for a reason why and to make sure there weren't any other issues. Right on their website it mentioned the formula change, bag change, and the proper way to transition your dog from the old to the new food to avoid digestive issues. As I had 1 full bag of old formula left, I followed the instructions and guess what, no issues whatsoever with the transition. My dog did NOT get sick at all and has not had a single problem with this food new or old formula."
hmmm,"took about 3 weeks to receive this order.  cost about $5 for shipping, but it's just taped to a piece of bubble wrap, put in a small manilla envelope with a standard .42 cent stamp.  seems to be taking many rounds of new milk turning into a funky kefir (not good kefir), I'm on my 5th batch and it's still not right. I'm still giving it 3 stars because, maybe it's me doing something wrong to get funky kefir?"
Wonderful to Eat,"I was looking for a recipe for sugar free marshmallows, when I found these already available to order. They arrived quickly and are delicious. I have eaten them alOne and used them in hot chocolate and love them."
kind bar,really good snack pricey but worth it get em in bulk start grubbin keep some in the car great for bike rides forget powerbars!
My cats love it!,"My cats are 10 years old, and have eaten dry food their entire life. I would give them wet pouches once in a great while as a treat. However, about 6 months ago, the female started puking on a daily basis, and let's just say it was not a ""normal"" type. I tried different brands (they had been eating Cat Chow Indoor Formula), but she is no longer interested in dry food (the male will still eat it). So I started buying Friskies pouches, and they seemed to really like it, but I noticed that little by little, they started leaving more and more food. They would only lick the gravy and leave the food.<br />Finally I tried this Whiskas item, and they seem to really love it, and they eat every bite. I'm glad I finally found something she will eat, because she has visibly lost weight.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon's price is more expensive than a grocery store, but unlike some other people who misuse these ratings, I am rating the PRODUCT, not Amazon. The 5 star rating is for the cat food alone.<br />I'll go to a message board if I want to discuss Amazon's business practices."
Gloria Jean's Coffee - Hazelnut,"Gloria Jean's Coffees, Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig.  Tasted fine but was hoping for a bit more Hazelnut flavor.  In their defense I have found most K-Cups not to have a strong flavor like fresh brew coffee.  Product good, would buy again, but the flavor was not over the top."
coconut in the morning?,"I did not know this had a coconut flavor or aroma as I got it in a variety pack. I put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no I don't like sweet in the AM. But its not sweet, I am quite surprised at the flavor and how I like it. Would I like it every morning..NO but it was a nice change. Made me feel I was waking up in a Jamacian cottage on the ocean hearing carribean music, well maybe not but it was close"
I have a brand new dog!!,"Oh my goodness...I have an 11 year old pug/beagle mix that has been lethargic for about 3 years, wouldn't really play, had a dull coat no matter how much I groomed her, and has had itchy paws and armpits for a long time. I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD! THE PUPPY'S COAT ACTUALLY SPARKLES LIKE I PUT GLITTER ON HER IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT'S CRAZY. THE PUGGLE IS ONLY SHEDDING A THIRD OF WHAT SHE USED TO AND THE ONLY THING THAT SHE EVER CHEWS ON IS ONE OF HER PAWS AND THE VET GAVE ME A SPRAY FOR THAT. I AM STILL THRILLED WITH THE FOOD AND WITH AMAZON'S PRICE AND THE FREE SHIPPING!"
Wonderful hot or cold!,"This is my favorite of the K-Cup Chai recipes. The spices are balanced though fairly strong allowing this tea to hold up well with the additions of honey (or sugar) and milk. It's wonderful served hot or cold. For the cold version, add your honey (or sugar) and milk, stir, and then pour over ice. When doing the iced version, I find it works best brewed on the 6oz size and then poured over ice in a 24oz glass. I prefer this to the Chai Latte K-Cups because I can control the amount of sweetener and milk."
"Terrific flavor has changed, but Amazon keeps the old pictures","Van Houtte's Costa Rica Tarrazu was the BEST, but unfortunately the manufacturer has changed the formula. Instead of a sweet, mild, light roast that even people who dislike coffee could love, VH changed it to a more medium, more bitter, more dark roast (even though it says light).  Even though I dislike coffee, I love my Keurig - and was so happy to find a great flavor and devastated that VH changed it from ""Costa Rica Tarrazu"" to just ""Costa Rica"" (you'd think coffee manufacturers would want to keep a flavor that would be a ""gateway flavor"" for folks with sweet tooths!) I was thrilled when Amazon pictured the old style of Tarrazu (two colors, word ""tarrazu"" included) and tried buying it in December from Royal Buy.  To this date, they STILL have not responded to my two letters complaining that they did not send the old style as pictured, but the new formula (single brown color, ""tarrazu"" not on it). I have 47 k-cups I don't want to drink, no response much less an exchange or refund, and it was a terrible price.  What's worse, Amazon is continuing to show pictures of the old formula from other sellers.  ""We3_Sell_Stuff"" was kind enough to write and warn that they are selling the new formula; have not heard yet from Coffee Filters.  This is not the only product where Amazon pictures a (better!) old formula (liquid soap comes to mind), meaning it is hard to trust what to buy for those of us hoping to find the last of an older formula of a favorite product.  Caveat emptor!<br />(Rating is difficult - 5 stars for old flavor; 1 star for new flavor; 0 stars for Amazon's misleading photos & for Royal Buy)."
Cinnamon,My wife & I love the Watkins Natural products and the Cinnamon flavor is better than similiar kinds at the grocery stores.
Gummy and overly sweet.,"My 3 year old son is allergic to all nuts and soy.  When I saw this in the store I thought it would be a great way to make a fast dessert the whole family could eat.  The 3 year old told me it was yucky, ate the frosting off his slice and then threw the cake itself away.  As stated in the title it is gummy and way too sweet.  I will not be purchasing this product again.  There are other mixes that have much better results and making a cake from scratch is not that difficult."
"Taste more like ""Tomato and Basil"" than ""Chili and Lime""","NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now."
Cats devoured,"When I first opened the package of Petite Cruisine Grilled Tuna the cat was no where in sight.  But I swear I wasn't done opening it and she came running.  And begged and begged and begged.<br /><br />The removal of the treat from the bag was not an enjoyable experience.  You will get the juice and the stink all over your hand and they don't stay together as one piece, they flake apart (as fish is supposed to I guess).  Next time I will use a fork to remove them from the package.  But the cats LOVED these treats.  Would I buy them?  Yes, as a special treat for the kitty's I would.  As an everyday treat?  No - too messy and hard to handle."
Hot and Delicious,"I purchased sriracha on the recommendation of a friend and boy am I glad that I did.  Sriracha provides heat and flavor to a dish, but doesn't set your mouth on fire (like hot wing sauce).<br />It is good on everything from eggs, to chicken wings, to krispy kale chips.<br />So if you need a fantastic ""go to"" sauce this is the one (also fantastic mixed up in some mayo for a spicy mayo spread)."
Best low carb cereal--South Texans eat with HEB Mootopia milk!,"I am a superbly picky eater because I love sugar. This cereal tastes a but like raisin bran to me. I eat it with HEB Mootopia milk, which is also lower carb than regular milk, and it tastes great. Also, it helps my digestive system lots. :) Try it! Cereal sold at Wal-Mart too."
Excellent Iced Tea,These tea bags make fool-proof iced tea that tastes great and doesn't suffer from cloudiness from over steeping regular tea.
Excellent dog food for my picky eater.,"I have a Basenji dog who, from time to time, becomes rather picky about what he eats.  So far he has never refused to eat any of the Cesar Canine Cusine varieties and usually consumes them as soon as he can get at his bowl.<br />I am very pleased with his condition, very active and a shiny coat and none of the bad breath, which occurred with other foods."
Best balanced Bold K-Cup with value to boot.,The past two years this has been my go to Bold.  The 50 pk is a great value and the coffee reminds me of Rain forest Espresso or Santa's Buzz.
Very happy with Chocolate Oranges,"I'm very happy with Terry's Chocolate Oranges.  My sons head straight to their stockings Christmas morning - just to dig out these fabulous treats.  Great Customer service, too!"
"Good, but not great","Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding."
"Good, strong cup of coffee","This is my daily morning cup of coffee.  I like strong coffee and this has become my favorite. I do not like the coffee at, say, Dunkin' Donuts. In the afternoons, I like Coffee People decaf or Timothy's decaf Hazelnut.  But for a good, regular cup, Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold is it."
"Lots of flavor, not a lot of bad stuff","These chili lime chips have only 100 calories and 4 grams of fat per bag. Most 100-cal snacks that I have had are tiny portions, but these chips are a normal sized serving.<br /><br />They aren't my favorite Pop Chip flavor, but there definetly is a lot of taste. It is strong flavor that grows on you. When I first tried them, I would have said 3 stars, but now I really like them. A few other Pop Chip fans I talked to rate them at 3 - 4 stars too.<br /><br />In the end, they are pretty not-too-bad-for-you, but the taste is, well... a matter of taste."
Like homemade...,"Well, if you ask my son, he might tell you it's better than his mommy's homemade oatmeal raisin cookies. :/ He loves the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and says they are ""Soft, chewy and Yummy!"" I'll be buying more!"
Horsetail Grass Tea,Too early to know.  I was recommended that this product helps out the joints.  I have been enjoying the tea going on one week.
Great deal,"I used to buy the 2 packs almost daily at over $5 a pack. When I saw this case I just had t get them. I love 5 hour energy. I only use them on long drives now, but its s till a great product!"
petroleum aftertase,The molasses itself and everything that I've baked using this molasses ends up with a peculiar petroleum aftertaste. I have mentioned this to others and they have likewise experienced the same aftertaste. At least being unsulfured it will stands a better chance of passing emissions if burned...
Most Natural without any artificial sweetners,"I grew up drinking coconut water of the freshly cut fruits from trees. I tasted all the brands except ""Zico"". I found ""Naked"" the closest to the fresh natural coconut water. It didn't taste any artificial contents nor sweeteners like other brands taste probably to enhance taste. Especially Vita coco does taste like natural coconut water with little bit of added sweetener flavor. This is my personal opinion. I use ""Naked"" coconut water for my 18 Months Old Daughter daily.<br />Jan 15th 2011: I'm satill using it. Its been couple of Months now and by far this is the Best"
Son's favorite Christmas present ;-),I purchased this for my son for a Christmas gift and he loved it.  He puts it on everything.
"Happy Cat, Happy Owner","I adopted a young cat and was feeding Purina Cat Chow. My cat would eat and eat and EAT and then beg to eat more. She was eating the dog's food. She had a lot of gas and freakishly large bowel movements for a 7lb cat. After doing some research I decided to switch her to a higher quality food and see how she adjusted. We are at the end of our second bag of Blue Buffalo Duck recipe cat food. My cat has more energy (oh joy :P), her gas is non-existent now and her poo looks like it came from a cat not an elephant. On top of that her coat is glossier, she doesn't eat the dog food anymore and I feed her much less than I used to. This food costs an arm and a leg, but you get what you pay for. Good nutrition isn't cheap. McDonald's vs Whole Foods."
A nice sized treat,"Sometimes you want to give your best friend a nice treat that isn't too small, nor too big and this is it.  My dog is actually a medium sized one, but these are big enough that she is kept busy for a minute or so, yet not so large that I worry about her having ""too many treats"".  Bottom line -- she loves them."
best sleep ever,"I usually need a xanex and 5mg of melatonin (ingredient in this drink) to fall asleep, and to stay asleep. Having an anxiety disorder I am always ""revved."" I tried Dream Water, but the effects vs cost weren't worth it. I saw this on display at my local grocery store and figured what the heck. I was asleep in no time, slept the whole night and was relaxed in the morning and refreshed. Whatever combination this has works.<br /><br />And I did take it with the xanex, so it did not cause problems with my prescription meds - although I wouldn't recommend it, I'm just saying I didn't have problems.<br /><br />I came to Amazon to order since the store I found it at hasn't had any - even my kids look for the orange bottle! Being a better parent is an awesome side effect. :)"
"Good for Diabetic Cat, Low Carb","This is one of the low carb cat foods that work for a diabetic cat.  My cat likes this food and is willing to eat it which is a relief since she doesn't like wet food in general.  Since going on this food, she has stablized and is doing well.  I recommend it."
Clean and Good,I have found this 25 lb bag of seed to be clean and clear of unwanted items. We are enjoying it very much. It is so much more reasonably priced than Mall health food stores.
spewing coffee grounds all over,these pods are defective . They spew coffee grounds all over the place and in the cup of coffee. I use others and this is the only one I've had a problem with!
My Baby Loves Them,"A great non-wheat option for babies younger than one year.  Very crumbly, so they are not a choking hazard.  Wish we'd found them earlier, as they keep our daughter entertained and happy while we enjoy our dinner."
Toned-down version of a classic,"I am a lover of bold flavors, especially spicy and sour. I was psyched to find a few Tear Jerkers gumballs, individually wrapped, in mixed bags of candy we were handing out to kids in a parade this weekend.  I tried all three ""flavors"" that I found in the bag (red, green, and blue), and found all of them to be disappointing when held up against my memories of being able to barely tolerate them when I was in high school.<br /><br />They are sour, but not ""lock your jaw up"" sour like they used to be. I remember them almost rivaling the sour power of Warheads... and while I still find Warheads to be ridiculous for the first few seconds, these gumballs just don't compare to the ones I remember. Good, not great.<br /><br />The only caveat I would add is that it was not ""Cry Baby"" gumballs, but ""Tear Jerkers Sour Bubble Gum"" printed on the wrappers. They're both manufactured by Tootsie Roll Industries, so they're pretty likely to be the same thing, but I haven't done a side-by-side comparison."
coffee syrup,I did not like the Da Vinci sugar free pumpkin syrup at all.  It leaves a strange after taste and more closely tastes like a fermented fruit flavor.
Love Those Beer Nuts,"For some reason, beer nuts have practically vanished from supermarkets in my area. Our local HARDWARE store sells the smaller party canister Beer Nuts and only the peanut variety. Cashews are incredible and very difficult to stop eating once you've started. I'm glad I did a simple search for Cashew Beer Nuts on Amazon.com,<br />my new source for yummy snacks!."
Vega Links,"For a vegetatian ""hot dog"" these are the best in taste. Some others have a very unpleasant taste, however good for you they are, my only hope is that Amazon continues to carry these and other Worthingtn and Loma Linda products. These are great because you need not freeze or refigerate them. You only need to open the can that will store for a long time on the shelf."
Really good,I've tried this product twice now and I have to concur with the other positive reviews.  It makes me more alert and has a subtle but positive effect on my mood.  It seems too good to be true.
Wonderful Beef Stew by Happy Family,"This Beef Stew is fantastic!  It actually tastes like beef stew, no artificial flavorings or colors.  Everything in it is organic and there is quinoa too.  Babies need to be able to taste what real food tastes like.  This product delivers!  All of the other baby beef stews taste like a mystery and loaded with extra ""stuff"" that babies do not need.  It has great portable packaging for moms on the go.  Great price too!"
i've bought this before,"yes, i have bought this before. i like the smell and detest the bottle design. i do agree with one of the reviewers that the Dove does sell their liquid soaps in pump form in Asian countries and sell the refills for them as well. i would like it if they have that... but i must make due with what i CAN get at this point in time.<br /><br />i decided to redo the way i do my bath routine the way i currently do is so time consuming. it takes almost an hour to take a shower.<br />so i'm on amazon finding things to aid in my new innovated routine.<br /><br />like i said before, i have bought this product in Walmart but only the single bottles or double bottles that happened to be on sale. i love the product it makes me feel soft and silky. the scent is pleasant. not over powering at all. light.<br /><br />i don't buy lotion, they're often heavy and make me feel greasy or they feel weird on my skin. i am of the chocolate complexion so i tend to get extremely ashy because i don't like the way i feel after putting on lotion, so i buy dove body wash, deep moisture. i get clean, moisturized and don't feel greasy after i get out the shower.<br /><br />**EdIt!**<br /><br />i have solved the oddly shaped bottle problem, buy or find one lying around the house, a soap pump for hand soap.<br />i recommend the ones that have had hand soap in them as they are conditioned for everyday use and can hold a thicker capacity soap like this the manufacturer had the bottles made specifically for their product, their product is thick. i've read and heard that the ones you buy empty are for thin lotions and what not.<br /><br />if you use an old soap bottle clean it out first and fill with the Dove soap, and use in the shower, if you can find a 24 oz bottle (maybe from one of doves hair pumps rinsed out,) they're 25oz, big enough to fit all of it and strong enough for thick products such as this. (25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom, anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much, by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it'll be where you want it and you don't come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a Dove Soap Deep Moistruizing Body wash bottle...  XD"
Well...,"Plants came in only 6 days, was VERY happy about that. Packaged well but a tad bit smaller than expected, NOT of fruiting size! The plant is very green, thick and healthy so we don't mind waiting a little longer for fruit."
Must be the PEAS,"Cat do not care for it. I'm having to mix it with California Natural Chicken and Brown rice in order to get rid of it. I'm not going to throw it away it's too bloody expensive. Will not buy again.<br /><br />Any food, dry or canned, that has PEAS in it they won't touch. And these are feral cats. Three live ""in the wild"". You'd think they'd eat anything right? Wrong.<br /><br />I have to say here that I've had cats for 27 yrs now and up until these past few years (say 5) have NEVER had food rejected. NOW that's all I have is food problems. WHAT IS IT?<br /><br />I think it's all the fruits and vegetables, herbs and all the other BS. Flaxseed, soybeans. You ever taste flaxseed  or soybeans EUCK!<br /><br />Even my piggy cat is turning his nose up to all the canned foods listed below. I currently have a new feral that refuses everything but Safeway's Mom-to-Mom Chicken baby food. Below is my running list for him. The wild ferals reject the Wellness grain-free chicken and EVO cat & kitten chicken, Calif. Nat. Chix/rice canned, Deep Water Fish canned and practically everything else on the below list except for the homemade.<br /><br />Chicken livers Steamed and pureed . or raw NO<br />Chicken hearts, Steamed and pureed , combined or separate from livers NO<br />Chicken breast, steamed and pureed NO<br />Chicken thighs saut&eacute;ed in water, pureed NO<br />Beef steak, steamed and pureed, saut&eacute;ed/pureed NO<br />Pork- no one will touch pork<br />Baby food (chix only. will not touch others) - Mom to Mom YES; Beeches NO, Oorganics Not anymore<br />Calif.

For 10 yrs I fed my cats California Natural Chicken and Brown Rice CANNED and DRY.... no problem whatsoever. For the past couple years they will not even go near the canned.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if you see this review repeated for all the above foods. My experience, unfortunately, has been in general the same for all."
Great cereal,"My family--kids and adults--loves this cereal! I had trouble finding it at local stores, so I ordered it online. We're going through it fast so I'm about to order another pack.<br /><br />Not that it really matters, but the actual box cover differs from the picture on Amazon's website. The cereal is the same, though."
"Great packaging, long lived","Great stuff - Tough, durable plastic container, used as frequently as anything else on my spice rack but held up well. No huge surprises in terms of taste, but definitely a handy thing to have around.<br /><br />Minus one star for lacking a clear expiration date (but my jar's at least two years old) and for failing to sell individuals. That whole ""two years old"" thing makes me feel a little ridiculous pricing a four-pack."
LOVE this brand!,"My 11 month old loves this flavor!  I love it, too, since it is healthy and doesn't stain clothing! LOL.<br />Will definitely be buying it again- it's a great deal on Amazon.com, too.  We have the Amazon Prime membership and<br />you can't beat the price, and I LOVE the 2 day free shipping that comes with the Prime membership!<br /><br />Another reviewer said that it gets thick in the fridg- EASY FIX- Just STIR IT before you give it to your baby!<br />I always stir it when I open the jar for the first time and have never had a ""too thick"" problem after the jar has been in the fridge. Remember, like any food product, the liquid separates sometimes and you just have to stir the food.  No big deal.  Problem solved.  If you still have an issue with it, I would recommend adding a few drops of water or formula to the food. Then stir again."
Great food!,"My 9 month old pitt loves this food, it only took him about 3 days to adjust to it. His energy level is great, shiny healthy coat, his allergies seemed to have gotten better. This is 5 star quality food."
Bold Coffee,"I'm partial to a light to medium roast coffee.  This Rainforest Blend is strong and is oddly flavored, in my taste. The way the k-cup smells is the way the coffee tastes. I don't like it.  If you like bold flavors, you may enjoy this."
Great heat and flavor!!,We like chipotle and thought we would give these a try. They exceeded our expectations.These peanuts are very flavorful and yet nicely hot.You get taste first then a snap when the hot kicks into gear. They are hot enough to make your nose run like wasabi but not as hot as say 15 alarm type hot items. My two boys 15 and 9 loved them and were quickly addicted to the one-two punch. Even my twin 6 year old daughters liked them...but they kept their juice handy.<br /> Great for eating alone or to add to other nuts to liven them up.
"Great Flavor great price, great gift","Got this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it! Im finding myself sneaking some and we both look forward to trying the next bag since I signed him up for monthly shippings! Altho I havent figured out how to change the flavors, Im sure its with Amazon and not the Wild Ride company. Wouldnt bother either of us to get the same but would love to try all the flavors. Got a great deal and very happy with the quality and amount! Very tender, great flavor and filling as a snack! Husband is looking forward to baseball season to finally have some great jerky to snack on during the games! Recommend to all and makes a great gift that keeps giving!"
Fan-friggen-tastic,"These are very good.<br />Like salt-and-vinegar potato chips, but more substantial and delicious. The almond gives a nice hint of sweetness under the assault of the vinegar. I've eaten 2/3rds a can at one sitting."
dog does not like it,Bought this for my dog that could stand losing some weight. Rescue dog. Only food I have given her that she does not like. Had to buy canned dog food to mix with it. That is the only way she will eat it. Probably will not be buying this type of food again.
"Cookie ""Duster""","I had a difficult time finding the sanding sugar.  There are no stores in my area that carry it.  I was very surprised to find it on Amazon.  The store I bought it from was quick to deliver and I was very pleased with the price of the product.  I received a generous amount and was able to ""dust"" all my sugar cookies! Thank you!"
Pretty Good,I'm new to the GF diet but I think these are quite delicious and flavorful. The only not great thing is that the seeds get stuck in my teeth. Definitely try them.
Great ginger flavor,"These are the best ginger candies/chews I've ever tried.  The ginger flavor is stronger, and more interesting/complex than that in the more widely-marketed brand, The Ginger People. I've compared them side by side and really find this flavor to be superior. Chimes also has less sugar, which is great if you're sensitive to high sugar foods.  I imagine some people might prefer other brands because they are softer and more sugar-laden.  But if you really like good ginger, try this one!"
Favorite flavors,If you are like me and you have just a few really favorite flavors of coffee this may be the package you are looking for.  Just the ones you like best. Like a greatest hits package with no filler.
why is it wet?,"the salt is wet and i dont like that. it's not dripping or anything, but it's moist and it is clumping. i had to put it in the oven and as i type it's baking to get the moisture out.<br /><br />i did not know that it would be damp.<br /><br />it has a nice flavor, quite salty. if it was not damp/wet, i'd buy it again."
Stupendous,"How convenient it is to have a big stick of pepperoni on hand? Very! Now all I have to do is slice what I want for my pizza, chunk it for a salad or in pasta. It works for everything. Spaghetti sauce gets an extra kick with pepperoni added. I'm still working on things to add it to."
enticing morning brew,"Emeril's Big Easy Bold coffee makes it easier to get out of bed in the morning. I start thinking about having a cup the moment my eyes open and, before I know it, my feet have hit the floor. Later, when I'm ready to go to work, I make another cup to take with me because I prefer its taste to any  coffee I could buy on the way. Big Easy Bold has spoiled me."
Deliciously Crunchy,"GeniSoy makes some of the best Soy Nuts around and these are especially good with a Deep Sea Salted flavor. You can eat them alone as a snack or use them in recipes calling for nuts and peanuts. Perfect to substitute if you have nut and peanut allergies.<br /><br />To make up your own health mixes, stir in pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, cheese snack crackers (Annie's Baked Cheddar Bunnies are fun), sunflower seeds and anything else that gives you a nice mix of sweet, savory and salty.<br /><br />Ingredients: IP roasted soybeans, organic sea salt, organic expeller pressed canola oil.<br /><br />Never overly salted and perfectly delicious!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
Ramen for gluten free me,"I'm very gluten intolerant and am always looking for quick to fix foods that I can eat.  This is made with rice noodles. I love the flavor of the curry one.  I can't always find this in stores, haven't found them at all since I moved, so I'm glad Amazon carries them."
Works every time,"I've made 6-10 batches of bread with this yeast so far.  It's been easy to work with and has resulted in big, beautiful loaves each time.  It's a lot of yeast, so if you're not a high-volume baker you may want to split the order with another family."
"Lipton Cup-a-Soup, Spring Vegetable",Lipton Spring Vegetable is a vegetarian product which fits my dietary needs.  It is tasty and fulfilling on its own and can function as a soup base or addition to other dishes. It adds body and flavor to soups or stews and blends well with mixed vegetables. Very practical!
Kind Gluten Free Bars,I love these bars. I'm on a glutten-free diet and they are both<br />tasty and healthy. I will continue purchasing these bars.
Great chai,I was trying to drink more green tea but found most to be rather tasteless. Then I tried the green chai tea and I love it. It has a richer taste with all the various spices it has blended with the green tea.
Healthiest addition ever,"I absolutely love these hemp seeds. They come vacuum-sealed and I just transfer them to a large freezer bag when I open them, and store them in the freezer.<br /><br />Hemp seeds are a perfect protein, supplying your body with all the essential amino acids. In just 3 tablespoons of these seeds, you're getting 11 grams of protein! They are also super high in other minerals and vitamins, as well as omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />We sprinkle these on just about anything - oatmeal, yogurt, pizza, you name it. I mix them in with all types of food for my now 15 month old son. They are SO good for babies and young children with all the omega-3 fatty acids, protein, minerals.<br /><br />I subscribe to this item and only pay $50 with free shipping - can't beat the price for such a healthy item."
For when I'm going decaf,I like the flavor of this tea.  It is not subtle in any way.  The lemon coupled with ginger provides a very drinkable and somewhat stomach soothing combination.  My little kids think the ginger is a little bit spicy but they will also drink it.
Alright if you are hungry,"first off, used only part of the flavor pouch....love ramen but the flavor dust is a bit much in full force.  I was surprised by the added sugar in the flavor packet.  It is teriyaki after all, but not the right kind of sweetness.  Noodle texture was off, but edable.  i.e. at no time eating it, did I think teriyaki noodles, and I like teriyaki.<br /><br />Ok, so high end it isn't.  It was alright overall, and if you don't think about it too much, its not bad.  The veggies were a bigger surprise, as a lot of small bits went in, but actually had large pieces of green leaf material after cooking.  If using as a starter to a bigger meal, I think I would just start with a ramen pack and build from there.  It seemed to need more water than it called for."
Noticable improvement in dog's coat! Excellent dog food.,"I have 2 weenie dogs. The newest is a long hair. The past 3 before her were all short hair, so I guess I never saw the importance of a really good food for coat purposes before. I tried to buy good food for health purposes only. Well, being short on funds for a while and temporarily taking care of a total of 4 dogs, I switched from Eukanuba (which I thought was really good) to a brand sold at Walmart, that while not the cheapest there, was definitely a lot cheaper. However, we noticed a HUGE difference in all the dogs coats. Especially our long hair. Her hair got realllyyyy thin. You could see her SKIN on some parts. So, I started researching the best brands for improving the coat and found Avoderm. I am sooooo pleased. Her hair not only came back, but it came back thicker, fuller and softer than ever before! We were also having problems with flakiness on the tips of the ears in all the dogs which also went away with the switch. I'm a loyal Avoderm buyer now and searched everywhere and was driving 50 minutes away just to get it after moving to a tiny town in a new state with no large chain pet stores. You can imagine my surprise when I realized I could get it on Amazon, and it was even cheaper than driving to the store. Easier and cheaper!! It's a win win!! This is good stuff!"
Too salty...,"I love the taste of pop-chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.<br />I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.<br /><br />I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok."
read fine print!,"I bought a supply of these ""ginger chews"" to help with nausea during treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. I thought the calories were high and the ""hot"" taste was more like pepper. Looking carefully at the contents, I discovered these chews contain only 8% ginger! The sugar and tapioca (aka manioc root) are what add the carbs. They are tasty, but contain too little ginger for optimal results and taste. Unfortunately, I still have many small boxes of this product. They will make nice stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br />Roman Vanasse, Green Bay, Wisconsin."
Too Expensive,I give it a 3 star just because of the price!!! (trust me its best noodles ever but way too expensive!!!) Awesome product no doubt but this will be the last time i will purchase it from this site. Thank goodness i just discovered a place to get it for HALF the Price... smh  @ veryasia
Works for Our Golden,"I'm very happy with this food. Our Golden Ret was on it a year and her weight is excellent, beautiful coat, and firm stool.<br />I used to get it at our local Petco but they stopped carrying it. It broke my heart. You know how it is when you get something you're happy with and it's no longer available.<br />Anyway, Amazon to the rescue. No additional shipping charge with my Amazon Prime membership. I'll keep our dog on this for another year then switch to the adult formula.<br />Now if I could only get it delivered with groceries from Amazon Fresh :>)"
Fresh & natural,"Great product.  Even my very picky kitty (has digestive problems)liked this flavor.  She always loves salmon-flavored wet food but not usually chicken-flavored wet food, so I was apprehensive about her reaction.  It took her a few days, but she got to like it (not love it).  It looks different from the wet food we're used to, but that's apparently due to the lack of artificial preservatives.  Also, I feel good about buying it since proceeds go to charity."
Chewy and Spicy...yum!,I hate making breakfast so these bars are perfect for winter mornings. Why save the flavor of pumpkin and spice for only the holiday season? These are delicious year round. They do however contain quite a bit of sugar so maybe they should be a treat and not a staple. Either way I'm happy when I eat one because these are a source of Omega-3. I can't see why anyone would say these are bland. They are bursting with flavor. My box says best before OCT 2012 so it is a fresh box. I could see how these would not taste good if they were stale.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
terrific turkey,"we have 3 cats and they all love temptations.  they get all excited whenever we get new flavors such as the turkey,beef,and dairy.  this written part, is for all the flavors you are asking me to review,in fact the beef and dairy are exactly the same review as far as stars. and everything"
Great Tasting Fruit Punch,I saw this on an Amazon advertisement and the soccer ball caught my attention.  Gave it a shot and was very good.  You can really taste the Fruit Punch flavor without it being too sweet.  Having all natural ingredients is also a plus as I'm trying to replace my soda intake with something like this.<br /><br />Also tastes good on the alcohol side.  I'm getting sick of Red Bull and this goes great with vodka.
chestnuts,"We first saw this product in Costco but being Costco was 25 miles away we ordered through Amazon, received the chestnuts the following day,  I eat a package a week.  Love the texture and taste."
Best Green Tea,"This is the best green tea I have had.  The taste is smooth and sweet.  I have a sweet tooth and no sugar needs to be added. I can brew it even in cool water.  To get best benefit of green tea, the second brewing is better."
Overly Receptive Reviews Leads to Dissapointment,"I had just tried the Yogi Rejuvenation which is good.  But this one contains 0 actual tea leaves.  It has that artificial sweenter taste and i found myself wincing after each sip like it was medicine.  Not very enjoyable.  Really bad tasting as well.  Also, returns are not elgible for this item.  I would rather have a stuffy nose than put myself through a cup of this bad, bad tasting concoction of herbs."
great for lunch,I love this soup. It takes a little longer than directions state but it has awesome flavor and is definitely worth the wait!
Top of the line green tea,"My absolutely favorite green tea - at least of those available in tea bags. The sachets are great for larger mugs. I'm certainly no tea expert, but I have tried many, many different brands - usually purchased from the selections of either World Market or Whole Foods - and have yet to beat Two Leaves and a Bud. It's certainly not cheap, and may not be for those of you who need to watch your per-cup budget, but it's worth it to me (especially once I found it in bulk on amazon). I also really like the Mountain High Chai."
Seriously the best black licorice in the world.,"I love the Panda licorice bars because they are one solid piece without ridges or holes.  I can take a small bite and just suck on it for an hour like a lozenge.  Ounce for ounce, these Panda bars last me longer than any other kind of licorice.  Now that I live overseas in a country where black licorice isn't available, I really appreciate that these Panda black licorice bars can last me for such a long time.<br /><br />I've traveled the world, always making it a point to look for my favorite candy wherever I go.  I've tried local licorice from the U.S., Poland, Egypt, and best of all, Finland (where Panda is made).  Seriously, the Finns know how to make good licorice, and Panda is their best.<br /><br />I have loved black licorice since I was a little kid.  I can't remember when I first tried Panda's black licorice, but from the moment I did, it became my very favorite."
Nutrition facts unclear,"I love the taste of the product, and with portion control I do not get any of the gastric side effects. However, I cannot find an area to ask the manufacturer questions, and I am very confused about the nutrition facts of the product. The product states that there are 160 calories and 37 grams of carbohydrates in each serving size. It states the sugars are 0gm but next to the sugar alcohols, it is blank. I was wondering if anyone knows how many sugar alcohols and how many net carbs are in this product? Does your body process all 160 calories and 37 grams of carbohydates that are in the product, or are you able to eliminate some of the carbohydrates from your daily carb intake (as you would do with fiber since its undigestible?) Thanks,"
Great product,"This popcorn is the real deal. Pop a bag, sit back in your easy chair, watch a movie and you will think you are in a theater."
Gross!! Don't waste your money!,"I feel for all the hype on these noodles.  I bought the six pack of the angel hair noodles.  I followed directions on the package and then served them in my stir fry as my noodles.  They smell like fish, and have a texture like worms.  It is the most horrible thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Now I have five left and can't return these things.  I may try putting them outside to see if the birds or raccoons will eat them."
WOW This is CHOCOLATE...,"Made a batch of chocolate ice cream and it was Great.  Rich, deep chocolate flavor.  If it works this well in ice cream it will be wonderful in normal baked goods.  No more melting other chocolate for me."
Flavoring,I've been using LorAnn products for years. They are the best when it comes to making flavoring for candy.
Too thin...and a quick chew.,"A bit of disappointment in this bully stick due to lack of thickness.  Product Description is: 12"" Select Bully Sticks - Pkg of 50. Select Bully Sticks are thicker and heavier than standard Bully Sticks.<br /><br />My 9 month golden retriever, who has spent a day or more on a competitor's 0.75"" diameter bully sticks, tore through the first K-nine Kountry stick in ~15 minutes.  They are obviously very tasty to the dog, but they stunk up the house upon opening the bag (which we now keep out in the garage)<br /><br />Either K-nine Kountry sent me the wrong product or my expectations are out of whack.  A majority of the sticks average 3/8"" or less in diameter.  I counted 6 of the 50 sticks that were 1/2"" to 3/4"" in diameter.  Personally, I can't imagine a bully stick getting any thinner than a majority of what I received, so the idea that they are ""Select"" is what concerns me."
Good light gluten free cracker,I like all the Mary's Gone Cracker's items but this is my favorite.  They are good alone or with salsa.  My wife likes to put peanut butter on them.
good sub for jelly,I don't really like walden farms products but this one is pretty good. Its very similar to jelly.
The Best Treat,"This has been such a joy in my life.  I am a diabetic and it is so nice to have some decaf, sugar free coffee when I want it.  This makes it easy for all my guests to have a choice of their regular coffee or General Food International Coffee.  Love it"
Oh crispy rice...,"I eat this stuff all the time, usually plain & dry. It's quite simple but it tastes great! It is very, very light though, so don't buy it expecting a filling breakfast cereal."
Best coffee ever!,"This is by far my favorite coffee.  I used it continuously when living in Europe and am so glad to have found it on Amazon at a reasonable price.<br /><br />It is strong but very mellow.  No bitter aftertaste, and makes the first cup of coffee worthwhile getting up for.<br /><br />Please continue to make favorable price offers on this item and I promise I will continue ordering."
One Love Better Than It Smells,"One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost ""muddy"" odor. By ""muddy,"" I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you're looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone. A nice organic blend."
Not too weak Not to Strong - good cup of coffee,"This coffee saved the Tassimo machine from being returned.  I had a Keurig for years and to the most part it worked pretty well but there were two issues.  With all the flavors available I ended up using just one, Donut Shop Coffee by Coffee People which I liked.  However, the Keurig machine I have only has one brew size and I would end up using 2-3 K-cups a day to get a nice big cup of coffee in the morning.  The other issue was it just did not brew really hot coffee.<br /><br />Enter the Tassimo - I was really nervous about the limited selection of coffee available but I figured if I could find one I like it would be a good solutions especially since I  like the fact that on occasion I can make a cappuccino or other fancy drink.  The Starbucks coffee is just too strong so I tried the Maxwell House which was just OK.  I then tried the Gevalia Large Morning Roast and I hit the jackpot.  It as a good large serving so I was only using one t-disc.  It was HOT and it had a nice strong (by my taste) non-bitter flavor.  It reminds me of what I got in Italy when I asked for american brewed coffee."
Delicious and not bad for you,"I don't like sweet potatoes but I do like sweet potato fries.  I love these Popchips Sweet Potato Chips, they are very tasty.  There isn't a lot of salt, fat, or carbs.  My only complaint is each bag only contains .8 ounces, but I guess they wanted the bag to be exactly 100 calories.<br /><br />The rest of the Popchips line is great too.  Not fried or baked, and reasonably healthy."
packaging confuses,"I thought I was ordering authentic green tea, so when I got the green tea and it tasted like lemon and other sweet things and anything but green tea, I was very disappointed. Even from the name ""antioxidant"" green tea, I wouldn't normally expect such a fruit-flavored beverage. Frustrating. Having said that, I do enjoy Celestial Seasonings Authentic Green Tea as one of the most drinkable low-priced greens, and I also appreciate their eco-friendly packaging. (And, really, it was my mistake in ordering the wrong tea, however I think their packaging or description maybe could be clearer about the differences.)"
The BEST,"My family in Ireland always eats this oatmeal. It is very creamy and never lumpy. Really hits the spot on cold mornings. Sometimes I add raisins, cinnamon, brown sugar. It is wonderful and healthy too."
air planter,"I got this plant as a gift 2 years ago.  I must admit I did not believe that a plant would thrive without soil or immersed in water, but<br />this plant has done great.  it continues to thrive on my kitchen windowsill.  Buy it and you wont be sorry."
Really Long Lasting Gum - Highly Recommended,"This is seriously long lasting gum with a great peppermint flavor and good chewing consistency. I am normally very critical of gums but this is one of the best, by far.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
ALWAYS A STANDARD IN MY KITCHEN. BEST FOR HOT CURRY!,COCONUT IS GO0D FOR SO MANY THINGS. THIS IS ORGANIC AND I FEEL BETTER SERVING IT THAN OTHER COCONUT MILKS.
Great mix!,This Crazy cups Travel the world pack contains a great variety of items! We like to have this on hand at work to offer to our clients. There is something for everyone! My personal favorite is the french vanilla cappuccino.
Delicious!,"The Megafudge Chips Ahoy Gooey cookie is delicious! It is soft and sweet, and just the right amount of gooey center.<br />You definitely can't eat just a few of these. Pour yourself a cold glass of milk and get a stack of these cookies. They are heavenly."
Awesome healthIER snack option!,"I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind."
"Sorry it's taken me so long to do a review, but I concur","I concur with everyone else exactly. Great product; greatly packaged; wonderful seller. I appreciate them and what they do for us and their integrity.<br /><br />I bought these to make Rejuvelac and I couldn't be happier and so I highly recommend.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you!"
Fun for a party,"This is so much fun to use.  Please just taste small amounts of the sour bitter stuff or you will tear up your stomach.  I read the reviews by people who over indulged and took the warnings seriously.  Imagine eating grapefruit, orange, lemon and lime skin with no bitterness.  You can drink vinegar.  Amazing."
Amazing!,"I have been looking for a great tasting, ready-to-drink protein supplement that does not contain any artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners give me a headache, I do not like the way they taste and they are horrible for you. This product tastes great, has 16 grams of whey protein and many additional vitamins, minerals and antioxidants from organic sources. I usually make a whey protein smoothy post work-out with unflavored whey (without all the added chemicals), but Orgain is great if you do not have time or are just looking for a meal replacement. The only con is that it is a little on the pricey side and is hard to find in stores, but if you look at all the ingredients, I think it is worth it."
DELICIOUS,"I love this stuff.  Delicious.  You could definitely get more than 1 gallon out of each of these bags.  I use them with a<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J5FN48"">Mr. Coffee TM70 3-Quart Iced Tea Maker</a>, alternating between the Passion tea and regular <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00286KM2A"">Lipton Iced Tea, 48-Count Gallon SizeTea Bags</a> (which I get at Costco)."
Great Dental Workout for Your Dog,"Great way to give your dog a healthy dental workout every day.  Every morning our dogs are waking us up to start their day with a HEXtra Chew, they even forgo eating to have their chew first thing in the morning.  We find that their teeth and breath are cleaner and fresher then every before and they each go to their own rug to enjoy their morning chew much like we enjoy our first cup of coffee in a favorite chair."
My new favorite!,This is my new favorite K-cup.  It's great to get me going in the morning and doesn't wilt under all the flavored creamer that I like to add.  Yum!
Very Durable,"This is a great toy for heavy chewers. I have a pit bull mix who has played with this toy for over a month now, and it is still in good condition. I didn't see how this large plastic object would be appealing to my dog, so I had peanut butter ready just in case. However, I didn't need it, as he chewed on it for a good hour the first time I gave it to him. He still chews on it from time to time, and aside from small particles that he chews off, the whole toy is still intact. I highly recommend this toy. I also suggest taking it away from your dog for a period of time so that when you give it back to him, he will still be excited to play with it."
No Happy,After waiting 40 days I still have not received this product and I have now missed Christmas. Not enough staff was the reason for the delay. Never again Amazon!
Buyer Beware!,"I was in a hurry and looking to re-order the gallon bottle of O'Dells which was out of stock. I noticed this, which appears to be the same as O'Dells and didn't read closely that it was 16 ounces not 128 ounces due to the price being relatively close. Was shocked when it got here to discover it was only 16 ounces. Price comparison...O'Dells 128 ounces $17.99 (.14 per ounce) Paragon 16 ounce $12.63 (.78 per ounce). Run away from this item quickly. If O'Dells is unavailable, get the Wabash Valley Farms instead!"
hard and dry cookies,"These Taffy cookies are similar in flavor to the Tea cookies.The Tea cookies have a nice sandwich cookie crumble and great flavor.These Taffy cookies were hard,dry,and unpleasant to eat.The expiration dates were fine-so is this just the way these cookies are,or did I get a bad batch?I will not be ordering again."
Anyone Else Get a Burning Sensation?,"I just ordered this product from Amazon, and I very much like the taste.  But as soon as I swallow the olive oil I - and others in my family - detect a burning sensation on the back of my throat.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Is this likely a production defect with my specific bottle, or is it a characteristic of the product itself?  I have never had any other olive oil do this."
Maytag Blue Cheese,We sent this to my wife's cousin & she was absolutely delighted!  She had just finished the last pound we sent her.  Thank you.
Grandchildren love these,My two grandchildren both have severe food allgeries. But the PopChip salt and pepper chips are great for them and they both love the taste.
"Works great and leaves clean, fresh smell","I love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel smooth and clean, plus no flaking or scalp itch. Some dandruff shampoos have a horrible odor, and then some shampoos (and soaps) have such a strong perfume smell that I don't like using them. This has a subtle, yet clean and fresh aroma. I highly recommend!"
My toddler loves these still!,"I started using these when my son was about 10 months old and stuck with them because they're organic, they have actual apples in them (amazing!) and HE LOVES THEM! Now that he's 2, he still asks for them. Who am I to argue?"
Really Good and Gluten Free,Kind Bars come in many flavors but this is my favorite. It allows you to have something made from healthy and organic ingredients that still seems like having a candy bar-just healthy. Received my last shipment and my bars were stale/hard as a rock. Never had this happen before.
"""THE"" #1 Drink","I have been a devoted Kombucha Wonder Drink consumer for 10 years. The first time I had a sip was at a health foods store in Jackson Hole, and I had to have more. If you are hesitant about trying it, jump on in to the Kombucha club. You will enjoy every sip!"
"""Made"" in the US does NOT mean there are no ingredients from China","While it says made in the USA, nowhere on the package or their webpage does it say if they get ingredients from China.<br /><br />Del Monte also makes:<br /><br />They included Waggin' Train and Canyon Creek Ranch brands produced by Nestle Purina PetCare Co., and Milo's Kitchen Home-style Dog Treats, ****** produced by the Del Monte Corp.*********<br /><br />Import data compiled by the firm ImportGenius showed that Waggin' Train and Canyon Creek Ranch treats are produced and supplied by JOC Great Wall Corp. Ltd. of Nanjing, China.<br /><br />Read Article  [...]<br /><br />Del Monte, sited in the above article also makes this Jerky Treat.<br /><br />I have fed this treat to my dogs and after 1/2 strip fed 2 days in a row, they started throwing up.  This was the reason I started doing some searching and found that article above."
Worth the search!,"Why in the world is such a delicious product so very hard to find?!  I first had this while on vacation in Costa Rica.  We brought home several bottles of it and and have really stretched to make it last, because we couldn't find it in any stores here in the U.S.  The flavors are unique and go well with anything you might want to marinate and grill...shrimp, chicken, beef, pork.  It is even tasty as a condiment, used like A-1 or Heinz 57.  A little goes a long way, so don't hesitate to give this great product a try.  And let's work on getting this in the stores so we can all buy it like ketchup, mayonaise, and mustard!!"
Marley Coffee One Love,"Using it as intended with a single serve pod brewer, I found it to be weak but I liked the smell so much I wanted to find another way to try it. I also have a Breville single serve coffeemaker so I decided to brew one by cutting open the pod and using my k-cup. I got a great tasting, strong cup of coffee (very strong, the kind my grandparents always used to say would ""put hair on your chest"").  I just ordered grounds because I really enjoyed the strength and taste of this coffee.  The pods weren't for me, but the coffee was."
Indoor use only?,"This electric fence kit for pets and small animals <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VXYV6K"">Havahart SS-750RPX AC-Powered Electric Fence Kit for Pets and Small Animals 1-Mile Range</a> comes with 100 feet of wire and ten posts - only enough for a single wire 25' X 20' area, though the kit says it has a 1-mile range. We bought extra wire <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK0334"">Baygard Electric Fence 14 Gauge Aluminum Wire - 164 Feet #00533</a>and insulators<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BO0Y1K"">Zareba Electric Fence Yellow Economy Round-Post Insulator - 25 Pack SF25RP</a>. We needed more posts so we used 1/4"" diameter lengths of rebar with the extra insulators. After we had all the posts and wire installed and were ready to hook up and test the fence, we discovered this in the AC power unit instructions: FOR INDOOR USE ONLY. This unit is attached to the bare wire that delivers the shock, so it's impossible to keep it indoors. This product is obviously intended to be used OUTDOORS. My husband built a wooden, water-tight box to contain it. It's plugged into an outdoor GFI (ground frequency interruptor) outlet. If it bothers you to have to build or buy a watertight box to use a fence intended but not constructed or insulated for outdoor use, do not buy this product. We are using a double wire, 6 inches and 18 inches off the ground, to keep raccoons from stealing all our corn from our garden, and it's working."
Only ice tea I will drink now.,I have tried a number of green teas and this is my favorite by far.  It has wonderful flavors that aren't over powering and I add a little honey to it to make it sweet.  I love it.  Don't stop making it!!!
My Puppy LOVES these!,"No matter the flavor, my puppy loves Zuke's.  A little pricy, but I like her to have healthier treats.  They are pretty strong smelling, so I can only assume they taste pretty good."
Fantastic!!!,The kids both love these.  They are even better than the origical Rice Krispies.  They are a great price too when you buy them in a pack of 4!
"Super taste sensation, not too hot, but spicy enough for children to crave","If you cannot tolerate extremely hot spicy chips, but like some zing with the crunch then these chips are made for your enjoyment. I purchased these around the holidays and they were truly enjoyed by many guests. Yes, I will be purchasing these chips again because they are really good for you being organic, and affordable."
Pretty plant,"I ordered 2 of these.  They arrived 4 days after I placed the order, which is the fastest I've ever received anything (that was with standard shipping as well).  I should have paid more attention to the pot the seller was sending them in.  It's nothing more than a flimsy container.  I will be going to the store to buy new pots for them today.  The plants arrived in great condition, they look awesome.  I would totally order this item again."
Love love love it,When i took this out my puppy couldn't wait to get into it.  I put the treats in and he went to town.  One of the best toys i've gotten him ever.
Yummmm!,"I bought one of these in our hospital cafeteria, and really enjoyed it.  I've been looking for a snack bar high in protein, low in fat, that tastes good.  Not an easy feat! It really satisfies the sweet tooth I get after lunch. Coffee and chocolate - a delicious combo!"
Mediocre,"The downfall of these cookies are not the way they taste, but the way they are advertised. From the packaging, I expected a chewy cookie with a soft and, to use Nabisco's word, ""gooey"" chocolate center. Unfortunately, the cookies failed to meet my expectations.<br /><br />The actual cookie part was similar to what I expected. The outer portion tastes just like the normal chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies. However, I would not describe the center as gooey. Instead the chocolate center was closer to the consistency of chocolate that is just beginning to melt.<br /><br />While I would not say these cookies were necessarily bad, I certainly would not pick them over regular chewy Chips Ahoy!"
Fried Rice,Tasty but you need to alter the amount of water and microwave times. You also need to add meat to it to make it more like Chinese take out.
Can't Tell the Difference,I wondered if there would be a big difference between regular Splenda and Splenda with Fiber.  I tried Splenda with Fiber in both hot and cold beverages.  It dissolved just fine in both.  There was no difference in taste.  The package is slightly larger and a little heaver.  The fiber appears to be from corn so should not cause any problems.  One gram of fiber is not a lot so unless you use a lot of Splenda you will not get that much of a fiber boost but will get some.  All in all I liked the product.  I did not like the price but hopefully that will come down.
Messy,"I got these to try with my 6 month old son - YIKES! It was a watery disaster. It sure tasted good, but he hardly got any in his mouth because it was like feeding him soup."
Lousy marinade.,"Pretty good and inexpensive steak sauce.<br /><br />Effective marinades have to have a significant acid content, typically vinegar in order to tenderize/break down the meat. This mix doesnt qualify, and you can leave your steak floating in this stuff for 3 days and it will taste the same off the grill as if you had let it soak for 3 minutes. 2 Forks"
WAKE UP,"This product works if you need some instant motivation, whether or not your sleep deprived."
Great!,After listening to David Wolfe I decided to try hemp protein in our breakfast smoothies. I was not sure if we would like it since I was told it can be a little grassy tasting. But this hemp protein is great. It mixes really well into our fruit smooties in the morning and keeps us feeling satisfied until lunch!
"Should be called ""Salteye Salmon""",The fish is ok but the sodium level is very high so you taste mostly salt. My suggestion is to order a sockeye product with no salt added such as Golden Crown and then you can always add seasoning to suit your own taste.
"Perfect snack, perfect size!","I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips, and are amazingly good, and the fat is the good kind, and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.<br /><br />I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store), but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1,200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach, but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal, but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!"
"These are good.  Very, very good.","I don't mean ""good for a gluten free cookie"", or ""almost like a normal cookie"".  No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me."
Mother To Be Tea,"Tastes great, smells great, good nutritional value.  Also like little quotes attached to tea bags, some are very inspirational.  GREAT value from Amazon, when you buy in a large pack of 6 through Prime - cheaper than other web sites out there."
Yum Yum!,We had to switch to grain-free treats once we found out our 10 year old Pit-mix had MCT cancer grade 3. He LOVES these and we are so happy to find grain-free treats that are so nutritional and tasty for my pooch.
The Best!,My Beagle was recently diagnosed with epilespy and has to take medication twice a day.  Pill pockets make it so easy - she hears me opening the package and comes running!  Thank you Greenies!
Well...,"They taste just like grandmas. Actually, the flavor varies from person to person, but I think they're wonderful. A must buy!"
YUM,So very very good. Didnt know what i was getting into- I've had the salty seaweed snacks in the past and enjoyed them; but this was much better. will be ordering more!
"Yes, it is edible but healthy??","Seriously?? By whose standards??<br /><br />Since when are wheat starch, glycerin, cellulose, potato starch, bacon flavor (?what does this mean?) healthy?<br /><br />I bought this thinking it would last a few hours or days but my dog just gobbled it up in minutes.<br /><br />I love the nylabone chew products but I don't recommend these unless you have very large dogs that can eat them as treats."
Darned good for a packaged cookie,"Unlike some of the other reviewers here, our packages of cookies arrived intact, sometimes even overly packaged in that unique-to-Amazon way.  Once we got the cookie packages out of the huge outer box, pushing aside all the bags of air, and then grabbing the inner box (what would be shipped to a supermarket), we found that we had some darned tasty cookies.  Real chocolate chips and a generous amount per cookie, enough to say that it would be tough to take a bite of cokie without getting a chip.  The batter holding things together was good, without nuts or any strong flavoring that would keep it from overpowering the taste of the chocolate.  Nicely crunchy,  as is normal for box cookies.  No one will ever mistake these for homemade, but they are pretty good for packaged cookies."
not what I expected,"I love popcorn especially theater flavor, purchase 2 boxes, one tasted exactly as a theater flavor the other ox do not know if it was old popcorn or ?? did not taste as theater popcorn, no salt flavor :( happy with one box, unhappy with 2nd box. Unable to tell if I would purchase this product again."
Great snack for kids,"I needed something to provide for my kid's snack at school (the parents take turns)... I like these because they are packaged two crackers to a pack, so there's not much waste (as long as you recycle the wrappers).  If you give a kid a stack of crackers, they may not eat them all, but here, they will eat the two, and ask for more if they want.  And the price turned out to be equal to buying a big box of crackers that were NOT individually wrapped.  Nice buy."
Ours dogs' favorite treat!,"We have 3 Jack Russel Terriers and they LOVE these Dingo mini bones.  They love to chew on them and as a result have very clean teeth--all 3 of them.<br /><br />I usually buy the 14-count bag at a local store, but this 21-count value bag is an excellent value."
big european coffee,"is what my husband said this coffee reminds him of.  He likes a mid (not strong) taste.  I don't drink coffee hot. My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it."
Jelly Belly Buttered Popcorn Jelly Beans,These are the BEST!!! If you like popcorn and jelly beans this is the snack for you!!! Makes a great gift for anyone who loves jellybeans/popcorn. I will be ordering more in the future.
Love these bars!,These are the best.  I use them as a meal on the go.  The Protien is high and they are yummy.<br />it is my go to dessert as well.
Pretty good,"Pepper adds a nice kick to beef jerky, and Jack Link makes a nice line of beef jerky. Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste. Yum."
great flavor,i buy allot of these soups and enjoy all the different flavors i can not find in my local store will buy more
Chicken Broth,"I used this one time when my husband was in the hospital and I had a bad cough, the nurse said it would help and it did. I have been looking for it ever since. I love this stuff."
Great product,"My dog loves this jerkey and since he needs glucosamine, it's an easy way to give him some."
Cat's favorite,These treats are my picky cat's favorite.  I've tried about 8 different brands in the past and these are always the preferred kind.  Highly recommended!
Top notch snack!,"In my search for healthy snacks I found this item: Organic, high in fiber, low in fat and they use sea salt. They sound like they should be boring, but they are just as good if not better than any pretzel out there.<br />I can eat 20 of them for only 2 points on my Weight Watchers program and that is a whole lot more than other snacks. They're very filling with a piece of cheese or two which is extremely important when watching what you are eatting!<br />I highly recommend them to anyone!"
So Good!,"If you are a licorice lover and if you like caramel, this is for you! I had never seen this combination until I came across them at another website while placing an order for something else there.  I ordered a tin and fell in love with them immediately.  Of course, when I went back for more, they were no longer available.  No worries, as usual, Amazon came through and for a better price!  Although it sounds unusual, and although they don't have a strong caramel flavor, the combination works well. Reminds me of my favorites in the Allsorts packages, those square ones that are coated with pink, white or orange. Now I don't have to buy the assortment just to get those few of my favorites, I can get these by the pound.  I definitely recommend trying these, you can keep them all for yourself (because you really will eat them faster than you think) or give some to friends in a pretty jar, they are really unique!"
"Fragrant, flavorful, distinct tea","Dragon Eye Oolong tea is fragrant and flavorful. It has hints of fruit and a smooth flavor. It holds up well even if you brew it with water that is too hot. (Other Oolong teas often taste ""burnt"" if the water is still boiling or is otherwise too hot for that particular tea. Not so with this one, from my experience.)  This is the same ""Dragon Eye Oolong"" tea served at P.F. Chang's restaurant if you want to sample it before buying it. It's great tea, and very distinct."
My super picky puppy LOVES it!,"I have a super picky Cavalier King Charles puppy who refuses to eat dry food, and even some wet food. Generally she has to be coaxed to eat her meals. We had her on an expensive brand of canned food, which she mostly liked, but in an effort to save some money, I switched her to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Puppy canned food. SHE LOVES IT. I do not have to even try to get her to eat- she devours it the minute I put the bowl down. It is still a very ""healthy"" food, and it saves me $15 every time I order! Highly recommend, super, super happy!!"
Why on earth do such wonderful products vanish from the market?,"These are my favorite crackers ever, delicious, satisfying, not too salty but plenty flavorful. Why are they disappearing from every store??"
Dog loved it,"Our dog, like the other reviewers, goes through raw hides very quickly.  This one lasted several weeks!!!<br /><br />At first it took Carly (our dog) a bit to get used to it because shes used to the rawhide rolls, but once she was able to make a dent in it, she loved it.<br /><br />Will be purchaseing more."
flying noodle delivers for me,"I've been buying Flying Noodle gift packs to send to my US family members for years and they consistently get high marks from my family. They are particularly good for busy, working parents who welcome an easy meal option via the Pasta Clubs. I have had consistently good service from the company -- although I wish I could use my overseas credit card directly off their store! But you can buy them via Amazon, so that's OK."
Gunpowder tea tastes like gunpowder...who knew,"This is the worst tasting tea I have ever tasted.  I am a tea lover and have tried many, many different teas but this is the absolute worst."
Tasty and Fast,Product tastes great and is in good shape. Only took 8 days from the States to my FOB in Afghanistan. That's really fast.
good chocolate fix,I really enjoy this added to coffee for a mocha flavor.  Dissolves better than other fat free hot chocolate mixes.
a darn good pitcher of tea,I have been making black tea in my bodum iced tea pitcher and wanted to try a nice loose green. This one works perfectly. It has a mild taste that is very fresh.
"Great savings, Great taste","I just love this cereal and even better is the fact it is sooo good for you!  It does come in a single large plastic bag inside a cardboard box, so invest in some good (large) storage containers, but it is definitely worth it given the savings by buying in bulk.  This is my breakfast every single morning, makes me feel great and starts my day off right just knowing how healthy it is!"
Great Mix,This is just what I wanted and it's so hard to find in stores.  Low Carb and great taste.
the only peanut butter we eat!,"My kids eat LOTS of peanut butter! After finding out how much hydrogenized fat is ADDED to regular peanut butter, I quickly switched to Smuckers. We eat it so fast, that we only need to stir it after the jar is opened for the first time (I buy 2 jars a week). My whole family loves the taste of it, and it makes the BEST peanut butter cookies EVER!!!!!!!!"
"Very nice chip, even better ingredients.","A good chip, though some folks might be put off. The olive flavor comes from real olives put into the mix. So this means some chips are -Olive- flavor, and some are just a hint of olive flavor.<br /><br />Personally, this was a sizable plus. Not a every tidbit crunched is the same kind of flavor chip.  If you need something more standardized in the way of flavor you're going to want to look elsewhere.  I liked these better than the multigrain to be sure. Still only 4-stars because it didn't -wow- me the way I want a 5-star product to reflect in my reviews. The smaller chip size should not fool you because it's still sold by weight.<br /><br />It arrived nicely packaged from Amazon,  I did not have a bag of crumbs but intact chips. Something of a plus with products like this.<br /><br />To sum up. Wonderful flavor overall, but don't expect every chip to taste the same."
One Of A Kind,"Palouse Brand Lentils are the best lentils I have ever had.  These lentils hold their shape and texture, they are tender, and the taste is beyond compare. They are great is soups, salads, chilli, you name it. This company produces a lentil that is a true connoisseur's delight and well worth the dollars.  ""Palouse Brand"" is delivering on their promise of an outstanding product!"
GREAT SNACK,"This is one of the best type of snacks I have ever had. They are very addictive. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LZVYA4"">Brookside Dark Chocolate Goji Raspberry 2 lb bag</a>Dark Chocolate it is VERY good for you."
WORKS WELL,"The uninformed human who gave this a 1 star is plain wrong. This stuff works well, I concur with the other 5 star reviews."
Good Quality & Good Service,"I bought Himalayan Organic Salt twice. Each time, quality was really good and service was fast and courteous (The Spice Lab's). I will buy it again."
Best gluten free pancake mix around!,This is the best gluten free pancake mix!!!!!!!!!!!! I have tried  5 or 6 and this one is hands down the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love this tea!,"This is one of my favorite teas.  This is 1/2 the cost of my grocery store, and since the bags are individually wrapped, freshness is not an issue."
1 Star may be generous...,"I'm not a Jerky expert or anything like some of the reviews here. But I've had a few different brands, some the national brands and some smaller ones. I'd have to say this is a bit below average. It was slightly spicy but not terribly tasty and the texture wasn't that good. I didn't get the feeling I was eating quality meat.<br /><br />So why 1 star? Easy. Within 48 hours of opening it I was greeted with bluish white mold covering about 5 or 6 pieces. I'm sure by tomorrow it will be more but it's now in the trash. I don't even know how that happens"
Just OK,This coffee was bitter for my taste and not the strongest coffee either.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that it was the worst coffee I've ever had....but far from<br /><br />the deep rich robust coffee I am used to.
Delicious! And better value than the six-pack of full sized bars,"For those of you not familiar with the cherry ripe, the filling is a dried and slightly candied mince of cherries and coconut. This is coated with a thin outer layer of dark chocolate. They are extremely popular in Australia, where I live, and are in fact one of the classic candy bars we all grew up with. These things are delicious, so if they don't sell them where you are and you have a yen to try another culture's junk food, let me say cherry ripes are a pretty good choice.<br /><br />Unusually, on a per gram basis I'm pretty sure this bag of ""fun sized"" bars offers better value than the only other way I can see of buying cherry ripes on amazon - the six pack of full sized bars. That works out at over $3.32 a bar. But hey, amazon's prices do fluctuate considerably over time, so it might be worth your while to check my figures. They may well be out of date by the time you're reading this.<br /><br />Theo."
best treat,"My dogs love these treats! When my dogs wake up in the morning thats the first thing they want to eat! Especially my dog Luna cries for one. When I say greenie, she immediately runs downstairs and sit right in front of the pantry for one. I highly recommend these treats!"
Best mix or for use in from-scratch recipes.,"Nothing I have tried compares in flavor, texture or ease of use. A must for everyone eating gluten free.<br />The recipe on the back for scones is so delicious it will make you cry. Even better than the Whole Foods Orange Cranberry Scones, my prior favorite."
Add some heat with not so much effect on the flavor,"I discovered these in a restaurant, or actually several restaurants in the same area, although none would say where they got the chilis.  One finally brought the jar out.  They are pretty hot and great in soups and pasta.  They don't change the flavor as much as the vinegar based sauces which is the best feature.  There are times when the vinegar taste is ok, but times when it doesn't work, so these fit right in.  You do have to tear them apart to disperse through the dish, but they're pretty soft.  I guess they could be added while cooking, but I've never tried them that way."
Great rawhide sticks,"I soak them in water, then cut them up for my little Yorkies.  I have left one big one around and they drag it around, it is pretty funny.  I recommend them for any size dog."
Arrived smelling strongly rancid,"This cereal smelled strongly or turpentine or chemical, which indicates that the flax seed content has gone rancid. It is likely due to heat during storage or shipment to us. We had to throw it out. It was a waste of money."
"Beautiful fragrance, Wonderful flavor",I really love this tea!  The fragrance is strong and beautiful. The tea itself is a flavorful medium bodied tea.  While deep in flavor it isn't overpowering.  This is definitely a great tea!
Wonderfully declicious!!,"This is another Wabash Valley popcorn that pops up small, but is absolutely delicious!! Very few kernels are left unpopped in my Whirly Pop. I will buy this one again for sure!"
Was disappointed that sell date was in 8/10...,when I bought the product in almost mid-July.  I got it quickly enough but was not happy that I had less than a month to use a case!  There was no indication of sell date infomation in the procuct description.
Money Tree,"Money tree arrived quickly, initially had a few holes in some of the leaves, but thanks to the great instructions on how to care for the tree it has been thriving. Very happy!"
My dog's liked it but wanted some variety,I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it.  All 3 of my dogs (2 Jack Russells and 1 dachshund) enjoy Newman's Own Dog Food and I liked knowing it was organic.  The kibbles are a perfect size for easy chewing.  My dogs enjoyed Newman's Own for about 3 months but then only nibbled on it so I decided to alternate it each month with another dog food to give my dogs some variety.
Great Green Tea!,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
GREAT PIMENTO STUFFED QUEEN OLIVES,"I LOVE OLIVES, but I never thought I'd find these tasty morsels at Amazon. They are really good and have the perfect tecture I crave.I hardly ever go to my local store anymore thanks to Amazon delivering all my food needs to my door.These olives came with SUPER SAVER and were less expensive then most stores. If you love green olives you must try these :-)"
Packaging make things easy,"I really love the goat milk powders from Meyenberg. Their website said these are healthier and non-BGH contaminated. It does not have all that strong flavor of goat cheese. The individual packaging really make things easy. Now I can just use one pack without worrying how to keep the rest in the can. However, the description of the product is very confusing.<br /><br />""Pack of twelve, 4-ounce each (total of 36 ounces)""<br /><br />Come on, people, I am not sure if I am smarter than a 5th grader, but a simple math like that? That's not even 5th grade. Besides, the Chinese make a small durable device called the ""calculator"", which is also available on amazon.com."
Multi Grain Chips good!,"These chips are very good in taste and with more than the usual grams of fiber, a good choice.  They came very fresh and in good shape--no crushed bags."
"Can you say ""diarrhea""?",It didn't take very long either. Not fun to come home to.<br /><br />The dogs liked them though.
could be better,"I'm used to going to Starbucks for vanilla lattes and I was hoping this coffee would have a sweet vanilla flavor to it.  Although I'm glad to be contributing to buying Starbucks products, this coffee flavor is a let-down.  If there is a hint of vanilla flavoring to it, it's extremely subtle and I was unable to notice it.  If you buy this and you're looking for it to have a sweet vanilla flavor, I would recommend buying a syrup to add to the coffee."
Why Did AMAZON Drop this Product from Subscription Status,The MAXWELL HOUSE DECAF is GREAT and the only decaf we like and with the ease of the subscription service was ideal for us srs.  SO AMAZON drops it from subscription status ???????
The whole family LOVES these snack crisps! Healthy too!,"These fruit crisps are WONDERFUL! A whole pear in one little bag - and a quick and easy snack.  This is a great way to get that ""crunch"" without potato chips or other unhealthy snacks!  My only problem is that I want to eat more than one bag at a time - that can get a little pricy!<br /><br />Great item!"
Newman's Own Salted Stick Pretzels,"These are the best pretzels on the market today. We have been acquiring them for quite some time. They are crunchy, just the right about of salt and package size. However the most important attribute is their profits are provided to a charitable causes."
A Gadget That Actually Works,"I first had the Vinturi demonstrated to me at a wine conference. The demonstrator poured two glasses of wine - one through the Vinturi, the other directly into a glass. You could definitely taste the taste improvement in the wine poured through the Vinturi. The stand makes the Vinturi easier to use and looks great on the counter. I am also glad to see that they have added a filter to catch any sediment in the bottle."
picture of the package of the dog chew is not what I recieved,"If you open the link to the Smartbones you will see that it shows a picture of a package containing a 3-pack of dog chews.  I did not get this bag, I recieved a single dog chew.  I was under the impression by looking at the description on the bag I was getting a single pkg of 3, Not just 1 dog chew.  This made these quite expensive and I ordered two :-("
Way too sour!,"Given the great reviews for these, I took the chance and ordered some.  I love sour fruit snacks and so do my three kids so I was excited to get these.  As it turns out, they are way too sour for everyone.  Even my son who loves sour candies wouldn't eat these.  If you'd prefer to have a more natural, real-fruit tasting snack then I'd look somewhere else."
Please in a Pod,"Some may find it a bit pricey if you calculate the cost by the pound but the quality and convenience is there.  Senseo offers a variety of flavors and one standard decaf.  They are packaged well and easy to use.  For ease of use and taste I would stick with these. Also, they can be used in any single serve coffee maker that accepts pods."
Loves but didn't last,We have a golden doodle who is a strong chewer. His nylabones usually last but he chewed this one in half in about a week. He absolutely loves this toy though. It is his favorite even a month later when he only has a part of it left. If he wasn't such a strong chewer I would definitely get this toy again.
Delicious!,"Out of all the varieties, all of which are amazing, of Taza chocolate, this is my favorite.  The disc is scored which makes it easy to break off bite-sized pieces.  That is the most common way that I use this chocolate but I have used this and other ""flavors"" of it to make chocolate chip cookies which were amazing and even hot chocolate, also amazing.  I often get this with the intention of trying yet another recipe but inevitably the discs get eaten by myelf or a family member before we ever get around to the experiment."
Not tasty,"I thought this would be a great-tasting, healthy snack after reading the reviews. Mine arrived safely and crunchy, unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch. However, they were not sweet and tasty. My sister described it as tasting like cardboard. Now I have 5 whole bags I don't know what to do with. Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy."
Island Cooking Has A Friend,One of the greatest challenges is finding ingredients for Caribbean cooking. Using authentic ingredients helps to preserve the traditional tastes and colors aroma that can only come from duplicating  as close as possible those recipes. Grace foods browning is one of those ingredients that is difficult to find where I live.  So online shopping is a blessing.  On top of that there a videos that help you along and actually demonstrate how these products are best used.  I made a traditional black cake that was the talk of everyone who ate it. I showed up some places without it and they were highly disappointed.
Delicious!,"This is really great stuff, tasting much like a fruit punch. If you're using it with a cup or glass, rather than a bottle of water, I strongly suggest having an inch or so of water in the bottom before you pour the packet in to avoid wheezy clouds of powder; not having a full cup also seems to facilitate mixing the powder, then you can fill the cup up. VERY tasty stuff!!"
great power bar alternative- and gluten free,"We have tried a variety of granola, power bars and others - and this is the best that we have found - good source of energy, all natural, tastes great (we have tried all the flavors and the original is our favorite - followed by chocolate cherry)  And the other good thing is that they don't have all the sodium and sugar that most other bars will weigh you down with.  Great for a snack and the gym or at work."
Not impressed,"The taste just isn't good enough to fit the price.  Overpriced, not healthy enough for that ""organic and good for you!"" price and the taste didn't impress anyone in my family including a slew of teenagers.  It will now sit in my closet. Sticky/chewy/tart/odd flavor is how I'd describe it.  I bought it after reading the good reviews but it's just too strange a taste for us to ever repurchase or to justify that high price."
Yuck!,"I'm always on the look out for low calorie/low point/healthy alternatives to foods that I like. However, this food was a big disappointment. It honestly tastes like nail polish. I saw a review saying that on another website and thought: how is that possible? How can anyone sell a product that tastes like nail polish? But IT DOES! I purchased this at a Super Target for around $4. I, unfortunately, had to throw it away. I think I'll stick to reduced fat or sugar free peanut butter."
Dogswell Sweet Potato and Chicken,"This is a great treat for dogs, they love it.  The cat seems to enjoy a piece also, hope it's good for her.  Recommended."
Hawt and Nummy,"THe name says it all. I have a lovely bunch of coconuts diddily diddily there they are standing in a row. BUm BUm BUm big ones small ones, some as big as your head and bigger! Give them a..... You know the song! I know you do! NOw just refer to the first 1 2 3 4 5 words of this review and there you go."
Yummy,Yummy and a good exchange of nutrition for the calories. The bars are crunchy yet creamy because of the coating. It reminds me of a KitKat bar!
I love this tea,"This is the best green tea I've found. Not only does it have a great flavor when it's hot, it also makes a great iced tea."
"tastes okay, but my kids dont like them","We eat fairly healthy, snacks are fruits and veggies, cheese and nuts...I thought this would be a fun treat for when we are out and about. However my kids will not eat these, and I do not really care for the flavor myself. The yellow package seems to taste better, but they still didnt really care for them. The ingredients looked good so I am bummed the little ones dont like them."
Nice coffee but a little acid,"It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the ""tea-bagging"" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a ""coffee-flavored water"" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods."
The right size for use at home.  Works GREAT!  Looks GREAT!,"This 2-tier, 18-cup design in black is a good choice for most home-kitchen counters.  I wondered if the 27-cup version might be the right choice, but decided I really didn't need the capacity, extra height and expense.  This is a very simple piece of work, and it seems a bit (quite a bit!) overpriced.  However, after a lot of shopping around, I couldn't beat Amazon's deal with Prime.  For sure, there is NO CHANCE that I will ever wear this thing out.  I'm very satisfied with the build quality, durable finish and functionality of this K-cup carousel."
teriyaki tastes better than teriyaki beef,"I love these yakisoba noodles. My favorite instant noodles of all time. This is my least favorite flavor out of the ones they have though, which is why I gave it 3 stars. Teriyaki is the best. Teriyaki beef is mediocre. The taste isn't as good."
Destruction for Your Mouth,"My first run-in with this product was nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />I had finished up my Blair's Death Sauce, which I found to be very pleasant on eggs, so I decided to crack open this bottle.  Usually I do a small taste test first before using the product, but I figured it would be fairly similar to Death Sauce in taste and intensity.  So, like I did with Death Sauce, I put it on my eggs as if it were ketchup.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />With that first bite, I knew I was doomed.  My lips swelled up (I used a lot of it), my glasses fogged over, and I had trouble breathing.  I actually almost called 911 because I feared my throat was going to swell shut.<br /><br />Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />I don't use nearly as much now.  I learned my lesson.  My tongue was destroyed for weeks after that, and I'm amazed I actually didn't have to go to the hospital.  It is as hot as it is delicious, and I couldn't recommend this more ... unless, of course, the hottest thing you can handle is Tabasco.  In that case, steer clear."
UTI,"My husband is a paraplegic and was having UTIs constantly.  Since he started drinking a cup of this tea every morning, he hasn't had a UTI for a year."
"Good stuff, but NOT ready in 2 1/2 minutes!","I recently switched from the original to the whole grain version of this product. This cereal is just as good if not better due to the increased nutritional value, however it does NOT take 2 1/2 minutes to cook like the original refined grain version. This stuff takes a good 7-8 minutes to reach desired consistency, and thus burns to the bottom of the pan even if using super low heat. This won't keep me from going back to the original refined grain version though. I'll deal with the longer cook time and such to obtain this healthier version. When fully cooked, I cannot tell one from the other."
The commonest hing,"Unfortunately, this is the only asafoetida (hing) that is readily available in the US. It is preground and mixed with edible adulterants to make it easier to handle. Unfortunately, due to this processing, the quality is not high. While it will certainly work for your recipe, it is nowhere as good as the chunks of pure sap that are harder to find in the US. Search out the good stuff if you know a reputable spice merchant.<br /><br />If you're in NYC, I've found better quality hing at Dual Specialty Store in the East Village. It's still not as good as the super stinky chunks of Afghani asafoetida that I picked up in Varanasi, but it will do."
What Cats Love,If I don't know where my cats are...I just have to rattle the bag and they come running. They just love these treat.
The Best Gluten Free Bread Mix!,There is no gluten free bread out there like this. This is truly one of a kind. The texture is like normal bread! The taste is like normal bread! Make the mix for a pizza crust and you will love it! I am a Manna from Anna pizza crust junkie! Or make hamburger buns from the mix- you will really like how great they taste. I can't say enough about it!
Great treat that isn't a treat!,"My little Yorkie, Zena loves these dental chews.  After breakfast each morning she barks for one and right before bed.  Keeps the tartar down and she loves them.  I definitely recommend and so does Zena."
MIRACLE SHIRATAKI NOODLES,"THIS PRODUCT (MIRACLE SHIRATAKI NOODLES) ARRIVED WITH SOME THE INDIVIDUAL PACKAGES FULL OF BROWN WATER, AND SOME WERE SWOLLEN WHICH COULD BE CAUSED BY BOTULISM AND SOME PACKS HAD NOTHING BUT WATER INSIDE....I THREW THE WHOLE ORDER AWAY..I COMPLAINED BUT HEARD NOTHING FROM AMAZON...I AM SORELY DISAPPOINTED AND OUT $30.00 SOMETHING DOLLARS...."
Natures helper,I got this after hearing about the healing properties of honey. I had some nasty sores on my leg. Put this on and it stung like heck but it did help speed up the healing process. Not a bad tasting honey either. I keep this with my first aid stuff. Saved me from being sent back to the hospital with the sores.
At first I wasn't sure... then I found the trick!,"Chocolate Tortilla Chips:<br /><br />I bought these and I couldn't decide if I liked them or not.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to have with them.  However, I found two really great things!<br /><br />These chips with red wine!  Amazing!<br /><br />And if you have no shame... vanilla frosting.  salty + sweet.<br /><br />I don't think chips + red wine + vanilla frosting would work, but those two items (seperately) with these chocolate chips are wonderful!<br /><br />I didn't think I was going to order these again, now I've changed my mind."
Trident's Best Flavor!,"The Cool Rush is a great flavor that has become very hard to find in retail stores.<br />I wish the manufacturer would get this back on the shelves soon.  It is long-lasting flavor, and my favorite of ALL gums!"
Yummy Puffs,My 10 month old daughter absolutely loves these things.  I originally bought the gerber puffs and she liked those as well but we use the Plum Organics baby food so I really wanted to stick with the organic stuff so I switched to these.  The strawberry and beet flavor is one of her favorites and she can sit in her high chair and feed herself these with ease.  They are also great on the go.  If she gets a little fussy in the car or while in her stroller these are great to keep her calm.  I also really loved how they come in a 4 pack.  It is really convenient not having to go to the store when one container of puffs is gone.  Also the price is great!  This 4 pack came out to be cheaper than they are at my local grocery store.  Would definitely recommend these for your little one.
My dog loves it!,"We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else."
Love this product but don't buy from them,"Wow, that is some serious overpricing!  Walmart sells these babies for 2.50.  Buy from them, they are the best little snacks to give to your kids.  The healthiest? No but they do taste really good, our entire family likes them.  Nice to leave in the diaper bag so you bring them out when little ones get cranky."
Tastes burnt!,"This cheese is baked until crunchy and is a low carb, low calorie snack.  It tastes burnt and is extremely crunchy, like tooth breaking crunchy.  I will not buy it again."
Great,I was very pleased with this team. The flavor is excellent! I would recommend that you try it. Price was quite reasonable.
poor quality,"Currants are, of course, dried fruit.  However, the currants in this delivery were over dried and quite inferior to the same product by the same manufacturer that I frequently purchase at my local grocery store.  Rather than having a moist freshness, the delivered currants were over dried out to point of having a granular crustiness.  No wonder they were sent to me under Subscribe and Save.  They must have been rejected for shipping to grocery stores dues to their deteriorated quality.  The seller should have indicated this prior to shipping."
Great coffee,"We have high blood pressure, so have to drink decaf coffee. This one is great. Price is very good too."
"I like most low-carb snacks, but ...","These have a very odd flavor, and are WAY too salty.  They don't taste like cheese at all.  I've been living the South Beach lifestyle for years, and typically enjoy low- or no-carb snacks.  I couldn't eat these.  Try Aunt Lizzie's No-Carb Cheese Straws instead (they taste like Cheez Its)!"
absolutely addicting,this truly the greatest sandwich spread/fruit crudite dip i've ever eaten. if you haven't any sort of food allergy prohibiting nut consumption(peanuts included)make it a point to seek this almond butter out. the lack of refrigeration necessity is particularly pleasing as well.
"Excellent, although small servings","Very neat product.  Small pot, but the bloom fills up the pot, which I think is great.  Using actual tea cups its 2 servings, but a coffee mug gets about 1.5 servings per pot."
Bottle pictured is wrong,"(My 5 star rating is based on Mega Death. Haven't tried Ultra Death yet.)<br /><br />The bottle in the picture says Jersey Death Sauce, Not Ultra Death.<br />Why isn't there a picture of the Ultra Death bottle ?<br /><br />It is true that Blair makes the hottest death sauce out there.<br />We have Mega Death but my husband only uses it occasionally.<br />I won't touch that one.<br />If I want to ""Feel Alive""...I'll get another tattoo.<br />:-D<br /><br />I'm was looking here at Amazon for the Ultra Death Sauce but since the picture here is of Jersey Death Sauce, I'm not sure which one I'd receive.<br />Amazon - Please update the picture there to show Blair's Ultra Death Sauce !"
I really like this salt,"I had sampled some Himalayan Sea Salt at a local garden show. A guy in a booth had samples but none to sell, was advertising for his web site to order it... sooo, I went to Amazon and found this one... love it."
Tastes like coffee if you use the right amount,"This took a little trial and error for me to find the right amount.  The directions on the package recommend 1-2 tablespoons per cup as you would with regular coffee.  Way too much.  That is, if you want it to taste like coffee.  If you want it to taste like something bitter, sour, and unpleasant, then follow the directions.<br /><br />I brewed a batch using a tablespoon per cup and subsequently added so much water that I think the ratio is more like 1 teaspoon per cup.  I'll update w/ what I find.<br /><br />All that to say, this is a great alternative for those people who can't handle coffee.  With cream and stevia, and percolated with the 'right' amount of chicory, this tastes amazingly like coffee.<br /><br />My 'litmus test' is that when I add in my creamer, it develops a natural coffee color.  If it's dark, add more water, not creamer.<br /><br />Don't give up.  With everything there is a learning curve."
Organic licorice?  You can't be serious!,"Seems people will buy anything w/ ""ORGANIC"" stamped on it these days.  This pomtastic licorice was pretty tasty.  I like Twizzlers.  Ok, I LOVE Twizzlers, but this stuff gives the old mystery mouth chomper a run for it's money.  It's licorice, it's organic.  You feel like there's a benefit to eating it.  Try some, maybe you'll live longer because of it."
My favorite Starbucks coffee.  Yum!,"I have tried several of the Starbucks coffees and enjoy many of them, but Kenya is my absolute fave.  Waking up to its smell makes me immediately happy :).  Thanks, Starbucks for going all over the world to find very yummy coffees!"
I work Nght Shift.,"This is delicious tea. I work the night shift and I use this tea everyday to help me wind down enough to sleep well. I use it for naps after off days before I have to go to work. I have tried other teas of this sort, but Sweet Dreams tastes the best. I highly recommend it to other off shifters and insomniacs. It works.<br />  Cindy"
Porcini Mushrooms,"The porcini mushrooms are wonderful. They have great flavor and very good quality. I will definatley order again!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002NVKZ4"">Porcini Mushrooms - Grade Extra AB 16 oz.</a>"
Great Coconut Oil,This coconut oil has great taste eaten alone or when cooking. My girls love it when I cook their eggs.
Best Honey in the World,I am a honey fanatic and have tasted honeys from all over the world. My favorite is Golden Nectar Real Leatherwood Honey.
GREAT product!,"These little pouches are so helpful & convenient. I love that they are a serving of fruit with no added sugar! Perfect, healthy on the go snack!"
almond nut bag for making almond milk,This was my first time making almond milk.  The bag worked really well and I couldn't believe how much fiber nut is left in the bag. Very happy with this product.  It would be nice like someone mentioned if they would include a receipe with it on how to make almond milk.
Yummy cereal that is good for you,I love this cereal.  It is a quick way to get protein with the first meal of the day.  Even my 8 year old likes the taste.
My favorite coffee back on Amazon.com--yay!,After I'd discovered this coffee--been drinking it for 3+ years now--I was thrilled to purchase it from amazon.com with free shipping.....until it became unavailable.  So when I saw it again I was ecstatic!  Hope Amazon can keep it in stock.<br /><br />This is wonderful coffee and guests often ask what brand it is.  Started out drinking Douwe Egberts but this is a little stronger.
Delicious Colombian coffee!,"Wolfgang Puck's Colombian coffee is delicious!  I find it to be a smooth and flavorful dark roast with a lovely aroma, yet without a bitter or acidic quality that might leave an unpleasant aftertaste.  It is a bit expensive, like all k-cups, but I think it's worth it due to convenience and exceptional flavor.  I definitely recommend this coffee to others!"
Best Pie Crust Made,"Honey Maid Graham Cracker Crust are the best choice for taste, freshness and texture! They will stay crisp longer with your filling than any other Pie Crust."
Happy it's back.,Glad to see this product available again.  I mix it half and half with whole wheat flour for a wonderfully light loaf that's still somewhat lower in carbs than ordinary home made bread.  Great product.
Almost as good as the real thing,"The Sugar Free Peach rings were delicious.  They are almost as good as the real peach rings, just not as tart.  I just ordered a second bag!!"
Awesome,The item was great and looked awesome! It was shipped nicely and I had amazing customer service! It is great for anybody who loves reeses.
Just okay,"I have to say I was disappointed in these cookies. For some reason the shape and packaging made me think they would be like homemade, soft and chewy. But they are crisp and dry, much more like a Famous-Amos style. The flavor is decent, but when you bite into one you are covered in crumbs because of how crisp they are.<br /><br />If you are looking for a soft, chewy gluten free cookie, I recommend the refrigerated dough from Immaculate Baking Company. I found them at Whole Foods and they're pretty darn close to the texture you would get with a gluten cookie.<br /><br />Again, there's really nothing wrong with these cookies, per se, they just weren't at all what I was looking for."
Disapointed,"If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste."
Great product.,"The chia seeds are great as long as I remember to drink plenty before, during and possibly after.  That's only because I'm too lazy to pre-wett the seeds as indicated on the box."
Great!,Switched over my British Shorthair over to Wellness from Fancy Feast and no more nasty poop issues!  Wellness may be expensive but its worth the cost. Pay now or pay later is the way I look at it and why not take care of your kitty!
Dissatisfied with New ACS Additive,"Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.  Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax.  Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon."
Great product! No hormones or antibiotics in the meat!,"I adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for. He would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly. His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for, so I switched him to it gradually - 1/2 Purina One and 1/2 Newman's Own at first and gradually more Newmans' Own in the mix until finally 100% N.O. Ever since switching about six weeks ago, he has not had constipation or loose stools. I also don't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before. And despite what a few reviewers have written, the chicken and beef used in the pet food, while not ""organic"", is ""natural"" and raised without hormones and antibiotics.<br /><br />According to [...] ingredients list: ""Natural Chicken - Raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100% natural, all-vegetable diet, the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and structural and protective tissues."" Also, the beef is free-range anad range fed w/ no hormones & antibiotics.<br /><br />For me the evidence is clear - this is good quality food, my dog loves it and I love that when I buy Newman's Own products, the royalties go to charity!"
"Tasty, easy to use and good value","I am a huge fan of tandoori chicken and wanted to try my hand at making some at home.  I looked online and found this product with good reviews.  I am glad that I bought it because it is certainly tasty.  It was easy to use, and I made it for some friends and they loved it, too.  I think for the money this product is a good value. If you like tandoori and want to make it at home, I strongly recommend this spice. I would definitely buy this again."
Lurch,"I didn't buy my gum from Amazon, but I believe you should use caution before buying in large quantities. The gum tastes OK, but the aftertaste is horrific. I tried mints and drinking pop (at work) but the lingering taste remained. I had to wait until I got home - where I ate dinner, brushed my teeth and rinsed my mouth out - before I could rid my mouth of the aftermath."
cheecha puffs,My little girl loves then. They taste like chip but gets soft like puffs. Very good for babies when they want a snack
Careful -- it's addictive!,"I got a few plastic jars of various candies to put in my music recording studio so when people come over to record, they can nibble on candy if they need a pick-me-up. I need to be careful not to mindlessly eat twenty in a row, because it is very very delicious."
Addictive,"Pretzel M+Ms have filled the void that Crispy M+Ms left in my heart when they were discontinued.  If you've ever tried Pretzel Flipz, you'll know what this candy is trying to achieve.  The balance between sweet and salty.  Try out a bag at your local store to check them out, but if you think you might like them, chances are you'll love them.  Buy in bulk to save money because you know you'll be going through them by the fistful."
Excellent product!,"I love this drink! The ingredients are a very healthy mix of organic products and the chocolate flavor tastes delicious! I drink this one hour before the gym and it gives me plenty of energy to get through a heavy workout. All of this with only 16 grams of sugar. I just signed up to receive the product monthly, but will probably need that extra delivery every time. Give it a try - you won't regret it!"
Delicious...but buy the dark chocolate for portion control!!,"I wrote a similar review for the dark chocolate.  I bought both flavors from amazon at the same time, and I still have 5 and a 1/2 boxes of the dark chocolate and only 2 boxes of the vanilla and green tea.  I think that says it all.  They are both very tasty, but the vanilla and green tea are just like oreo's to me...I want to eat them all like the cookie monster.  If you are concerned about portion control...go for the dark chocolate.  Less is more."
size isn't as described,Description says 3.2 ounces. These were a small bag that sells everywhere else for $2 or less. These were $5. Ripoff!
A Fantastic Bar!!!!,I am a health and fitness nut and I've tried about everything out there.  I love these bars as they are really filling and taste great (unless you are a sugar addict and need everything to have that super sweet calorie filling flavor!)  I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.
The best tasting hibiscus tea!,"My local grocery store didn't carry it anymore and due to the large amounts of coffee I drink, I like to detox from time to time using this tea. The hibiscus is great for your kidneys.<br />The flavor is great hot or cold. If you are wondering what this tastes like, if you have tried Starbucks' ""Berry Berry Hibiscus"" drink and liked it then you will like this also as the flavor is quite similar. The price is very reasonable, it cost the same as the grocery store including shipping.<br /><br />Definitely will continue to purchase here @ Amazon!"
Tasty and healthy salt,"I've heard about Pink Himalayan Salt from Dr. Mercola pages and after that I have order it. This is great salt, brings the flavor of a meat or whatever you just cook. Great purchase and no guilt about using salt for cooking."
very tasty,I've tried many of the MTR ready to eat meals and this is one of the tastiest. I will buy again.
Delicious,"Yum, yum, yummy!! I included these cookies in the goody bags at my son's 3rd bday party. They are very tasty. Would buy them again."
Just like I was back in Amsterdam,"As the title states....except you get a nice tin as well.  If you are one of those unfortunates who got hooked on these cookies while in Europe, this product will satisfy your jones.<br /><br />Enjoy"
Good taste and quaility,"Delicious as usual for this cookie. Love them. Glad Amazon had them on their website, esp. on sale when I ordered them. Can't beat that."
Poor Man's Blend,"I have purchased several whole bean coffee products in the $35 - $40 range. If you set it up for the discount delivery, the cost can be as low as $31 for the Poor Man's Blend. We thought that for the $$ this was a robust coffee with great aroma. Enjoyed it very much!"
HEAVENLY,"Love, Love, Love this!  A friend recommended this to me about a month and a half ago and there has not been one day that has passed since that I did not start my day with a Matcha Latte frothed with Almond Milk!  Not only does it taste great but it has such a soothing effect.  Perfect way to start my day!  I look forward to it each morning!  Like many, I wish it came in a larger portion size."
"Fresher, Honey Graham Snack Packs","I love Honey Maid graham crackers! These ""Fresh Stacks"" are the same recipe as their longer cousin. It's like the long ones only snapped in half and packaged in stacks of 8. There are 6 packages of 8 in each box.<br /><br />It's a good idea. Smaller packages allow you to open and not have to save the remainder of the package for many days, thus crackers are fresher. If you make smores (with roasted marshmellows and chocolate) these are already the optimal size. And because they are smaller than the regular size, they'll fit in a bag or lunch much easier.<br /><br />One thing to watch out for is that the individual packages are not single serving, there are two servings inside - a total of 260 calories.<br /><br />So, this has all the flavor, in the size I usually break them into anyway. A winning combination."
Eden Foods Shitake mushroom,Product is as described by Eden Foods. Although I boiled it in the water a few times instead of soaking it for 10 minutes first.
Part of my regimen!,"I have had milk supply issues since the day my baby was born, in part due to PCOS and hypothyroidism.  After both my lactation consultant and my baby's pediatrician recommended fenugreek, I finally tried it.  I have worked my way up to 4 capsules, 4 times a day, plus blessed thistle, goat's rue, alfalfa and domperidone.  Only after several weeks of this combination have I finally been able to stop supplementing with formula!!  I don't know which products are doing the trick, or if they truly are each contributing, but I wouldn't stop taking a single one and risk losing my supply.  For the record, though, I started fenugreek first and noticed an increase, though it wasn't until I had this whole combination that my supply has become sufficient.  I highly recommend fenugreek, and after trying several brands, I feel Nature's Way is superior to some others out there."
All around crowd pleaser!,"Counting rescue kitties I have 13 cats that I ""treat"" on a daily basis and not a one turns their nose up on this particular flavor. The fact that they help with tartar control is an added bonus."
Huge taste in a small bottle,"I'm a Manhatten and old fashioned freak; best cocktails on the planet if made right. And Fee's Whiskey Barrel Aged Bitters are just about the best tasting bitters that I've, well, ever tasted...period. Use Maker's Mark or a high-end rye whiskey with Fee's (and a really good vermouth)and you'll have yourself a supremely tasty drink, my friends. My best advice is to drink alone --like all true Vikings do--and you won't have to share with anyone else.<br /><br />Nothing worse than lipstick on a glass anyway..."
Melted,"Seemed like a good deal, I saw some other reviews mentioning melted candy. I was hoping the cooler weather would prevent this, but the bag of candy I received was definitely melted. Now I must force my friend to eat melted candy, and find some new candy for Halloween."
Delicious!,Very good product.  Shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.  Has a long shelf life so it will keep for a long time.  I would recommend purchase of this product.
Awesome theatre style popcorn!!,I bought the pit popper and the popcorn and it is absolutely delicious.  The popcorn tastes like theatre popcorn. Huge hit at the campground!!!  I would certainly recommend to everyone.  The pit popper is well worth the money too.
Yummy,"The cats love these treats and I'll admit it, I use them sometimes when I'm cat herding which can be frustrating let me tell you. The dairy flavored treats truly are tempting and distract the cats long enough to give me a window of opportunity for tactical maneuvering. I'm their favorite person in all the world with these!"
Hip Bones,This  product is very good for my dog and he sits at the pantry door looking forward to it more times a day than is allowed.He really loves them.He also has cookies from the vet.
Another Twisted Masterpiece From Burton,"Here's the plot of 1988's ""Beetlejuice"", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own)."
Valrhona Pearls Crunchy Dark Chocolate,Love this chocolate. I buy Valrhona chocolate all the time in various forms and percentagess of cacao and find the pearls very useful. Valrhona is an excellent chocolate in any form. Quality chocolate is a must in recipes in order to achieve good results.
Just as advertised,"I really like this coconut water, but I was surprised that per 17oz box it's the same price at Wegman's.  Probably won't be ordering again unless there's some sort of discount."
Delicious!,I just tried this new soup for the first time and I'm ordering a case.  It is super delicious - especially if you like a hint of spice!  It's not exactly low fat though at 160 calories/serving and I ate the whole package which they call 2 servings.  But it makes a good meal for 320 calories.
So glad Stash now has Lavender Tea,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
Strange mix,"There were some singles, but lots of the same black tea and breakfast tea (black tea). No Celestial Seasons tea.  Not as much variety as I hoped for."
Delicious,"You would never know it was sugar free or low fat. Even before chilling it is thick, smooth, and creamy with a tangy cheesecake flavor I enjoyed.  With some fresh strawberries you have a decadent snack.  My boyfriend loved it too and couldn't believe it sugar free or that it could have been made from a mix in one step.  Recommended!"
"Great taste, but not very filling","I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon."
Nearly perfect,"This cake is just a touch on the dry side. Other than that, a wonderful GF cake. I can see serving this at a child's birthday party and nobody really knowing the difference. The taste is very, very good.<br /><br />Cooking is easy, obviously. Have to give props for that!"
Delicious,I love these Calissons. They are perfect flavor and texture. So delicious I will definitely buy them again and maybe give as gifts to friends.
BEST COOKIES ON EARTH!,"I have been a fan of Girl Scout Samoas for years, but I've recently moved to a small down, and finding Samoas near me, is impossible.<br />Well, I was at Wall-Mart the other day, and decided I wanted some cookies. Well, I walked down their cookie isle; not sure what to buy...Then, I saw these. I thought to myself 'these sure look like samoas. I wonder if they taste like samoas. LET ME TELL YOU, THEY DO! I bought 2 packages.<br />Well, I loved these so much, I decided to see if Amazing had them. Well THEY DO! 4 packs for 10 bucks! HECK YEA! I am so happy right now, I could jump for joy.<br /><br />These are the only cookies I now eat. They are perfect in every way possible. I am so thrilled Amazon carries them. I hope I can buy them forever! :D<br /><br />I LOVE THESE COOKIES! AND YOU WILL TOO!"
tasty!,"I was very pleased with this purchase.  I feel like I would eat a ton of these in each sitting, and yet the bag still lasted a really long time.  Obviously not the healthiest snack, but who doesn't love some tasty gummy bears from time to time?"
Great fake jerkey,"This is a great jerkey substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. If you don't like your jerkey hot, I suggest you try mild or teriyaki. Otherwise, this is the stuff for you!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!"
"My ""House Yeast"" for Home Brewing","A couple years ago, I decided to simplify my home brewing operation and focus on really ""nailing"" a few recipes (instead of always brewing something different).  And part of that process was choosing a single yeast to harvest, store and re-use.  2308 has a reputation for being excellent but temperamental.  I have found it amazingly versatile.<br /><br />As you might expect, I use this for all my European lagers, but I also use it for my porters and stouts, fermenting at higher temperatures--think of ""steam"" beer.  And, in fact, my IPAs are just that--steam beer (which many beer experts have said resemble IPAs more than anything else).<br /><br />So even if you don't decide to choose a single yeast as I did, with a little planning, you could do a series of beers from a single packet of 2308, save yourself a few bucks--and end up with some very nice beer."
It's water...with some extras added.,"This water is what the description says...smooth, and jolted with some extra minerals to help out after a hard workout.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Water, baking soda, dipotassium phosphate (salt that dissolves very easily; this also controls acidity), magnesium sulfate (epsom salt) and calcium chloride.<br /><br />My original take before drinking the water was ""why on earth can't we just eliminate all the ingredients except for...you know...that water?""  Well, after downing 50.7 ounces after a workout where I was dripping wet with sweat, I think I can answer my own question.  No, the water didn't taste better or magically make me feel like I didn't just workout.  But, as an alternative to Powerade or Gatorade, drinking a bunch of this Essentia water to restore electrolytes is MUCH better than all the Red #40 and High Fructose Corn Syrup you'll find in the flavored junk.<br /><br />Recommend..."
Defines Britishness,This is the only way that I've found to have decent (IMO) tea in the US. A pint mug ensures the correct dosage :) (although my Doctor doesn't agree).
Gluten free puffs!,"My son is currently on a gluten free diet, so I was happy to find these puffs he can eat. He loves these."
Tastes great hot or cold,"I don't care for licorice, but this stuff rocks!  It's a naturally sweet desert tea that tastes great cold too. This is my substitute for soda and helps when you are having a sweet tooth and don't want to eat junk food."
Really good quality gum.,"I have been chewing this gum for years now. The flavor lasts for a decent amount of time, about an hour or so. The gum's consistency and texture is perfect, it's chewable for a very long time. The best part is that it is aspartame and sugar-free."
Great tea,This tea is fantastic.  Everyone I gave it to for Christmas also loved the tea.
Wonderful Dessert,"These molasses like most Alwadi products are wonderful. Get a jar of the molasses and a jar of Alwadi tahini. Mix 1/3 molasses to 2/3 tahini, drizzle on your toast and enjoy as a wonderful breakfast or a great healthy snack. yummmmyyy"
So-so miso soup,"Bought this from a warehouse store. I have had many miso soups at different Japanese restaurants. This one taste nowhere near a decent miso soup. It's a little sour, and don't have enough flavor.<br /><br />But it is very convenient. Perhaps there's something I can add to it to give it more flavor."
UNUSEABLE!!! ESP FOR SMALL DOGS!,I CANT REVIEW THIS FOOD...BECAUSE THE KIBBLE SIZE IS  H  U  G  E<br />UNLESS YOU HAVE A GIGANTIC DOG....I DO NOT THINK YOUR SM-MED DOG WILL WANT TO CHEW THESE! IM SO UPSET BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE CAN OF THIS WANTED TO MIX THE SAME AS CAN WITH THE DRY!
Good overview of the product - assortment was helpful!,"We ordered the sugar free assortment package so we would know which cookies were best for our family - worth it.  We will never buy a few flavors again and now we know which ones (brownie, chocolate ones) we like best and can buy the larger packages at the store.  The larger packages cost considerably more and we are happy not to have experimented with large packages both because of price and waste.  We quit sugar completely (except 15 grams per day - see: Belly Fat Cure) and these cookies satisfy the sweet tooth and provide guilt free snacking.  My husband is a cookie freak and he eats these...the kids are not purloining our cookies...another benefit.  I liked the small bags - they stay fresh, good for tossing into a lunch bag, and have always been a big fan of small samples!"
Works for my dog who is a finicky eater,I crumble up and sprinkle about 4 on top of my Bichons food and he eats. My guy is a very picky eater. I order the chicken and the beef pkgs and he likes them.
Cheaper to buy individual bags than one large bag!,"My husband loves Circus Peanuts (yes, he's probably the only adult I know who likes them!), so I purchased this as a fun part of his birthday present. This product is not one large bag, but 12 snack sized bags. My husband preferred them this way because he could take them to work or wherever and they are already portioned for him. I also compared prices, and at the time I purchased these, it was actually cheaper to get the indvidual bags than to buy one large bag."
~Better Than Coffee~,"Having just purchased my next 12-pack of the ""5-hour ENERGY"" shots [Hours of energy now~No crash later] from Amazon.com, I can say with great certainty, that for less than $1.65/shot, I receive at least 4.5 hours of continuous energy, which enables me to begin and finish any project that I set my mind to. I'm always in a more 'chirpy and contented' mood, and this supplement never leaves me jangled, jittery, or crashing, the way most caffeine-laced products do--no running to the bathroom for frequent potty-breaks, either. I'm so very pleased that they created this product (just for folks like me)! Try some for yourself soon, and see what you've been missing."
My New Favorite K-Cup,"I am a dark-roast coffee drinker, and this is my new favorite K-cup.  Not only is it roasted dark (but not burnt) but it is also very full-bodied and not at all watered-down or weak like some k-cups are."
BEST COFFEE,THIS IS A VERY GOOD COFFEE AT A VERY GOOD PRICE. I SENT IT AS A GIFT AS I HAVE TO USE DECAFE NOW. GREAT FLAVOR.
Oh Man Almost Better Than...,"..At 220 calories for a serving of three 'truffle' balls this candy is sinfully worth it.  I can never get these at any other time of the year than Christmas time.  At least where I live anyway! And now that I know I can get these here and have them delivered to my house...well let's just say I'm going to have to watch my diet in other directions.<br /><br />The semi-soft outer shell cradles a sinfully rich, creamy soft gooey center which is to die for.  Yes I understand that there are thousands of more expensive and presumably better candies out there, but for the cost and ease of purchasing nothing can compare."
AWESOME!,"I loved my Keurig so much that I bought this one for my mother for her birthday, easter, mothers day, 4th of July, etc.  She loves it just as well and uses it every day.  The best product EVER!<br />Be sure and register your machine you get 2 free boxes of k-cups!"
Great Cereal! No Barley Malt in the Gluten Free Version,Great deal on this cereal. I am getting it auto shipped as my family loves this cereal. I saw a review of this cereal about it not being gluten free as it contains barley malt.... well I actually have this product and I checked the ingredients and it DOES NOT CONTAIN barley malt. I think Amazon is listing the ingredients for the non-gluten free cereal.
Amazing!!,The other people who reviewed this oil were right!! It is very high quality!! If you like your toothpicks to be really hot then this is the stuff. The taste of this oil is absolutely amazing!!!
Perfect First Food for Baby,I really wanted to find a rice cereal that had more nutritional value than just plain white rice and I am so happy I found this product. I started my baby on this at 5 months and he loves it. I mix it with Breast Milk and once he starts veggies and fruit I will add that in as well. This does not constipate him either and I love that it is Organic and enriched with Probiotcs and DHA.<br />If you are looking for a great first food for your baby with quality ingredients this is it and you can't beat the price for organic.
Worked for me!,"I read all the reviews so far, and yep, the spray nozzle is pretty junky but I bought enough bottles to swap them out when I needed to. It is worth it to have even a week or two with less mosquitoes. You really need to watch the fluid level in the container and make sure it is sucking.  I use about half the container and then half of another and keep combining them to get a whole one....I know it is not a wonderful process, but the stuff works and is better than getting West Nile or coating your entire body DEET with is ALSO toxic."
DO NOT BUY!,Absolutely TERRIBLE quality.  DO NOT BUY.  I was 100% dissatisfied with the product!  And Amazon does NOT stand by its food sales and offer refunds (unlike my brick & mortar grocery store).  Item was past date & Amazon offers NO returns on grocery; TERRIBLE!
tasty jerky!,good tasting jerky for the price. My father in law had never had it before and really enjoyed the flavor. Definitely recommend.
Excellent Olive Oil at An Outstanding Price...,"As someone who bakes breads almost every other day, I use a lot of olive oil during baking and when eating the finished product.  I saw the Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil as a Gold Box special, read the reviews, and decided to give it a try.  The oil arrived promptly, was well packaged, and there was no damage to the tins.<br /><br />This olive oil has a nice golden color, a lush mouth-feel, and a pleasant peppery after-bite.  The olive flavor is distinct, but not over powering - something that makes it nice for individuals who prefer a milder taste.  In my opinion, the actual taste was a bit nutty - but taste is subjective and very individual, so you must judge that aspect of this oil yourself.<br /><br />When using this oil as a part of my Italian Butter, I did cut the ground black pepper componant so that the other ingredients were not overwhelmed by the pepper taste.  That recipe takes 12 ounces of oil, pepper to taste (usually 6 turns of the grinder), ground sea salt (6 turns), 2 garlic cloves grated on a zester or crushed,  Mince 1 1 /2 teaspoons each of fresh oregno, fresh rosemary, and of fresh sweet basil.  Add all to the oil and allow to steep for several days before using.<br /><br />Unlike better oils, Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil does not give a harvest date or a specific location from which the olives originated.  If you are an olive oil afficianado, this is something that may concern you.  However, if you are looking for an excellent olive oil, at an outstanding price you should give Zoe a try.  I found this to be equal to Costco's Kirkland Extra Virgin Olive Oil in the 1 liter bottle."
"Consistent shot, beautiful crema, wonderful flavor","I couldn't get a good consistent shot of espresso before buying this brand. It's just perfect every time. I didn't really believe that trying a different coffee would make my morning espresso, but it does!"
Just as good as the other brands!,"I was hesitant to try these because I have never had this brand. In the end, I decided it was worth a try as these little boxes cost almost $2 each around here. I must say that these pretty much tastes the same as the more popular brands. I used them in everything from rice to soup and they were good. As a matter of fact, we used the whole box in about a month. I will definitely buy these on a regular basis!"
Best 100 calorie popcorn!,"I really like this product, but haven't seen it around for awhile.  I am glad Amazon carries it. It has the most buttery taste of all the 100 calorie popcorns out there.  Very little unpopped kernels, perfect serving size bags."
Love these!,"What an awesome snack..they really satisfy with very few calories. Taste great in sandwiches, salads, stews...very versatile...I didn't know much about them before trying but am so glad I did."
Not a fan,"I got these because I like the Myojo curry flavored ramen and thought I'd give these a try. Something about the texture is off. The udon are too dense. Even with soaking them in hot water, draining, then adding water for the soup, they're still too dense. The curry flavor is okay, pretty mild, but there seems to be some weird after taste, like maybe these have been in the plastic packaging too long. Either way, I'm going to stick with more expensive Japanese udon or the Nong Shim udon which has the right texture and no weird after taste."
Excellent Quality,"Arrived promptly, canisters were in perfect condition, nuts were fresh and crunchy and very very tasty. Won't hesitate to order these again when I need them.<br /><br />I do admit that since no one had reviewed them yet that I was concerned that maybe I might be looking at getting older product and/or damaged canisters, but that was not the case.. I was very pleased.<br /><br />I trust Amazon enough to know that if product is unsatisfactory I can bring it to their attention and not get blown off... though, to date, I've never had to return anything or make an issue over product quality in food items or hard goods.. that makes me braver in my purchases!"
Makes a great Holiday Reef for diabetics,I bought these in bulk to make a holiday reef for my family. The candies are my favorite and they are sugar free which helps me maintain my sugar levels.
Lack of assortment for amount received.,"This is the second time that I have purchased this from Penguin, although this time it was delivered by Amazon. While I am satisfied with the shipping, for the second time I am disappointed with the lack of variety in the order. Basically you get 2 lb of orange with about .2 oz of the other two flavors. If orange is your favorite flavor that's fine. If not, it is feels like you got cheated. You get better variety in the 4.5oz packages."
$100 bowl of salad,"No plural there. One bowl. We used this for 3 months and it's been collecting dust in the attic ever since. I can see this being an interesting novelty gift for city folk, but that's it. Truly disappointed."
Great job!,"OK, I know there are over 200 reviews, but I just had to add my two cents. THis is by far THE BEST approach to this one cup (kcup) system. Not dispensing with the pod system, which is slightly less toxic to the environment. Ok, so without a doubt a step in the right direction on the kcup systems; but the coffee....WOW..this stuff hits your nose when you open the bag and keeps hitting it each time I open the zip lock I put them into, after opening the original ( slight dig on the company for not making a resealable bag..come on man!  Anyway, can't say enough about the coffee, I have tried just about every bold, dark, espresso, medium roast, you name it, and this one is my favorite so far.<br />I may have to buy some beans or grounds to use to make my own.<br /><br />Thanks!"
Grahamalicious!,"Really delicious, all natural Graham crackers that Dr. Graham would heartily approve of.  Loads of Graham flavor, great crunch, loads of fiber and not to sweet.  What's not to like?<br /><br />My box was free from Amazon Vine, but I will be definitely be buying these from now on."
Best Senseo coffee deal,"Amazon gave me the Best Senseo coffee deal, ever !!! The delivery was sooner than I<br />could ever have thought. My package of Senseo arrived perfectly. No bumps, no package<br />breakage. Overall, a great experience."
Good Oreo substitute,We know a lot about GF producs in my house and my son really likes these cookies.  They are good Oreo substitutes.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cookie part is very hard and brittle.
Delicious.,"Has a distinctive ""candy red hot"" flavor with the bright fresh orange background. Very mild tea, not heavy at all. Very drinkable. Awesome price, too. 2 oz at some stores is $10 or more for other varieties. Delicious.  Thank you!  I have never been to Seattle, but if this is any indication on it, I will go! Reminds me of the cider mills here in Michigan. :)"
Savu Smoker bag for grill,"Great purchase -- perfectly cooked food w/ Hickory smoke  Just throw in some chicken, potatoes, carrots, green peppers and shake in some salt, pepper, and oil.  Cook 50 minutes on a hot grill, turning a few times.  Perfect meal... and easy to use!"
"Once you taste the first, you're officially on a binge!","Like a fellow reviewer, first got these cookies at [...], but cant seem to find them again, so I was devastated (yes, it is possible to feel devastated about cookies you love!) and the search that commenced eventually led me to AMZN.  Now that I've paced my way (I try) through a few of the 12 boxes in the box, I know there's no going back.  The cookies have a mild ginger flavor, and a just-barely-more-than-mild lemon flavored filling in-between.  Delicious!  Gotta try it, trust me."
Very light coffee-  not medium roast,"Let me say I like a medium roast coffee.. and this is NOT a medium roast coffee. I would call this Light or very LIGHT.<br />This comes as indicated in the description in single coffee pods for use with Single pod coffee makers.<br /> I notice when I opened the package the coffee smell was missing.. Now I don't know if that is particular to this type coffee or if my package had a little age on it.. I even opened a 2nd package to see if my first didn't get punctured accidentally.. but sadly it wasn't..<br />  I even brewed this in my  single serve coffee maker on BOLD setting.. but it just didn't do anything to improve it.<br /><br /> I do support the concept of this coffee company but this particular type of coffee is not to my taste.But saying that  everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee and tea so this is just my PERSONAL OPINION AND TASTE.. Just to be fair I am a regular Dunkin donuts whole bean user so that is what I am comparing this coffee.<br /><br />Sadly I won't be ordering more of this particular version but will see what other flavors they may be selling at this company But if you like your coffee LIGHT this might be a version you would enjoy, it just didn't do it for me."
"Only 5 flavors, not 10","The sour jelly bellies are tasty; however, this item contains the 5-flavor mix. The description for 10 flavors is inaccurate and misleading. Amazon.com, please fix this!!!  Either change the description or provide the 10-flavor mix."
My dog doesn't like them!,"My yellow lab, who loves any and all food, does not like these! I get them out and she doesn't come running, so that's the perfect indication. I pull out some other snacks to lure her into her crate and she bounds in - but not with these!"
Good strong coffee,"I think I have tried all the extra bold K cups out there and have setteled on Double Black Diamond. It has a good strong coffee flavor, an 8oz brew has just a little bite at the end but smooths out if you need it to by brewing it at 10 oz.  Dark Majic extra bold is a milder version but still very good.<br />Joe"
Great dog treats for training !!!,"These dog treats are great for my new puppy and any size dog :):) he loves them, they are small  and soft....."
Healthier FIRST Food for Baby= Happy Mommy! Organic Happybellies Oatmeal Cereal,"Being a self proclaimed 'foodie,' I must admit when it was time for my little girl to start solids, I had done more then my fair share of educating myself on what was the best first food, particularly health wise, taste and nutritional value.  While most books and websites still promote the 'rice cereal' concept, I wanted to go outside of the ""box"" for her first food since we have been bombarded with info about how 'white foods' offer no substantial nutritional benefit and it just turns into sugars.  I was thrilled when I came across HappyBellies offerings of Oatmeal, Brown Rice Cereal and even a Multigrain version, instead of white rice cereal.  I eat Oatmeal as a daily part of my diet so I was especially thrilled to be able to offer this to my little one.  Not only does it have DHA and Priobiotics to help with her digestion, something the typical rice cereal does not offer, knowing her first types of solids not only provide her with something filling but is healthier and substantiated with vitamins, it truly was a perfect offering for one of my little girl's first foods.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSS7EO"">HAPPYBELLIES Organic Baby Cereals, DHA, & Pre & Probiotics +Choline, Organic Oatmeal Cereal,  7-oz.

Best waffle mix out there.,"This is the same waffle mix that major hotels use for their breakfast buffets, as well as the one used by many better  waffle restaurants."
Look no further,"I don't own any cats but I got this for my friends cats (who I think are awesome). The cat nip they normally use was getting a bit old and wasn't working as well as it used to. I wanted to get the kitties something nice for Christmas, so I looked on YouTube and saw some videos for cat nip spray. It looked like it worked pretty well on the videos.<br /><br />After looking at reviews for other products, I was hesitant. This was the only 5 star product and despite there being only 2 reviews I decided to take a chance. I am glad to say this product did not disappoint.<br /><br />As soon as I recieved the spray I pumped it a couple of times to prime it and I sprayed it ONCE on accident. No big deal, right? Litterally, one minute later: here come the kitties from the other room. THEY LOVED IT! I don't think I have ever seen them this playful on ONE ACCIDENTAL spray.<br /><br />I sprayed a couple of new toys that I also purchased through AMAZON. Again, one pump was plenty and they went nuts yet again! I wish I had taken a video of it to put up on here. I would definately purchase this product again. If you love to crack out your kitty then look no further. You will not be disappointed."
Love this creamy coffee,"This is my favorite KCup.  I'd describe it as medium-dark, creamy and rich.  And very consistent.  A lot of k-cups seem acidic to me, so i'm really glad i found this one. :]"
Too crunchy with no peanut taste at all.,"I would never buy these peanuts again.  The're as crunchy in as almost tasting stale.  No peanut taste at all!  If you like VERY crunchy peanuts, maybe you might like them....not me. If you're ever in Jupiter Florida come by my house and I will give you both 32 oz. cans!"
Has Potential,"It has a great collection of grains, it tastes good, and even has chicory root fiber, a great prebiotic (selectively nurtures beneficial bacteria in the gut). And the package opens easily and seals back up easily, which is very unusual for a cereal for some reason.<br /><br />The downsides: It smells a little like rancid oil. And although it's nice and crunchy, there is an extra little crunch at the end of the bite that is too much, like a little seed that is a little too hard and cracks more than crunches at the end. And the little seeds got stuck in my teeth."
Great Support,"Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund."
Overwhelming hibiscus,"Knowing that Twinings tends to produce excellent teas, I thought I would give this one a try, since I enjoy orange spice teas. I found the hibiscus flavor overwhelmed the spice flavor."
Fantastic Cupcakes!,"Made the chocolate cake mix for our little guy who has severe food allergies & intolerances.<br />I used flax seed & boiling water as the egg replacer, olive oil, and added a few handfulls of craisins.  Made 24 cupcakes which were so delicious my ""typical diet"" family members were snitching tastes!<br />Very delicious."
Kitty love,"My kitty loves these.  He knows where I keep them and he is so funny, when  he wants some he get on top of the basket and begins batting the bags."
Amazing...but too pricey!,"Received a coconut almond bar as a token gift, I loved it... so good it made me smile! I would like to order more but the $10.00 a bar +s/h is too pricey for me :("
Great Coffee,"If you enjoy strong, robust coffee, you will love Tully's Italian Roast.  I like the ease of the K cups and Tully's makes a very good cup of coffee."
"Great food - cheaper from Petsmart, though","I love this product.  My dog does extremely well on it, and his itching has lessened since starting it.  He eats it without any need for additives - wet food, etc.  Even my cat tries to shove him out of the way for his food.<br /><br />The only con is cost.  It's several $$ more expensive on this website than it is in store.  Once the price falls a bit, I'll be more than happy to purchase it online."
Almond and Coconut Heaven,"If you love the taste of almond and coconut together, you will love these bars.<br /><br />You can taste both flavors separately and together, and the chewy,nutty texture-- with a touch of honey -- is just right.<br /><br />The other Kind bar flavors are okay, but Almond Coconut is a work of art and stands on its own as a culinary masterpiece."
smells  bad  taste worst,smells  bad  taste worst ..  i opened it up and it was the worst smell i've ever smelled.....the only thing i could imagine what the smell compares to it would be the smell of a rank hooker ..  it smelled so bad that my dog ran from the bottle....and the taste was horrific....i used it at dinner and i can still taste it and dinner was about 5 hours ago....disgusting.it was  bad  i will never try it again  ..
Cloves,"I was having sour throad and as part of the natural mediciene, i used it for couple of days.<br />It used to decreas my coughing and allowed me to work properly in office, without disturbing others much."
PERFECT taste! AND Organic = A definite Win Win,"Just like the other reviewer said- as good as from the rice cooker! Or better!<br />Just add a little butter (or margarine) and salt.....mmmmm!<br /><br />This brand of microwaveable rice simply cannot be found in brick & mortar stores (at least not in the Chicago area). I never even heard of it before until I stumbled upon it here- hopefully, Amazon will keep this item, we love it!"
best chocolate ever,"I have had so many difference chocolates, high end to low end, and Gorant's Mill Creek Asst is one of the best I have ever had.  Creamy, different centers you don't find in other boxed chocolates.  The fruit fillings are fantastic.<br /><br />If you want a great gift for anyone, and they love chocolate, this is the box for you!"
Great coffee,The Keurig Green Mountain Nantucket Blend Coffee is great.  The flavor is pleasing and not too strong or too weak.  I like using the subscription plan.
Magical,"Cliff Bar White Chocolate Macademia Nut Granola Bars are BY FAR the most delicious granola bars I have ever tasted.  I eat one (half a pack) right after a workout to help put some health sugar levels back in my body.  A couple grams of fiber, a couple grams of protein, a couple grams of fat = the PERFECT snack for health blood sugar levels for me.  Love them!"
on the move!,This product is very healthy and keeps your digestive system moving in a gentle way.  My doctor said it was safe for me to take.
Big Dissapointment,"This is an instant product that's mostly cream and sugar.  Yes I can taste the hazelnut, but smell it more than taste it.  A small cup is way too sweet and the larger cup is weak.  It's so sticky sweet that I run a large cup of water through my maker to make sure it doesn't clog my machine up.  If you like the instant stuff you get from a machine at a convenience store then this is for you.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q37U"">Grove Square Cappuccino Cups, Hazelnut, Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>"
Too Expensive,They probably don't want you to know this but if you go to grocery outlet this same package of smoked salmon is only 4.99.  At least here in Oregon it is.
HEAVENLY LASAGNA!,"BEING A DIABETIC THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL. FINALLY BEING ABLE, LIKE GARFIELD, HAVING LASAGNA AGAIN. GREAT TASTE AND TEXTURE.<br />PETE"
So far so good,My cat has been peeing everywhere. After a vet visit determined that this was just behavioral she suggested I put my cat on amitriptyline to modify her behavior.  Whenever I tried to give her only half a pill she would spit it out and drool and scratch me all up.  I've only tried this product a couple of times but she loves it so far and I'm so happy not to be fighting with her and getting injured-hopefully she won't catch on to the trick.
"Great taste, great product!","I ordered this popcorn to use with the popcorn marker I got for Christmas. Very good popcorn, I wasn't sure about the coconut oil taste at first but it's a very mild coconut flavor that one can barely taste. I ordered the 2.5 oz size and it makes enough for 2 people to share. I'll order again!"
"Tasty morsels, a little thick","Receiving this product in the mail, I carefully opened the bright yellow box to examine the contents. While most of the cookies were intact, several did have broken parts with crumbs scattered about. Obviously this was due to the shipping and handling, but is something to consider as a possibility when buying products such as these through the mail. Of course, in this situation, even the crumbs were tasty and most of the cookies had no problems at all.<br /><br />Not normally being a big fan of marshmallows, I was pleasantly surprised with the balance of taste between the graham, the marshmallow, and the chocolate. Perhaps the overall flavor was a bit sweet for my tastes, but the chocolate and the graham off-set the sweetness of the marshmallow, creating a feeling of comfortable flavor not too sweet nor bitter at all. Each bite was a pleasure and took me back to childhood full of moonpies. With a flavor and texture similar to moonpies, Mallomars are a slightly healthier alternative and less likely to leave melted chocolate on the hands and fingers.<br /><br />For personal taste, I would have preferred a lesser amount of marshmallow on each cookie or maybe a ""tighter"" less fluffy marshmallow in the middle. This would make the cookie feel crunchier, smaller, and allow for more cookies in a box. Yet there was no denying the excellent flavor and feeling of fun as I ate these delicious morsels. Recommend for chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker enthusiasts."
YUM!!!,These things are awesome!!! Now this is my kind of thing. I'm a bitter/dark chocolate person and this fits the craving.
Definately not a Medium Roast Coffee! Too bold and bitter!,"Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee. If you are a fan of regular Starbucks you'll like this stuff."
Getting my day started,"Good taste, easy to prepare.  One of these cups in the morning at the office gets me started on my day."
Nice,Pretty good coffee I really liked it<br />It is a bit on the strong side or it may be the way I brewed it but it is a good tasting coffee in my opinion.
Some funny tastes,Works great in recipes. But I tried them in my coffee and it has a bit of a funny artificial taste. Will buy some flavours in the large size to continue to bake with.
Only food that my baby loved the first time,"I've been making my own baby food for my 6-month-old, but our pediatrician advised us not to make homemade foods that are naturally high in nitrates until she's 8 months old.  Since we are trying to introduce vegetables first and many of them are on the high nitrate list, I decided to purchase some food, since they are supposedly screened for nitrates.  To my surprise, even the organic jarred foods have bpa in the seal over the lids!  My search for bpa-free packaging led me to Sprout baby foods.<br /><br />This food smells great when you open the pouch (good enough for me to have a try).  When we offered it to our daughter, it's the first time she didn't make a face when trying a new food.  She just opened her mouth for more and ate every last bite in the package!  So far it's her favorite food, and I'm trying not to be too offended that she likes it better than my homemade sweet potatoes and peas!  We are definitely going to try some of the other flavors soon."
Product melted during shipping,"I love this product.  Best taste, texture and nutrition in an all natural bar.  I just started regular monthly shipment of 2 cases from Amazon.  First shipment arrived with the chocolate melted and it is a real pain to eat.  Amazon's fault not Kind's.  Even after putting them in the fridge to harden up the coating.  I receive my next shipment in a week and will let you know if shipping is a problem"
Fresh Tea at a Fresh Price,"Great price on some great tea. I was a bit worried that maybe it wouldn't be so fresh, but that was not the case. I bought a box of both the regular and a box of the decaffeinated for night-time sipping. A great value."
Great Tasting Tea,I dirnk approximately 6 cups of tea per day and found Twinings to be one of the best teas on the market.  It's the only one I use!
Great taste,"Just a hint of honey and lemon, perfect balance, great taste, doesnt even need to be sweetened."
Quaker oatmeal,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQVBM"">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Lower Sugar Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br />This is a great product and the price is lower than any store in my area.<br />I will certainly buy it again"
"great beer, not 12 oz cans",The beer is the best of three brands i have sampled.  The cans are 330 ml which is not 12 oz as the product description says.
Hills Science Diet Oral Care,My cat loves this cat food! He likes the big chunks and if I mix it with another variety which is smaller nuggets he sifts through and pulls out the bigger oral care pieces. Another plus - my cat is 13 and has never had his teeth cleaned. The Vet believes the oral care chunks have been beneficial in keeping down the tartar on his teeth.
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! BUYER BEWARE,I am very disappointed. I did not receive any sleepy time tea yet they sent me African Rooibos. I don't even like African Rooibos. The picture makes you believe you will receive a minimum of 7 cups of the 5 teas shown in the picture. Hopefully Amazon will rectify this.<br />I received the same as the person below me...I wish I would have read the below review prior to my purchase.<br /><br />NO SLEEPY TIME TEA<br />3 Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger<br />7 Bigelow Mint Medley<br />7 Twinings African Rooibos<br />8 Celestial Seasoning Mandarin Orange<br />9 Twinings Pure Camomille
Dissapointed,"I purchased two sweet bay plants from this vendor.  I did not expect a fully mature tree for the price, but I was very dissapointed when I received the plants.  They were less than 4"" in height and although healthy it will take quite a while for them to develop into a substantial plant.  I did contact the vendor and he stated that they grow quickly and to phone him back in the summer if they had not become more established.  Frankly, I think I should have received an acceptable plant in the beginning.<br /><br />Instead of dealing with this vendor any more,I went on line and ordered a plant from:<br /><br />Almost Eden<br /><br />1240 Smith Road<br /><br />Merryville, La, 70653<br /><br />337-375-2114 We appreciate your business, and hope you are pleased also.<br /><br />jeffm@almostedenplants.com<br /><br />This ""SMALL TREE""  arrived promptly and was in excellent shape.  I spent about the same amount as I did for the puny seedlings.  This tree was 3' tall and extremely healthy.<br /><br />I would recommend any looking for a sweet bay laurel to contact the folks at Almost Eden."
great,There is no one anymore that is not low on Magnesium. This is a great product to take before you go to bed. I love that is has Calcium and Potassium right along with it for balance. Helps with night cramps and sleeplessness and heart cramps. It is a must when you take certain medication that will deplete you of Calcium and Potassium!
Blotto cries for it!,"My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet. I did some research, and this stuff is made by the same company, with a nearly identical ingredients list. While i was mixing in his old food with this stuff to acclimate him, he'd pick out the new food until he ate it all, leaving behind his purina!<br />As far as helping his gingivitis, it's helped a little. The plaque has gone down considerably, but the gumline is still reddish. He really loves this stuff, so I'll probably buy this again."
Yum!,I just received a new Keurig and have tried a couple of different K-Cup varieties. I just have to say that for a smooth cup of plain deliciousness this is one of my top picks!
"Great, healthy snack","These crackers are a great way to get whole wheat into your diet & into children's.  They are low in fat & sugar, and they taste great.  I haven't met a child yet who doesn't like them.  The ingredients are good as well."
Why do I have to order two?,Why do I have to order 2 jars of the same jam?  What if I don't care for the taste..then stuck.
"Works good, tastes not so good","Like the product, dislike the tangy orange flavor. Like the cool citrus flavor quite a bit and it doesn't have the herbal lift. Some reviewers comment that it doesnt dissolve easy in cold water. Easy solution: Dissolves well in a little hot water, then dilute to the preferred strength. Used on a 100 km bike ride and finished with energy left over. Product works well."
Not bad for the price!,"I like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha.  This dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, especially mixed with Double Black Diamond coffee.  Though not the very best, it is good, and the price is right, compared to other brands."
delicious bars,I must eat gluten & sugar cane & dairy free.  These bars allow me to avoid my allergies and they taste delicious.  I eat at least one every day.
coconut nectar,"Coconut nectar ia a great substitute for ""bad sugars"".  I use it in baking because of its low glycemic index.  Look for receipes on line for this product & try it, you will not be disappointed.  I made apple muffins with raisins that turned out great.  Just one of the many things that I use it for."
"Thank YOU, Elastijoint! (Cue studio audience applause)","Don't look for this to work right away.  It was a couple weeks before I really noticed any difference. Definitely gave me a leg-up (no pun intended) when I had knee trouble.<br /><br />I've tried both flavors and unless your base for comparison is sodas or sugary-sweet drinks, both are far from terrible.  The taste is better than any other supplements I've ever had to choke down.<br /><br />Excellent product."
Disappointed,"My husband said this wasn't bad, but I found it so acidic and unpleasant that I couldn't even finish my first cup. It brewed up nice and dark, and I could smell the florals and berries in the aroma as advertised on the packaging. Unfortunately, it tasted like a combination of Lipton tea and Folgers. I had been expecting good things from Fair Trade Organic coffee, but this didn't deliver."
Another sad story of bad manufacturing...,"This was one of the best holistic pet food brands on the market. There were many amazing ingredients in this cat food, and it was almost on-par with the other better-than-commercial brands, but not  grain-free. CSftPLS has a few vegetables and grains in it, but it isn't corn-wheat-soy that is so prevalent in commercial brands.<br /><br />Sadly though, because this food is manufactured by Diamond, and the company was involved in a recall in early 2012, I will no longer be purchasing this food for my cat...<br /><br />Full ingredient list:<br /><br />Chicken, chicken meal, cracked pearled barley, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), turkey meal, white rice, potatoes, oatmeal, millet, natural chicken flavor, salmon, turkey, duck, ocean fish meal, flaxseed, sodium bisulfate, egg product, DL-methionine, potassium chloride, choline chloride, dried chicory root, taurine, dried kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberries, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-Carnitine, dried Enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus casei fermentation product and dried Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, zinc proteinate, vitamin E supplement, niacin, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, copper sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, vitamin A supplement, biotin, potassium iodide, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, manganous oxide, sodium selenite, vitamin D supplement, folic acid"
I love it except for...,"This is a great product that I enjoy daily because I can adjust the fizz as well as the strength of the taste. I have my own formula for preparing this drink to meet my personal desire and I have no problem with the artificial sweetner.  The only problem here is the value.  Amazon sells it for more than Kohl's and Kohl's sells it for more than Bed Bath and Beyond.  I look forward to Amazon having a more competitive price so I can ""load-up"" in the near future (hint-hint).  Either way, I like the diet Lemon-Lime Soda mix better than diet 7up. 'Nuff said?"
Best Cookie...So Full of Chocolate,Just got these in today and opened up 2 of the packages to put them in the cookie jar. They were not any broken and they are delicious. So full of chocolate chips!!!! I recommend these to anyone to get. They came to me in a large box with other things I ordered and they were in great shape.
Excellent for dieters or to keep yourself in line,"I've been taking this tea for months now and besides being an enjoyable flavor, it is a great product. It works to keep you regular and consistent."
Pickle gum!,"Great gag gift, the flavor doesnt last long but its cheap! I &lt;3 it, my friends love it. Everyone you get it for will lov eit. Obviously not educational.. But, it doesnt even taste that bad!"
SOOOOOOO SALTY!!!,"I was thinking this was a nice low calorie snack, but I'm sorry - 38% of your sodium in one little packet is obscene!  Not to mention that it TASTES too salty.  It overpowers any other flavor that this soup might have...  Very disappointing...  They should offer a low sodium option that might be more palatable..."
"Nice, effective product, but the taste is horrible..","Don't get me wrong, Fast Twitch is a great product.  However, I was replenishing my supply, and tried the grape flavor..<br /><br />Oh man, it was crazy horrible.  I'm usually fine with tastes, too.  I eventually tossed what was left and switched to pink lemonade. Totally pleased."
Love the Pill Pockets,"We have three dogs. Two of them will let us put the pill in their throat and/or take it with a little bit of peanut butter (I know, I'm a bad dog owner for feeding them fattening treats). We also have a dog who came to us from a rescue, and who had been abused. It broke my heart to force a pill down her throat. The vet recommended Pill Pockets and sent us home with samples. Our dog loves them. She's twelve now and on a regimen of Denamarin for liver and glucosamine for her joints. I can fit both capsules in one large Pill Pocket (with a bit of wrangling) and she eats it right up. Now we both look forward to her pills in the morning."
My dog goes crazy!,"My maltipoo goes craaaazyyyy whith these treats! she doenst eat a lot, but she'll beg for these! Her teeth are very clean too! Ive purchased these treat 3 times now and I will keep purchasing them!"
Amazing customer service,"When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert ""3-4 mm"" to inches and consequently discovered the ""Coarse Grinder Salt"" was almost 1/4"" (1/6"" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!"
These are addictive!,"These crackers are delicious-you don't have to be ""gluten-free"" to enjoy them. Great with salsa or plain. A bag goes quickly!"
Excellent product,"I agree with the other reviews. This product produces excellent results in baked goods.<br />Plus, the price is right on par with what you pay for other products.  If you are just getting into gluten free baking/cooking, this 2 lb box is a great way to see if you're going to like it without spending too much."
Great taste,"Senseo coffee always tastes the same - ""great"".  It is the first thing I want in the morning to get me going.  A nice pleasure to start the day.  I know I'll never run out because it's on subscribe and save (and I do save a lot over local grocery store prices)."
Very nice,Great flavour! The size of container was a bit smaller than I expected. The canister itself is a flat surface but looks very nice. Would make for a good finishing oil or to use in dressings.
Good Chew,"I purchased one of these hoofers at my local PetCo and my small (16lb) dog loves it. The picture doesn't show it that well, but is is the whole hoof of a bovine, the toes with the bones and meat and skin all there. It is dried and not cured, which I am really pleased with.<br /><br />It doesn't smell bad like sometimes just the clipped hoof can, and infact even when my dog has been chewing on it for a long time I don't notice it being smelly. I've had rawhides after being chewed smell pretty bad from the curing chemicals but this hoofer doesn't smell gross. Even though it has more stuff in it than just a rawhide it doesn't get super stinky, a big plus for our apartment since we can't leave chews outside.<br /><br />Over all I recommend this hoofer as a good alternative to rawhides. If you have a big dog you may want to monitor them since it does have the toe bones inside and they are small."
Great Tasting,My husband was just diagnosed as gluten intolerant and he thought his life was over.  Surprize he loved these chips and couldn't believe it.  I did too and am not allergic to foods.  Can't say enough good things about this chip.
shipping issues!,"The issues I have with this item have to do with the shipping.  I have not tasted the product yet, so cannot comment on taste.<br />The first order arrived with one jar compromised and green/white mold on the cardboard box and noticeably less sauce in one container.  The container was not cracked or broken, but somehow it leaked out.<br />Customer Service was helpful and sent a free replacement.  That just arrived today and that package was even worse!  Black, fuzzy mold was widespread on the cardboard box and container label.  This time I just asked for a refund - I'll not try a third time.  The sauce might taste lovely, but it doesn't seem to handle the shipping process very well."
SO SWEET!,"Sometimes I like to Bake, specially during the Holidays is one of my Hobbies, I make all kinds of breads, sweet pastries, cookies and so on. I do not like using raisins they are too BIG for some Bake goods, so many times I use SUN MAID Zante Currants they are plump and sweet, 10-Ounce Boxes, Pack of 6 for the Price listed...now, that's pretty good, where I live there are no Currants to be found, don't know why, I am so happy Amazon has them for when I am ready to Bake again! Thank You"
Can't Get Enough,Great coffee not too strong. I got some not expecting much but after trying it I am hooked. I now have like 6 cups a day! I am pretty sure the stuff cures cancer. I love coffee but I never thought I could love it even more!
excellent tea,Enjoyed all the varieties of teas that were present in the pack.  Was well worth the value and the wait.
High hopes dashed,"On the seemingly endless search for a better alternative to traditional clay litters, I had high hopes for Green Tea Leaves Cat Litter due to the number of positive reviews regarding the product.  Upon opening the bag I found the litter had a pleasant woodsy-tea odor that was not overpowering. The pellets (they can't be called in any way, shape, or form granules) are lightweight and of a comparable size/consistancy to Yesterday's News cat litter (or rabbit food pellets). Upon pouring the litter into the pan, waves of dust bourgened from the box.  Although the manufacturer describes the product as ""low in dust"", it is anything but.  In fact it's worse than many clay litters. The dust didn't end after the initial pouring either; every time the litter box was scooped, the waves of dust made a reappearance. My poor kitties must have a hard time breathing everytime they dig in this litter, and it's probably one reason why they dislike it so much.  The other likely being the consistancy. The litter does clump well, and the odor control is good, however trying to put myself in the cat's paws I had to pose the question; would I rather walk on a sandy beach, or a rocky one?  The answer is obvious; sand, of course. Hence, it's not a big surprise to find that the cats really do not like this product. There is also alot of tracking of the pellets outside the box due to their light weight and size.  In summation:<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - pleasantly mild woodsy-tea odor<br /> - clumps well<br /> - lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - hard pellet-sized litter that annoys felines to the point they avoid the box<br /> - high dust<br /> - high tracking<br /><br />If the manufacturer ever makes the pellets into smaller sand-like granules I'd be up for revisiting the product, but for now the cons far outweigh the pros for my household.  Unfortunately, we have to give the product one thumb and two paws down."
Great treats!,My dog loves these treats and there's enough in the bag to last a long time.
YUMMY FLAVORS!!!!!!!,These are so good. And the price is so cheap. They also have the all salt ones which I have had also. You can't go wrong with these.
YUMMY!  Hummus at your fingertips if you have a food processor.,"I am so excited!  I LOVE hummus, but it's so expensive at the stores.  These garbanzo beans make hummus easily at my fingertips.<br /><br />Throw a can into the food processor, some tahini (found here on Amazon), garlic, and lemon juice, yogurt (or silken tofu--I use the tofu)...maybe paprika (I like the smoked paprika)...and well-la!  Major YUMMY.  I added peanut butter to one recipe and people LOVED it.<br /><br />Hummus is great for you, can easily be made vegan, an goes on everything from fresh veggies to sandwiches to meats.<br /><br />I will be ordering this again and again.  The beans were flavorful and the texture perfect.  The fact that they are organic is a plus, and the price can't be beat."
kluski krazy,"i love the thick, chewy texture of kluski noodles and amish kitchens makes the best. and extremely affordable given the ingredients and expertise involved in its production.  holds up perfectly in soups and stews.  great product! i always have on hand."
This is the ONLY food my dog will eat,"I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it."
best tea ever,"I've searched in every grocery store for this tea and no one stocks it any more, I was so happy to find it on Amazon and the fact it was cheaper than when I could find it in the stores, thanks for stocking it."
Eating hotdogs in peace!,"With four boys and a husband who are all carnivores, I don't have much of a chance! Raised a vegetarian, I now know how to cook meat and will eat some select items, however, I just can't handle eating meat hot dogs. Just not knowing what is in them is very disturbing to me! Well, we finally found a hot dog that the whole family LOVES! Yes, loves! Even my husband will eat these! I feel so much better about feeding these to my family instead of the ""who knows what is ground up in here"" kind!! Thanks Loma Linda! (by the way, my youngest and I love to eat them right out of the can...no bun, no heating...just some mustard to dip it in!)"
Not Bad,I don't like strong coffee at all and normally the only kind of coffee I drink is Tim Hortons. The Gevalia Signature Blend is a medium coffee that even I don't mind.
Unique and delicious,"I am a person who doesn't like soda because it's too sweet.  I am also a big fan of pomegranates.  Consequently, I found this drink to be very delicious.  It is a bit sweet, mostly tart, and very refreshing.  It's really a melody of a lot of fruits, but the flavour is definitely pomegranate-ish.  Best of all, I can drink a lot of this without remorse, since it's way better for you than soda."
Do NOT taste like sugar free cookies.,"Good stuff. I despise the taste of processed sweetners and I was hesitant about what they would taste like, but I was not disappointed. They are very good. Highly recommended."
Pu-Erh Delight,"Love this tea.  I start off each morning with a hot cup of Pu-Erh and then have another cup with breakfast.  All it needs is a packet of Spenda, but I also brew it with a sprig of fresh mint.  Delicious!!"
Good but it is small,"It is on time.  It is real yellow spray rose.  It is buy 50 get 50 free.  The flowers are blooms but so tiny, not the expectation of big bundle that make my girlfriend surprisingly."
"Lovely candies, but hard to find","These candies are the greatest. While I like all kinds of hard candies, this one is the best.<br /><br />A little bit of working at the shell and then you get the soft filling. These are wonderful and I wish I didn't have to buy 5 pound bags to get any at all.<br /><br />Thanks, to whoever makes these. They should be marketed more to consumers."
My daughter now loves mango!,"I think a large part of my daughter's love of mango is because of these fruit snacks. She now will eat chunks of fresh or frozen mango along with mango smoothies. Still, she comes back to her Mango, Banana, Orange snack. I appreciate that these are organic with no added sugar, and that the fruit listed on the front is what is contained in the pouch - no pear or apple tossed in for good measure. This is a wonderful treat for my preschooler."
"Swiss Miss mocha cappuccino  hot cocoa - 8 ct , 6 pack",This cocoa beverage tastes great - just don't add too much hot water to it. Product keeps well at work in my desk drawer and I also utilize some of the cocoa packets for home use as well.  The very affordable price proves to be an added bonus.
I like it for my little wife,"I love K-Cups coffee.  They are easy and one always has a FRESH cup of coffee in less than a minute.  However, coffee this way can be quite expensive.  I myself use those refillable cups that one can find on amazon.  I have a half dozen of them.  I fill them with grocery store cheap brand and set my Keurig for the 6oz expresso cup.  It makes great strong coffee.  My wife on the other hand is lazy and doesn't want to mess with the two seconds it takes to fill the refillable little baskets.  She loves the Green Mountain Extra bold and as I buy it for her she doesn't care how much it costs.  It's good coffee and keeps my wife of forty years off my back.  I'd pay twice as much for that feature alone."
"Decent Product, overly strawberry though","This product falls in line with Orbit's traditional aptitude at creating a good product but the flavor doesn't last as long as some previous products (around 15 minutes compared to the 30 or so with some of their other products) and the first chew on it is an intensely overwhelming burst of strawberry flavor that almost ""burns"" the tongue with flavor kinda dulls the tastebuds after a little while."
I normally Love Larabars but the jocalat was gross.,"I normally love Larabars. I have tried a few favors and have loved them all but there is something really off about the Jocalat bar. They were dried out and when you tried to take a bit out of the bar it crumbed. The box said they were good until Jan 2012 but they tasted old, dried out, just plan gross. I am not sure if this a bad box or if larabar company needs to redo their bar flavor.Bad product!!!"
Burgess Seed Co. dba directgardening.com,"I highly recommend folks AVOID Burgess Seed and Directgardening.com at all costs!  They have been charging orders on credit cards and NOT filling them!!!  They send form letters to avoid refunds and you get the ""talk to the hand"" if you get through to their poor customer service.  There are so many complaints against them and we for one are filing with the Better Business Bureau -"
A Candy Lover Who Wasn't That Impressed,"After all the hype and my needing my sweets to come a little healthier I finally gave in and bought this assortment.  I was disappointed.  Of all the flavors I only liked the rootbeer drops and the spicy mango & spicy lime suckers.  I kind of liked the sour apple but there was only ONE.  Lemon, ginger and watermelon were just okay but the lemon was the only true tasting of the latter three.  Several flavors were just unpleasant (or had an off aftertaste i.e. blueberry) and it was strange how there were the most of those flavors..quite the over-abundance in fact.<br /><br />Most were either too tangy/sour, bland or I didn't like the ""off"" flavor.  The drops are so tiny, You have to eat several to take care of a craving.<br /><br />After 3 teenagers and I tried every flavor and finished off the 3 favorites the rest are sitting in the box untouched and won't be finished for a long time.<br /><br />I guess I'm the odd man out for not liking these (looking at all the high ratings that sucked me into buying these things in the first place...) but it's an honest opinion.  I won't be repurchasing."
Excellent sugar-free candy,"I have tried jelly-beans, chocolate, cookies, etc. that were all sugar-free, but these gummy bears were the best of the bunch. I am not a fan of gummy candies, but these had excellent flavor and the texture and freshness were great. It satisfied my candy craving and did not cause any teeth problems. Keep up the good work with this product."
You may turn into a gummy bear,"Do not order these. They can only be consumed in large quantities. You may develop carpal tunnel syndrome from the repetitive motion of bringing them to your mouth! ;}  Beware!<br /><br />Some people assert that gelatin is a good health supplement. I am trying to convince myself this is true to rationalize my chain-eating of these things. Also trying not to think about where they come from...<br /><br />As other people said, these are way better than those nasty little chew toy gummies that I used to think were kinda good a few at a time, every once in a while. Therein lies the problem. These ones have crazy different flavors to keep your mind entertained and soft chewiness that keeps your mouth occupied with disassembling them. Crazy!<br /><br />You are receiving ten frigging pounds of gummy trouble!!!! Bask in the sick guilty consumptive pleasure of it all!!!!"
Pocket Espresso is the best,This is the best coffee confection available. i wish that it was more easily obtainable here in the US. Is a good way to get a shot of espresso and the best dark chocolate together.
Nice small snack,"Both of my dogs (chihuahua & corgi) love these snacks.  When they see me grab the bag, they start whining for one.  These snacks are small enough to give a few to your dog each day.  I think they are a little too large for training snacks.  They smell absolutely wonderful, just like blueberries.  I will reorder for my little guys."
GAS STATION COFFEE!,"These cappucino k-cups are truly awful. I pre-ordered this one as well as the french vanilla one and they are both horrible. The consistency, taste, and smell are exactly like the cappucino you get out of those machines at the gas station. Don't bother, there are way better k-cups out there...the green mountain espresso one and the gloria jean cappucino ones are much better. Yes you have to mix your own milk in, but you can get creative and get a cheap foamer to use with different flavored creamers. Way better."
"If you like green tea, you'll love this one.","Delicious.  I recommend it.  It tastes good alone, with lemon, with lime, a little sweetner, etc.  And the price is very good - and is also eligible for the free shipping."
Lab loves it,So far it has lasted a lot longer than I thought it would.  My lab loves to carry it around in her mouth.  Beside it no longer has a face it is holding it's own.
Perfect drink on a warm day!,"I was very skeptical about buying this as I have never been a fan of any tea. I decided to give this a shot as I was looking for some new k-cups for my maker and for a new drink as I was getting tired for my packets of flavor added to water. After reading several review I made the purchase. I am very glad that I did! I make this over ice but have learned by trial and error to find the perfect combination of a 16 oz double walled cut filled to the brim with ice. From there I make it on the middle setting. Some people say you can use the pod twice for tea but I only like to use it once and I like the full flavor.  This is a great drink with a good amount of flavor and taste even if you ate not a tea drinker, it is not too sweet either which I like as well."
Wonderfully soothing tea,I love chai tea and this is definitely reminiscent of that. It's got a wonderful aroma and tastes good hot or cold. I'm definitely buying it again. It also reminds me of special home-made tea I had at a NYC Indian restaurant which was fabulous. Excellent tea. Well worth the price!
Heaven in a cup,"You can't get a more satisfying, soothing decaf than this.  I can't drink caffeine within 6-8 hours of bedtime, but with this tea, I can be totally satisfied and sleep like a baby.  Great flavor!"
Time for your medicine puppies!,"Getting pills down a labador is not always easy and it is amazing how they can actually eat an entire piece of cheese and still spit out a teeny tiny little pill!  The Schipperke is even smarter ...  With Pill Pockets we can actually say ""time for your medicine"" and they come running.  Buying these off the shelf (when you can find them) is far more expensive than amazon.com -- we buy in bulk and save a ton.  Not just on the Pill Pockets ... but on the cheese, peanut putter, hot dogs and whole chickes we use to have to buy to hide that teeny tiny little pill!"
Keeps dogs off lawn!,I bought Critter Ridder to keep neighborhood dogs off my lawn. It works wonders! The dogs don't pee or poop on my lawn or groundcover or lift their legs to pee on any anything along the sidewalk border. Not so good for keeping a cat from using the soil under my palm for a cat box--at least it's occasional rather than every day. I highly recommend it for dogs.
Mixed feelings,"I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste."

Incredible Scones,I just discovered these at Marshalls and after trying them went back and bought all they had. But they don't always have them so I came to Amazon. WOW! These scones are a delight! Lightly crusty on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Lightly sweet and absolutely scrumptious. Had them fresh out of the oven with some homemade yogurt. I found mine one day rummaging through a shelf at Marshalls. They don't always have them so I came here. Even at a dollar higher it's worth it! I will NEVER buy a hard $2.00 scone at Starbucks again!
Best Cat Food,"I have fed my cats (successive generations) various grocery store and premium cat foods.  I have found that Royal Canin is the best:  ingredients, palatability and results in a can.  My cat is happy, stays at a healthy weight and loves this food.  Having it delivered from Amazon makes it convenient for me too.  Yes, it is pricey, but so are vet bills."
Love Constant Comment Tea hot or cold,"After trying the sugar free Jolly Ranchers I thought I'd check out the prices for Constant Comment Tea. I was down to my last few teabags. I knew Amazon would ship them quickly. I got my order before I needed it. Again, I bought these here at Amazon because this was the best deal I could find. I even saved more on auto-shipment. Cost-wise I saved about 50%. I love to save my hubby money so I can spend some more."
Great Icing,"This frosting is great, especially if you want to use black but don't want it to taste bitter.  The only thing I don't understand is the price.  This frosting is $1.50 a tube at Wal-Mart."
My dogs love them!,My dogs love these!! They go crazy when they hear the bag opening. My dogs are very hyper so sometimes I give them when I need a little break and they go at it for a good while. This bag works out cheaper than the smaller packages and in store.
Like An Addiction,"I have 2 cats and they are basically addicted to this stuff.  The minute I so much as pick up the bag they come running from whereever they are.  Even if you just say ""yellow bag"" the little ears perk up and they are ready to pounce.  Don't have any idea what makes them so irresistable but they obviously are.  I know other people who have had the same experience with their cats.  Too bad chocolate doesn't have 2 calories per piece like this does."
Natures Path Organic Chocolate chip granola bars,These taste good and I am sure are healthy.  I like them but do not crave them so they are great to hold me over.  Everything I expected!
Raspebrry Chocolate. NOT Chocolate Raspberry.,"There IS a difference! I was under the impression this was a chocolate flavored coffee with raspberry undertones. It's the opposite. I hate the raspberry flavor because it makes it taste like cough medicine. I tried mixing it a hot chocolate mix but it didn't work. That raspberry flavor is very overpowering. Also, it's only one star because I have a tendency to like medium roasts but this is less than a light roast. Watery raspberry coffee truffles with a suggestion of chocolate is a more accurate description. They smell good, though."
very nice,the taste shocked me.....i instantly tasted it comparing it to the 2% i have been drinking all my life...and when you have those expectations it will let you down..when i got over it i noticed it just taste like liquid almonds and i love almonds so its very nice to me...and if you like almonds i don't see why you wouldn't like the taste
delicious!,great all natural product. ingredients: organic bananas & organic strawberries. Can't go wrong. Would prefer a little cheaper price though.
Ready to eat Indian food,Fast and good.  It beats having to stand over a stove to prepare Indian cooking.
Great Dog Food,"Our Jack Russell loves this food.<br /><br />The containers make it easy to serve a portion and refrigerate the remainder.<br /><br />This food looks like people food, not the typical dog food mush."
Fantastic!,I love this!  I have made it for cornbread and also to use as breadcrumbs for cornbread dressing.  It is great to have cornbread again since being diagnosed with Celiac.
Warning: Contains Menadione,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."
A wonderful noodle that's hard to find in many grocery stores.,"This is a thicker noodle which is popular in a Polish dish I make whenever I can find them.  It's the typical Bacon, onion, sauerkraut and noodle dish served with Keilbasa(Polich Sausage).  Thank you Amazon for carrying the item."
Great Syrup!,"I've had my own expresso machine for almost 15 years now, tried many Brands, Monin is by far the best!  Their Banana flavor is the most natural taste of any other Banana flavors."
Best Tea in the World!,This is my favorite tea of all time. I wish it was in all coffee shops and sold at local stores.
Perfect product!,"My new coffee storage drawer is the perfect product! It serves a greatly-needed purpose, looks classy, operates smoothly, is sturdy, and doesn't take up too much space in my kitchen.  It is so handy for storing and selecting from my variety of K-cup coffees.  My order arrived promptly and in good condition  Thanks!"
VERY GOOD,"My son is in MCC in Washington State, he received these items, and so far, no complains."
Smooth tasting coffee,"I first sampled the taste of Jacob's coffee when a friend brought a bag back from Germany for me to try.  From that point on, I was hooked.  The coffee grounds aren't like most coffee grounds, as they're fine as flour.  Like German's chocolate being smooth tasting like silk, so, too, is the taste of their coffee.  No, the bags don't come with a scoop, so you have to experiment as to how much to add to your coffee filter.  But once you figure out how much to add to your filter, it's hard going back to anything else."
Wow,"This stuff does not mess around.  I just had some at Firehouse Subs and I'm pretty sure it's the hottest sauce I've ever had.  But, it was good."
Got what I wanted!,"When looking for this product online (since I couldn't find it in ANY stores) I was concerned because the picture of the product did not match the product name.  After doing much research I found out the UPC number & used it to determine if this was indeed the product I was looking for.  Once confirmed, I ordered it & kept my fingers crossed that it was what I was looking for.... it was!! I was delighted because I absolutely love the Kraft SWEET Balsamic Vinaigrette on my spinach/strawberry salad.  NOTE ~ I spoke with an Amazon representative & he could not verify that this was indeed what I was looking for... thus the reason for the research I had to perform.<br /><br />But, I am happy to report after all this I am happy to have my favorite dressing so that I can enjoy my favorite salad!"
Extra Bold Flavor and Green Packaging (Finally),"My husband likes his coffee extremely strong, so much so that I brew the 5 oz cups and double up on the kcups in a large mug. Basically, he likes sludge, lol.<br /><br />He had been drinking Timothy's French Roast, but the price has gone up again and I really despise the packaging. Really...they're kcups, not bone china, why the need for 2 packages, carboard, plastic and another box?<br /><br />I like the fact that these kcups come in a single box, not as much waste.<br /><br />Anyway, my picky husband said that this coffee was surprisingly good. I'm happy without the extra packaging and the lower price tag.<br /><br />Now they just need to put this on Subscribe and Save."
Tastes good but a bit too sweet for me.,"This tea had a refreshing, fruity flavor that was really delicious. Unlike most other Texans, however, I prefer my tea unsweetened most of the time. So, the Lipton was a little too sweet for my taste. Even knowing that it was honey flavored, I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it is. As a comparison, I like the Lipton Citrus Green Tea in bottles, but it is right on the edge. This was maybe twice as sweet. However, the mango flavor was excellent. Over ice, this tea was great."
Love it!,"My dogs love this puzzle and I think have a lot of fun with it. This is the 3rd dog puzzle I've bought(each were different brands), and this one has been the easiest so far. My one dog caught on to all the puzzles right away but my other dog is a slow learner and it took him a while to get how the other two we had worked, but with this one, he didn't need any help and figured out how to get the treats right away."
"Delicious Angel Food Cake- Fat Free, Fast, and Easy","I bought a case of the Betty Crocker Angel Food Cake on Amazon.com grocery. The price was cheap, the shipping was free, and the cake is easy to make (you just add 1 1/4 cups of water to the mix). What more could you want for a fat free snack? Right after I take the cake out of the oven, I like to put it upside down on a wine bottle (just like my mother used to do!) and pull off and nibble little hunks of the sweet crust part while it cools. Sigh!"
Disappointed,"My husband said this wasn't bad, but I found it so acidic and unpleasant that I couldn't even finish my first cup. It brewed up nice and dark, and I could smell the florals and berries in the aroma as advertised on the packaging. Unfortunately, it tasted like a combination of Lipton tea and Folgers. I had been expecting good things from Fair Trade Organic coffee, but this didn't deliver."
Excellent Product,"I usually find these at my local health food store.  It's a great, tasty product, which I think most people would enjoy.<br /><br />They are great for entertaining when you have family over or friends."
It makes food prep fun,"I am not a chef or even much of a cook. I bought this hoping it would make preparing food for my 7 month old easy and convenient and it is. I spend large parts of my weekends making all kinds of baby food because it is so fun and so very easy. Before I got the Babycook I used my magic bullet which was easy as well but it wasn't nearly as convenient as I had to boil  the apples (I don't have a steamer) and then I could only do a little amount at a time as the magic bullet can only handle so much due to space and power issues. The Babycook is small but it is better than pulling out the wedding gift blender that hides in the back of the pantry.<br /><br />I just read a review about getting mold in the steaming chamber so I rushed over to check to see if I had any especially since I tend to leave the water in there between uses but no, it was clean. I will empty out the water after use in the future and keep an eye out but so far all is well.<br /><br />I also read a review where they said that your baby would grow to not need this but what I have found is that is works great for adults too. My husband does not like vegetables and I have to admit I am not good about eating them myself so how do I handle that now? I use tricks from Jessica Seinfeld's ""Deceptively Delicious"" and add the pureed veggies to our adult dishes. I don't feel as bad eating a large slice of macaroni and cheese pie if it has cauliflower and butternut squash puree in it. So not only am I saving $$ by not buying packaged babyfood but I am also adding good nutrients to our food as well. Will I recoup the cost of the unit when all is said and done? Who knows and frankly this penny pinching mommy doesn't really care."
"Delicious, soft water that seems to work well as an unsweetened Gatoraid substitute","When I tasted the Essentia water, I thought it had a smooth, soft taste. Not a crisp water; more earthy and gentle. It is very easy to drink, and tasty.<br /><br />I didn't just want to taste it and review it, though. I put it through its paces. The first thing I did was pick a hot, muggy summer day to test the electrolytes. I spent some time at the beach, in the sun, walking around. While I always love spending time at the beach, I usually get a headache from a combination of sunglare, heat, wind and inadequate hydration. Even if i bring plain water, I tend to get low enough in electrolytes by the end of the day that a minor headache comes on.<br /><br />I kept the Essentia by my side, drank most of the 1.5 liter container, and got through the day and evening comfortably. That is a real plus in my book, since I don't like sweet drinks like Gatoraid or energy sodas. This was a super easy way to drink water and keep my electrolytes up.<br /><br />With the rest of my Essentia, I decided to gather as many waters as I could and do a larger scale taste test. In front of me I have: Essentia, Function (with electrolytes, from CVS), Kirkland (from CostCo), Crystal Geyser (bottled in the Sierras), R/O water from my parent's filtration system, and plain Southern CA tap water.<br /><br />These are all flat waters, not sparkling. They are all at room temperature. The first two are electrolyte waters, and Kirkland's water has added minerals (for taste, the bottle says). And really, those three taste the absolute best. More on those in a minute.<br /><br />The Crystal Geyser water has the least amount of ""taste"" than the other three bottled waters. It is a little...flat? Boring? Staid? This isn't like wine tasting, so I am searching around for the words to describe the different tastes of water. This one just tastes like nothing more than ""wet"".  Arrowhead, which I often drink at home, has this same unexciting non-taste. Not bad, not exceptional.<br /><br />The reverse osmosis filtered water is tastier. It is a step above those forementioned  ""mountain stream"" advertised waters. It is softer and rounder and more enjoyable in the mouth.<br /><br />The tap water is...ok, blech. Don't drink the tap water in So Cal unless you have to. My parents don't even use it in their coffee.<br /><br />Back to the top three waters, Essentia, Function and Kirkland all have added items. The added ""minerals"", in all three cases, are sodium and/or phosphate bicarbonates. Baking soda, mainly. Also magnesium and calcium source minerals. This is interesting, since Kirkland is not advertising their water as an electrolyte replacement fluid. My guess is that Kirland may not have as much electrolyte particulates by volume? Or it could be the same darn thing in each. If anyone wants to call these compankes and find out, I'd love to know.<br /><br />Which of these three top waters tastes the best? Essentia, to my palate. It is almost creamy, very soft, very delicious. I would absolutely switch over to this brand if the price was right. However, if the Kirkland product was much cheaper, I'd stick to that one. It is still delicious. The Function brand is a little less round, somehow. Less zesty, as far as unflavored water can get. :-)<br /><br />I do recommend trying the Essentia, at least to see if you can taste a difference, since I don't think most of us get enough electrolytes in a day. Getting more can only be a good thing, and its easier than messing around with adding baking soda on your own."
foul tasting,"this is the worst tasting formula i've ever tried. even though the first ingredient is corn syrup (a worry in itself!) this toddler formula tastes sour, bitter, almost has a metallic taste. my son didn't get to try it because i won't give him something so horrible. i thought something was wrong with the tin i bought so called enfamil, and nope - it is meant to taste this way. what are they thinking; producing something so foul! please don't waste money on this garbage."
Very Unhappy,I purchased these cookies for my daughter's school birthday treat. Everyone was unhappy because the cookies were stale! The faces are cute but the product was not.
Great little chips!,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CE79XC"">Chipurnoi Chips Menthol Eucalyptus Candy 1600CT Bag</a><br />These little chips are great for so many things including a dry throat, tickle, cough, and just in general. They taste very good, and can dissolve in your mouth.  I am never without them.<br />My mother had chronic dry mouth and throat (Sjogrens Syndrome) and these worked for her! I have given them to many people, and they love them.  You must try them; what have you got to lose?"
Favorite Dark Roast,"A great  dark roast coffee, my husband and I tried many different dark roast coffees and found that we always came back to  Green Mountain Dark Magic.  It has a full bodied rich flavor."
not happy,"When i read that these were ""long lasting"" i was hoping for a chew that would take my take more than 2 minutes for my 9 month old chocolate lab and 9 year old lab to chew. Not happy with this nylabone purchase!"
Biscoff Family Pack,Product was delivered with none broken. Quality item with a consistent taste. Only thing is these are cheaper to by directly from Lotus Bakery than Amazon and this particular size is not the jumbo size given out on the airline. Next time will by them directly from Lotus Bakery - they have greater variety and are a little cheaper.
Great tasting candy,This is some of the best tasting citrus flavored hard candy I have had.  It was well worth the price!
"Good cofee, I am enjoying it","First time I tried Sumatran Dark Roast. I really like it. I love coffee at least<br />two cups a day, thanks for a good product."
late july organic classic rich crackers,"Excellent crackers! Would highly recommend to anyone who buys the ""Ritz"" cracker.<br />Enjoy!"
SUPERB!,These olives are nice and salty and crunchy and the garlic sweetly mild. Have to have more! I don't normally order food items online but if I cannot find them locally I will be placing an order soon!
Excellent and fresh,"I used a vanilla bean from this package making a vanilla ice cream (from JENI'S SPLENDID ICE CREAMS, an excellent book by the way).  It was fresh and pliable and full of vanilla 'seeds.'  The price is very good (10 vanilla beans for $9!).  I would purchase again."
These cans will always arrive severely dented but the contents are delicious,"When buying very large cans from Amazon.com, you should expect all of the cans to arrive either slightly dented or severely dented. Large cans have more mass than small cans and become dented much more easily. If both the top and bottom of the can become severely dented, opening the can will become extremely difficult. Despite this disadvantage, the whole button mushrooms inside each can are delicious to eat and it's difficult to resist drinking the salt water inside each can because it tastes so good - as good as soup.  The whole button mushrooms in this product are too large to use directly on pizza.  You will need to slice these mushrooms yourself or better yet, purchase cans of one of Roland's smaller-sized whole button mushrooms or purchase their sliced button mushrooms."
"Strong taste, nothing special","This isn't bad water; but it's not great, either.  I don't like to be able to taste my water much, and this has just too much of a mineral taste for my preference.  If there was nothing else around, I could certainly drink it, but I would never go out of my way to buy it, especially at this price.<br /><br />But everyone has their own preference for water.  To give you an idea of mine, I am okay with most bottled waters, but I HATE Nestle Pure Life.  If you like Nestle, you probably like a more flavorful water, and you might enjoy this Essentia.<br /><br />Also, as far as I know, the alkaline pH of this water is a little unusual.  If you have a problem with stomach acidity or GERD, it might be worth trying to see if it helps."
Best way to give meds to your dog.,These are fabulous and I recommend them to any dog owner who needs a way to get dogs to take medication.
Disappointed,"Mostly decaf very disappointed in variety  was pretty awful. The price for 35 k cup variety is great but the variety is bad. Would not buy again ever. The package mostly cocoa decaf and cider. If your looking for mostly coffee find another variety pack. Have gotten packs a few other times on amazon and paid a little more, for sure will pay the extra because this felt like a waste and will throw must of the bag away.  Shipping was very fast with the prime account though but overall a very poor experience."
The best organic choice,"We left the hospital using Similac AdvanceShield but it is important to us that our son's formula be organic.  We switched to Similac Organic.  That product is more widely available (including at [...]) and that was attractive to us.  However, our son became very constipated and his stool became dry and rabbit pellet-like!  We were also concerned with the type of sugar that Similac Organic contains.  Finally, when mixed from powder we found that formula grainy. We switched to Earth's Best and the consipaton resolved quickly and we love how it mixes up.  This is the best choice in organic formulas!"
Fizzy Cola tastes like Coca Cola,"I've bought every candy possible. I've tried every one of the top 50 candies Amazon sells. Haribo Fizzy Colas are the best IMO. Fizzy Cola and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7SYLG"">Zotz Fizz Power Candy, Cherry, Apple, and Watermelon Flavors (Pack of 48)</a> are my 2 favorites. I've tested these out with at least 20 people and everyone agrees that Fizzy Colas are awesome. They have a very distinct cola taste. The usual reaction is ""Mmmm, these are good, do you have more?"" Great for making friends with co-workers."
Gluten Free Cookies,"The cookies are okay in taste. They are a little too sweet for me. They also came completely crushed which didn""t help the texture."
Good Morning Cup,"Love my Keurig Coffee Maker for convenience, but hard pressed to find a K-Cup that is strong enough for my first morning cup without a bitter taste.  Tully's Italian does the job.  I drink my coffee black and like a rich coffee taste, Tully's Italian does the job. Shipment arrived promptly in good condition, although the packing box was damaged, torn and crushed.  A book was packed on the bottom without padding and was badly bruised and rumpled, but the coffee came through okay.  I complained to Amazon but never heard back from them with a sorry or offer to replace the book even though I explained it had been purchased for a gift and was now unfit to use as such.  I explained it was a poor job of packaging a soft cover book, since there was no padding or buffer under or around the book and it was jammed into the bottom of the box -- Amazon never responds to complaints about damaged goods."
Cooks Will Love This Product,I have been using this product -- Amore Sun-dried Tomato Paste instead of regular tomato paste in all of my Italian and other recipes.  It makes a great lasanga and more.  Rub it on chicken before you roast it in the oven.
YUMMY!,"These smell so good and tasted just like ""regular"".  Only wish they were vegetarian.  Can't find any vegetarian ones that can even come close to these, so I'll settle for Kosher for now!"
Simply Delicous!!!,Ok does this product even need an intro....lets just say the contents were in my stomache before I had a chance to review the seller!!!!
Very Good Quality! Excellent Pure inflammation fighter.,"I simply love this stuff. I use it to fight my medical condition because my body creates to much inflammation. So I take 1 tablespoon of this Organic Ground Turmeric Root & a half of teaspoon of cayenne pepper & I put it in a full glass of spring water & one ice cube, then I blend everything together in my little quick to use handy speedy hand mixer called the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FLK0HI"">Big Boss Multi Blender The 15-Piece Hi Speed 300watt Personal countertop Blender Mixing System</a> & after blending I then drink it & this makes a heavenly anti inflammation drink for my self that I also in another glass drink alongside 1 full glass of spring water with 1 tablespoon of this Ginger & 1 heaping tablespoon of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XMAG1U"">Honey Gardens Raw Honey, 2-Pound Glass Bottle</a> & 1 tablespoon of raw organic ground wheat grass powder & a therapeutic dose which is 6 capsules of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FU69T4"">Seagate Nopal Cactus 500 mg,  (180 Veg capsules)</a> that I take out of the capsules of course & put the powder from the capsules in the glass & a real big squeeze of real lemon & all of this also blended & these 2 drinks keep my inflammation down & my pain down & energy up. Great stuff! Go & get some!"
Grove Square Cider Cups Keurig K-Cup,"Delicious apple flavor, low calorie drink. Love these for a ""cup at a time"" treat. No caffeine so great in the evenings!"
Chopstick's favorite,"My Boston Terrier LOVES Stella and Chewy's.  We do feed her the frozen raw patties, but use these as a treat or for fast or on the go feeding.  She gobbles them up like they are a treat and begs for more!  It is hard not to feed her more than the recommended amount because she would eat more if given to her.  I love how they are so easy to take with us and no need for dishes or cleanup!  I also love that I save a couple bucks getting them here rather than at my local pet food shop."
Only one of two she will eat.,"Oh my goodness, I have the most spoiled cat. She loves her treats and there are only two products she will eat. I ordered this on the subscribe and save and this morning I cancelled it. Reason being it takes much longer to get, it comes via the<br />USPS which means I had to walk to the other building in our apartment complex, to my mailbox to get this. Would be no big deal but I am disabled so it is very difficult for me.<br />This subcribe and save is a very good deal if you don't have the problems that I have."
Amazing Product.,Amazing - our puppy won't touch his dog food for three days. We had been spoiling him with treats.  Once we sprinkled the Liver Biscotti on his dog food he finished his bowl every time.  Problem solved and greatly reduced treats.
Delicious!,"I love Quaker products. This bar taste amazing. It actually taste like Banana Nut bread, which I love. A lot of snack bars don't have a lot of flavor but this has so much flavor. The banana isn't too overbearing and the nuts give it a great texture. It's great on the go."
My wife says it works,"My wife is a hard case. No matter what she tries it either takes longer than most people to work, or it doesn't work at all.<br />This tea seems to work for her, although not as well, I'm sure as it would on other people. She's lost a few pounds using this tea. So if you're normal, you'll most likely lose more."
Phoebe's fave treats,These are the only treats my Yorkie will eat.  First introduced by her vet at a ridiculous price.  They keep her teeth super white and she never has doggy breath. I only rated 4 stars because they're not made in the USA.  I get 5 packages through Amazon for the price of one at the vet.
Almost plastic-like,"Strange smooth, plastic-like texture that my cats didn't care for. My oldest cat likes to chew on my Beagle's bones and rawhides so hardness isn't an issue & both my male cats will eat just about anything. Even fruits and veggies. I'm thinking that the flavor/smell (or lack there of) wasn't enticing to them. Oh well, at least the dog will eat them so they won't go to waste. If your cat likes electrical cords or other similar tasteless, yet firm items-these chews just might be for you!"
Surprising,"And it's a good surprise!  I was cautious, expecting either something with no resemblance to meat, or something so rubbery as to be inedible.  Sure, the texture is not EXACTLY like real jerky, it's a bit liquidy for that.  But for a vegan product, outstanding!  It's chewy without being rubbery, far juicier than real jerky(which is a good thing), and tastes spot on.  Granted, the Texas BBQ doesn't taste the way I'd thought it would(I was expecting a tomato-y BBQ sauce flavor), but it's very good, with just the right amount of smoke.  I can't wait to try more flavors!"
"Yummy, But Seemed a Bit Stale...","Hot Tamales are my candy of choice so when i saw this deal on Amazon i couldnt pass it up.<br /><br />Although the candies seemed a bit stale they also were a darker red then I am used to maybe it was a bad batch but it seemed that when these were made they had a weird wax tasted to them, not like the typical Hot Tamales I get in a box from the grocery store.<br /><br />Would I buy them again? Sure but if they had the same texture I wouldnt. I will give them the benefit of the doubt on this purchase and hope that it was just a bad batch.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk."
Just what my husband wanted,"My husband eats LOTS of granola.  I used to make it for him, but once I found Bob's Red Mill granolas I quit.  The quality is great, the flavor good and I think it is much healthier granola than many store bought granola.  There is plenty of flavor and sweetness, but not an overdose of sugar or oils.  The quality is consistent as well.  Overall, an excellent  granola."
"EXCELLENT, GREAT BULK BASIL!","Whatever may have happened years ago is not happening now, 'cause this BASIL IS PERFECT.  BUY BULK AND SAVE A LOT OF MONEY!"
Great tea selection,Great mix of different teas. Seems good quality and especially for the low price. Each blend is pretty smooth so the mix is not something you will only like 1 of the 4.
Not a favorite,"Doesn't have a good taste, I was super excited when this came out and I was looking forward to the skillets from velveeta as i love their macrooni<br /><br />sadly this overly underwhelmed me, the taste is chemical, and the time it takes to make it is quite long.<br /><br />I prefer to just add plain mac & cheese + broccoli and chicken, tastes much better, and is cheaper.<br /><br />avoid it, not as good as it could be, or even should be,<br /><br />never tried the other flavors, proceed at your own risk"
"Burgers, Steaks, Chicken + Mccormick Montreal Seasoning = amazing","Mccormick Montreal seasoning is one of the simplest, best tasting, and versatile seasoning on the planet for virtually any meat. It's awesome on burgers and steaks, but it's also very good on chicken, vegetable kabobs, pork chops, and virtually any other meat. I mix it with soy sauce for burgers, and consistently get asked by my guests what the secret is. They can't believe it when I tell them how simple it is! I also use this in the broiler with a little olive oil with great results.<br /><br />There are few ready made seasonings that I will use when I grill (I prefer to use homemade dry rubs or marinades) and this is one of them. It is the best of the best, and I can heartily recommend it for grilling."
Love these... or at least my dog does.,"These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog."
not great,This tea has a good price/bag but for some reason doesn't have a great or even very strong flavor.
"Great tea, would make a nice gift","All the flavors are very rich and make a large mug of tea.  I typically make a 14-16 oz mug with a single bag and let it steep a little longer than usual.  There was no one flavor that was outstanding relative to the rest, they are all great.  I had previously tried the black tea from tea forte and I did not like them as much as they did not have as much flavor as these.<br /><br />The box is quite nice and I plan to keep it when I am done with and use it to store items in (perhaps use it to take a collection of other tea bags to work)."
Handy to have in fridge,"I found this in a local supermarket, not all carry it.  I would buy it on Amazon if I didn't have to pay double the price b/c of shipping...but if you can find this at a price that is palatable, I'd try it.  It is a mix of parsley, basil, and oregano.  I have no parsley in my garden now b/c it's so hot, so I used a few healthy squeezes of this paste in a butter/olive oil/white wine base for steamed mussels, mariniere style. It did the trick, gave some nice green flecks for eye appeal and tasted good.  It's a quick way to add that little something extra to flavor a dish or finish a recipe."
Tacky,"The absinthe glass and spoon are inferior quality, downright tacky, and too expensive based on similar products found elsewhere.  In addition, the provider does not respond when contacted for instructions to return the item.  DO NOT PURCHASE!"
Great for a fat dog with a sensitive stomach,"My miniature schnauzer not only was putting on a little weight with the lamb/rice, it was making his stomach upset for a while.<br /><br />On the vet's recommendation, I switched to this food and it has been great for him for over a year now.  He also gets way more excited about this food than the previous one.  Highly recommend it."
Awesome!  Better than Pop Tarts!,"I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely ""healthy"" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome."
Dissapointing Coffee,The coffee cups I received were not what I wanted and produced dissapointing coffee - flavor-wise.
noccialata hazelnut spread,"OMG!! It was the most delicious spread I have ever eaten!  I like that it is organic too. Palm oil in the other brand is not heart healthy in the long run. Nocciolata wins my love it vote!!  I like to eat it out of the jar with a spoon or mix it with peanut butter in a sandwich, awesome!! :-) I recommend this product over the popular supermarket brand.  It's really worth it!!!"
Cereal,"This is a most needed healthy cereal that gives fiber and is not fattening.  Helps to be regular .  All Bran, a simply healthy necessary cereal for every day!"
Zico coconut water,"Not the best I've tried, but still just fine, and I will continue purchasing it because the container is recyclable, unlike the ""boxes"" other coconut water comes in."
"Decent training treat, as long as your dog isn't super picky!","Cloud Star's Tricky Trainers are bite-sized, palatable, chewable treats that are approximately 0.5 inches big. They come in three main flavors: cheddar, liver, and salmon. I sampled (well, JP, my dog, sampled) two flavors: cheddar and liver. These treats were perfect sized for putting into a Kong treat dispenser, and were generally palatable (JP finds them much more palatable then dry treats). I found the Tricky Trainers surprisingly more ""dry"" than most pocket-sized treats, however. In other words, they don't seem to be oily to touch, aren't excessively moist, and have a high anti-squish (i.e., firm) factor. This is beneficial if you're using them as true training treats to reward your dog (i.e., storing them in your pocket). Their con: I found the cheddar smell to be repulsive - it has a really strong smell, so if you're cheese shy, avoid. Cheddar is the 5th ingredient (remember, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance (from most to least). For the other two flavors, chicken liver and salmon are listed first. The other con: the number of calories per treat isn't listed, so we don't know exactly how ""low fat"" or ""low calorie"" they truly are. The final con: if you have a super picky puppy that you are trying to train (and are using these as food motivation rewards), these may not work as well as small pieces of hot dog or pieces of freeze-dried liver treats. When it comes to puppy training, finding a treat that your dog can't resist is imperative to get them to train correctly!<br /><br />These products are listed as wheat and corn free, which is good if your dog has these specific food allergies. That said, if your dog doesn't have these specific allergies, not a big deal. The good news: all ingredients are natural, made in the USA, and the products contain no artificial favors or colors. Overall, a pretty good training treat!"
PB2 Is amazing,"Love love love this product. Perfect in smoothies, deserts, also, I mix it directly in jam to make a PB2 & Jelly sandwich. I also like to use the same PB2 & Jam mix to eat with a banana, I either spoon on or dip the banana, depending on the consistency I have."
great product,This product is great.  It has a great taste and is fantastic as a skin moisturizer (or so my wife says).  We both use it regularly.
not traditional chinese chajang mein,"I bought one package just to give this a try.  I love chajang noodles.  I figured nong shim makes my fav instant noodle Neoguri, they probably make a mean chajang instant noodle.  Not the case.  This one lacks a strong black bean taste and is too sweet.  I can see how some may really like this but if you are thinking traditional chinese chajang, this is not it.  I would recommend Kung-Fu brand chajang if you are interested in a good one.  It is labelled as ""soybean paste flavor, oriental style noodles"" box of 30."
Dogs love'em,"I was introduced to these treats when I took my dogs to the vet, and saw her giving them these treats.<br />The dogs went crazy for them!<br />Not only that, but there is nothing in this but pure liver.  No added salt, etc....<br /><br />Healthy treats that my dogs love.  And the price is right, too!"
Great Product!,"These were long and plump, fragrant, and everything I could want in vanilla beans, including a great price....<br />Sure beats those $4.00 per bean gourmet store prices!<br />Add to this the fact that they were delivered quickly and sealed well.<br />I will definitely be ordering these again...... although my figure could do without eating the fabulous french vanilla ice cream I made with these."
"Pricey, But Delicious","These are pods, designed to be used in a single-cup brewing system made for pods.  I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.  I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee."
love this coffee,"I love the maxwell house international coffees, especially the toasted hazelnut..it is a smooth creamy tasting<br />coffee. I keep several different flavors in my cupboard at all times"
Great tasting maple syrup...and it's organic!,"I miss living in Vermont...and this syrup helps ease the pain, especially with pancakes! ;-)<br />It's a product of environmentally-friendly farms, too!<br />Get some for the coming cold months to prepare for those days when it snows and a nice hot breakfast with maple syrup will fit the bill!!"
Great little machine except for the steaming wand!,"I bought this as a treat for my business partner and me because we were always leaving the office and spending lots of ""our bucks"" and Starbucks! When I initially set it up, I found it very easy to figure out and was especially pleased with the quality of the shots that were coming out. Nice rich crema and very hot! Of course the flavor is all in the coffee you buy. You can put to large coffee cups underneath to brew to cups at once which is nice.  I also love that you can adjust the grind and amount of coffee per shot. Sometimes you want it strong, sometimes just a regular cup of coffee strength is nice too.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that you can't change out the coffee beans once you fill the grinder. Not a big deal but it would have been an option I would have chosen in a machine if I had known. I'm also not that thrilled with the plastic build. I know it's hard to find things that aren't made of plastic at a good price, but this one is just a little too ""plasticky"" in it's appearance.<br /><br />Now the big gripe - the steaming wand! It worked pretty well, although it seemed to take about a minute to froth a pitcher of milk. When I took it off to clean it thoroughly, it never quite fit right again and would constantly pop off mid-steam. I would adjust it it and adjust it but to no avail, it would keep popping off.  I found an OEM replacement for it here - [...] and now it works like A DREAM! Consistently frothy milk in less than 30 seconds! I don't know why they didn't make this the wand that is included, but it made the difference between almost sending this thing back to bragging about it to everyone I know! If you already own this machine, definitely spend the 18 bucks to buy the new wand and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />In conclusion, I bought this espresso machine because of the price point. Amazon had the best price I could find! I don't think I would buy this one again, but I would definitely buy a Saeco. After much research, people are always pleased with Saeco and I would have to say, other than that pesky wand, I am pleased with this machine's ability to perform daily and consistently offering up rich espresso with great crema. Next time, I would buy one that allowed me to switch out the coffee and perhaps one that was a little more attractive."
My dog is a junky!,"My dog loves these!!  He will do just about anything for one of these Canidae treats.  I use them any time I have to do something he won't like.  All I have to do is promise him a ""cookie"" and he will let me trim his nails or clean his ears etc.  Before, as soon as he saw the nail trimmers he would go hide, now he will come to me.  Nail trims and ear cleanings have become positive events thanks to these ""cookies""."
Lasted for almost 2 months!,"I received these from a friend for my birthday and they were stunning out of the box. Definitely the prettiest flowers I'd ever received. But the reason I'm on here giving a review is because just today--nearly TWO MONTHS after I received them, I threw away the last stem. The orchids came with so many unopened buds that just continued to blossom for me. So pretty, and lasted so long. I assumed she had spent a small fortune on them, so when she told me where she bought them I was very surprised. Great value."
Terrible coffee and/or cocoa!,"Watery, weak, no coffee flavor & the chocolate flavor is very odd. Seriously, a packet of Swiss Miss blows this away. Whether they call this a coffee or a cocoa, it's a terrible rendition of either.  Good thing my kids like it so it gets used up!"
Very nice and tasty coffee!,"This is an ideal pre ground coffee of high quality beans for those coffee aficianados.<br /><br />Nice to have this in an office break room for all to enjoy.<br /><br />Works well with any sort of drip coffee mechanism and will brew that tasty special cup for full bodied coffee enjoyment.<br /><br />The taste is rich and complex with a kiss of vanilla to smooth it out.  very nice with or without sugar, milk, or cream. There is no bitterness.<br /><br />Overall, most likely all coffee drinkers will like this offering.  The excellent Melitta name assures that it is the finest."
Best chai we've found yet,"We first discovered chai lattes on one of our trips. When we got home, we started looking for a way to make it ourselves. We went through a bunch of brands before finding Celestial Seasonings Original Indian Teahouse. This stuff is the best. Great aroma, better flavor, and strong enough to hold its taste when mixed with soy milk. Add a banana and you've got a light, flavorful, well-balanced breakfast. We mix the tea in batches so it's ready when we want it.<br />Here's our recipe: 4 cups water, one box Celestial Seasonings India Tea House chai microwaved on high for 7 minutes and left to steep 6-24 hours. Remove the teabags, squeezing the liquid from them so you have 3 cups of concentrated chai. Heat in microwave 1 to 1-1/2 minutes on high, add one cup honey. Combine two cups of chai with a half-gallon of soy milk and voila! Chai soy latte on demand."
Delicious and Vegan too!,"I bought these to take to a party at which one of the guests was a vegan. She later e-mailed me to thank me so much for bringing these delicious vegan mints. I confess that I didn't even notice this feature when I was buying them; I just wanted something a little  different from the run-of-the-mill after dinner mints. Try them, you'll like them."
Goldfish Box,"My son eats one box a week and this is the only way I can afford to keep the snack around the house. This is a good deal, it is delivered quickly and I have ordered many, many times."
Wonderfully versatile product!,"Absolutely, love the taste, smell and feel of the coconut oil! I use this product for cooking, and sometimes even eat it out right. I make my own deodorant, and one of the main ingredients is this coconut oil. My girlfriend uses it often as a lotion and tanning agent. Coconut oil rivals, the incredible, editable egg in its many uses. Overall, I recommend this product to anyone looking for better health. The guys at Nutiva make some high quality stuff. Best of luck to all and have a good day."
disappointed,"I ordered this Genco Extra Virgin Olive Oil last year and found it to be quite good.  It had a nice ""olivey"" flavor and I felt safe ordering it again this year.  Unfortunatly this can has none of that ""olivey"" flavor.  In fact it is flavorless! I am very disappointed and will probably not order it again.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MMO8W2"">Genco Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 1 Gallon</a><br /><br />Sincerely;<br />E. Carlson"
sooo good and no guilt -- what could be better?,"I love these bars and even eat them once in a while as a substitute breakfast with yogurt.  They are so good, and not fattening and make a great on-the-go snack in the car or on the plane.  I have tried many other bars, but none even come close.  Every time I give one to a friend, they are hooked.  My 3-year old grandson loves them too, and I feel good that he asks for them as they have no artificial anything and aren't that high in carbs.  The deal on Amazon is the best with automatic shipping.  In most places they cost $2.00 or more each.  In bulk on Amazon they are $1.50 with no shipping charge.  This one is my favorite flavor, but I like most of the others almost as much.  So, happiness in a bar. . ."
great kuchela,great tasting  kuchela. exactly what i was looking for to eat my dhal and rice. will definitely buy this again sometime
Tastes like an Orange Creme Pop. Without any dripping.,"Since I was a kid, I've been a fan of Stewarts Orange Creme Soda and the real Orange Creme Pops at your local grocer and ice cream truck.<br />So when I saw this, I didn't think twice about buying it.<br /><br />If you're looking for one of the best flavors you can find in a candy gum, without added sugar, try Extra's Dessert Delights Orange Creme Pop flavor. Years ago, the only sugar free flavor was mint. These days, it seems anything is possible with the technology of artificial flavors and man made chemicals. Amazing flavor that brings back great memories of better days. The orange Creme pop flavor is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys the real thing. This is the kind of gum I eat the whole pack of in one mouthful. Delicious."
REDICULOUSLY fast shipping!,"I know Chicken Soup is a great brand- our adult Great Dane loves it, so I ordered a bag for the Dane Puppy we are getting for Christmas.  No ability to review the actual product yet, as we don't have the puppy yet, but I'm sure it will be just as excellent as the Large Breed Adult formula.<br /><br />The REAL amazing thing about this product was the shipping.  I'm pretty sure that, even with Super Saver shipping, this product made it to my door within 36 hours of me clicking the ""Submit Order"" button!  That's nuts!  Thanks Amazon!  I'll never be driving 30 mintues to get this great food again- I'll just get it online (same price as I'd pay in the store after taxes are added) and save gas!<br /><br />UPDATE (03JAN12): We are mid-way through transitioning the pup from the crap food the breeders were feeding him to Chicken Soup (about 2/3 cup of each per feeding)...  he seems to love the taste, the kibble is just the right size for a great dane pup, and best of all...  his trips to go poo are already decreasing in frequency and it is getting easier to celan up (more solid).  Can't wait to see how much better it is when we are at 100% Chicken soup in another week or so!"
Great cider,"This is really good tasting cider. If you have ever had those caramel apple suckers it tastes a lot like those. So surprisingly it tastes like caramel apple. I didn't know if it would taste much like caramel apple at first but, it actually does. I love this cider."
Super cute!,Saw this in the 2011 Jelly Belly calendar a while back and knew I had to have it. Just got it delivered today and couldn't be more excited. Much more cute in person and she came with four teeny tiny bags of jelly beans. The opening is a little small but I've got no problem taking the lid of and pouring from her. Can't wait until people see her when they come over! Her head doesn't just sit there it's actually got a little rubber helping to seal the container which is an unexpected plus. Definitely would recommend for any age!
Their motto: If it doesn't suck it isn't Silk!,"I can't comment on the other flavors of Silk soy ""milk"" but this flavor is the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted!  To me it's truly a sin to waste food and I've been know to eat or drink things that were merely abhorrent rather than throw them out, but after one swallow of this liquid refuse I poured the rest of it down the sink.  Because my wife is lactose intolerant I foolishly thought the Silk company could make passable ""yogurt"" since it had added flavors, but no, the predominant flavor was some vague aftertaste that seemed somehow off, as if they used motor oil as an ingredient.  My wife experienced it too, so it isn't just me.  Funny that O'Soy tastes just like regular yogurt and has no aftertaste.  For a delicious milk substitute, try Rice Dream.  The original tastes just like milk while the vanilla tastes just like ice cream!  As a bonus, neither O'Soy nor Rice Dream have sanctimonious commercials filled with sanctimonious actors/athletes who have obviously either never tried a Silk product or they were paid very big bucks to mislead the naive and trusting populous."
So so flavor,"Apparently many people really enjoys these k-cups, but I was not won over.  There are a large variety of flavored k-cups, many as good or better, and at at a better price.  I would go with a variety pack from Timothy's or something else instead of this in the future."
Great shampo,We have a 15 year old Westie and have used this product for years. It's truly one of the best and don't worry about getting soap in your dogs eyes.
The Green Monster,"I've also tried and love many energy drinks and the Green Monster cannot be beat.  The 300mg of Ginseng along with the 2gms of protein building blocks (amino acids) and the 2000gm ""Energy Blend"" all wrapped in the green pixie-stick flavor is spectacular<br /><br />RockStar, Red Bull, Amp, SoBe and many many others cannot compare.<br /><br />I am know as the unpaid Monster evangelist. I even have a 6x8 green M on the hood of my car.  I actively search for replacements and/or complementary beverages but one worthy cannot be found.  If anyone feels that they know of a drink more worthy then M' please post me a note so I can try it.<br /><br />(I have already tried Monster Energy Hitman) loved it too!"
Diamond Rating,A quality product at a great price! Comes in especially handy at this time of year with all of the extra baking!
My dog loves these treats,"I have a Jack Russell Terrier who loves these dog treats...he is a very finicky eater, but he can't wait for one of these treats.  The sweet potatoe is nice and chewy and it's wrapped in a duck jerky that he loves.  I'm so glad I finally found something he will eat."
"Amazing, Delicious, Nutritious","My husband loves these chips. The are high protein, full of fiber, and organic. They are the perfect size to add to lunches, so much better for you than regualar chips. Only problem is they are not always available but we try to get them whenever they are."
love this product,"i love this product !  ive tried several different options,this one is the best. unlike most people, k cups are too strong for me. with this i can make it however i want, and my husband can use the k cups. most products ive tried just dont filter good enough,but this one does. i like being able to just throw it away when im done. its a little pricey,mostly shipping costs, but all in all ,worth it."
Good Afternoon Tea,"As far as flavored teas go this is a rather nice blend with smooth yet bold vanilla spice taste.  It has a good bit of caffeine in it as a pick me up and can be a nice change for an afternoon cup of coffee.  Beyond the caffeine it also purports to be a healthier choice than many other energy drinks.  While I was not overwhelmed by this tea, as I tend to like heartier blends, I would give it a qualified thumbs up."
excellnt,"My hound is surprisingly picky about treats.  But these are his all time favorites.  He, Wimsey, likes all the chicken top/treated Beefeater products"
"Yummy, all natural, gum","I have looked high and low for an ""all natural"" gum that I liked...I finally found Peelu, Vanilla Moxie Mint.  It has a nice texture/consistency and a nice flavor that lasts... a subtle flavor that is not overpowering."
Stale!,"I was really excited to receive this product. However, it was so stale, the pieces of seaweed wouldn't even come apart. I couldn't even eat it, it was so bad and I had to throw it out."
Pleased,"This is a good raw cacao. No strange taste or texture. I wish it was somewhat richer so I'll keep looking at other brands. But for the price, pretty good."
"Good Coffee, Better Benefits","This organic coffee is roasted gently so that more of the beneficial antioxidants remain. The gentle brewing also makes it much easier on the stomach.  I find it delicious, and I don't get the sour stomach that I've sometimes experienced with other coffee, even on an empty stomach.  For the best benefits, it should be brewed with a paper filter.  It's not as strong as some dark roasts, but that's a plus for me."
good treat for destructive dog,"my dog destroys & devours most everything in no time. this lasted for quite awhile & he'd usually get tired before finishing it. it's a good ""busy"" treat, didn't fall apart, and didn't stain or leave much of any mess behind"
Meal Starter.,"Doctor this one up with some veggies, spice, cheese and you've got<br />yourself a dinner on the table in no time. I wouldn't serve it<br />as is out of the box..it needs some pazzazz! Add some peppers!"
What a gift!,"Perceptions about this innovative box of flowering teas and accompanying teapot range from ""Buyer Beware"" to ""Gift of the Year.""  Here's my take:<br /><br />The Good: 9 tea selections that are unique in bloom, taste and fragrance.  Each bloom yields 3 pots of tea. Lidded Glass teapot to view the spectacular blooming.  2 attractive, reusable and sustainable bamboo boxes (1 containing the individually wrapped flowers and a larger containing the whole kit and caboodle.  Amazon's price, which at wholesale is a steal for this type of handmade, artisan product.  And the sensory experience itself is priceless (though many a tea salon now have put a price on it).<br /><br />The Bad:  All selections do not quite yield 3 pots, and speaking of the pot, yes you may want to invest in a back-up.<br /><br />For the price, I haven't seen a better gift.  The nay sayers are looking for a product that would have to retail at twice the full retail value of this set.  And you don't like the flavors?  Isn't that a matter of personal taste?  It certainly isn't a reflection of the tea quality, which is very good.  To add to your experience, enjoy with friends and afterwards flip through The Tea Box by Gilles Brochard."
Great for when you need a bagged tea,"Normally I drink looseleaf tea, but there are times when I need the convenience of a tea bag.  This is a very serviceable flavored black tea in a bag. This has become my go-to bag when I need a quick cup of tea. The scent of this tea is utterly amazing- strong cinnamon, but not overwhelming. I could sniff the packet all day. Flavor is good for a bag. Most important to me is that the cinnamon flavor is present, but not so overwhelming that it is too sweet. All in all, a quality tea, great for when you need a bag."
"Delicious, but strange","These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice."
My favorite blend,"After being assaulted by very strong blends, I finally found a coffee that I like. It has a nice aroma and taste. It does not leave your head spinning with a bad after taste like many other blends."
Aboslutely Deeeelish!,"So I am not really a hard core athlete or anything. Just an average person trying to take better care of myself. I recently started walking 5 to 6 miles a day and reducing my caloric intake (about 1200 daily currently) as I am about 50 lbs over weight. I work with kids and have a very weird schedule, with that it sometimes difficult for me to get a good healthy meal in.<br /><br />So, I found these last week on Amazon and decided to try them. I got the creamy chocolate fudge and it's scrumptious! I threw mine in the freezer for about 10 minutes before I drank it, that's just a personal preference because I like milk products very cold. I have no complaints at all. It doesn't give you that funky after taste I've experienced with other drinks. I am happy I put this on my monthly subscribe list!<br /><br />Enjoy!"
Amazing!!,"When I get cold, I always get severe sore throat (normally lose my voice and bad coughing afterward). Same pattern everytime. I tried many cough drops, spray, etc. to erase the pain but those work for really short period of time only. This time, I tried this tea immediately when I felt my throat getting sore. Oh my goodness, it really worked! My throat felt much better just after one cup, and didn't get that severe pain like I normally do. I'm truly  amazed. I'm not a big fan of the taste of this tea (I thought it's similar to Aveda tea), but it was well worth drinking."
Love These!,I love the ease of buying these online as opposed to going out of my way to the closest Central Market or Whole Foods. Love that I have such an easy and tasty option to the aluminum can tomatoes.
broken cookies,"Bought these for a party...guest of honor's favorite cookie!  EVERY COOKIE IN ALL 4<br />PACKAGES WERE BROKEN!!!!!  So if you wanted to put out nicely...forget it. Just  thrown in the box.<br />Fresh, but broken to pieces! I ended up using them for a pie crust!!!"
love it!,"so far so good! We've only had it set up for a little over a week and we already have a few sprouts! It so easy to set up and looks great on the counter. It's great to have the extra light! Makes no noise at all and it's not too big. Everything has already started to grow, some faster than others of course! I would recommend this pruduct!"
Saved my dog's life!,"Shortly before Thanksgiving last year, my 7 year Staffordshire's health took a turn for the worst. His liver was inflamed, he was going in the house and could not keep food down. Actually, he had been throwing up his food for years. His dad went the same was just 2 years earlier and I couldn't bear the though of putting him down. So I was on a quest to save his life and Christmas. We took off the commercial dog food and I started cooking for him a mix of brown rice, ground meat, veggies, eggs, & oatmeal. He loved it and started to get better within a few days, slowly but surely. I also added a daily supplement of brewer yeast, wheat germ and kelp with a little milk thistle to help with the liver. He really started to put the weight back on and a tablespoon of olive oil was great for his coat. As you can imagine, this can get very time consuming but in those early days it was worth. Well I discovered Natural Life in Wal*Mart and both dogs (got another puppy last year)do very well on it. When my budget allows, I buy 2-3 bags at a time. last week we gave them the regular stuff and the loose stools came back almost immediately. I am going to grab a couple of bags tonight after work. This is the only thing I will feed my dogs from now on."
OUTSTANDING!,Great product and great price. I will order again as soon as I finish these.  Original Cornnuts are very hard to find in local stores and then the price is usually not very favorable.  Shipment was fast and the product is fresh.
Great Cereal,I have this for breakfast everyday with raspberries on top. It is delicious. I always look forward to eating it.
great selection provided,"love van houtte k cups. the selections provided allow one to sample coffees from different regions as well as taste the ""flavored"" coffees without having to buy a complete box of each.  Then, you can pick the ones you like & buy that particular coffee..great concept!"
5Hour Energy-grape 2x12pk,"I'm happy. Great price for the product I rely on, especially when I come home from work, the wife has been stressed by the baby, and I need that last little kick to help her out! I like the berry more than this grape tho."

Best espresso bean you can have! Totally worth the price!,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:20 Mins<br /><br /></span>This is the best espresso bean I had so far. Compare with Lavazza and illy. This bean is way better then this two well know Italian brand.<br /><br />If you understand espresso, the video is enough to tell you how great this bean is. you guys can check out the written review for farther information.<br /><br />PS: Because I have to manage the camera so I over extracted the bean. but the dark brown crema is what you always get."
